731,A,Night at the Museum,PROGRAMMING,"['implementation', 'strings']","Grigoriy, like the hero of one famous comedy film, found a job as a night security guard at the museum. At first night he received embosser and was to take stock of the whole exposition.

Embosser is a special devise that allows to ""print"" the text of a plastic tape. Text is printed sequentially, character by character. The device consists of a wheel with a lowercase English letters written in a circle, static pointer to the current letter and a button that print the chosen letter. At one move it's allowed to rotate the alphabetic wheel one step clockwise or counterclockwise. Initially, static pointer points to letter 'a'. Other letters are located as shown on the picture:

After Grigoriy add new item to the base he has to print its name on the plastic tape and attach it to the corresponding exhibit. It's not required to return the wheel to its initial position with pointer on the letter 'a'.

Our hero is afraid that some exhibits may become alive and start to attack him, so he wants to print the names as fast as possible. Help him, for the given string find the minimum number of rotations of the wheel required to print it.",The only line of input contains the name of some exhibit — the non-empty string consisting of no more than 100 characters.

This time he refused to leave the room to Dima and his girlfriend (her hame is Inna, by the way). However, the two lovebirds can always find a way to communicate. Today they are writing text messages to each other.

Dima and Inna are using a secret code in their text messages. When Dima wants to send Inna some sentence, he writes out all words, inserting a heart before each word and after the last word. A heart is a sequence of two characters: the ""less"" characters (&lt;) and the digit three (3). After applying the code, a test message looks like that: &lt;3*word*1&lt;3*word*2&lt;3 ... *word**n*&lt;3.

Encoding doesn't end here. Then Dima inserts a random number of small English characters, digits, signs ""more"" and ""less"" into any places of the message.

Inna knows Dima perfectly well, so she knows what phrase Dima is going to send her beforehand. Inna has just got a text message. Help her find out if Dima encoded the message correctly.

928,A,Login Verification,PROGRAMMING,"['*special', 'strings']","When registering in a social network, users are allowed to create their own convenient login to make it easier to share contacts, print it on business cards, etc.

Login is an arbitrary sequence of lower and uppercase latin letters, digits and underline symbols («_»).

More precisely, two logins *s* and *t* are considered similar if we can transform *s* to *t* via a sequence of operations of the following types: 
 -  transform lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa; -  change letter «O» (uppercase latin letter) to digit «0» and vice versa; -  change digit «1» (one) to any letter among «l» (lowercase latin «L»), «I» (uppercase latin «i») and vice versa, or change one of these letters to other. 
For example, logins «Codeforces» and «codef0rces» as well as «OO0OOO00O0OOO0O00OOO0OO_lol» and «OO0OOO0O00OOO0O00OO0OOO_1oI» are considered similar whereas «Codeforces» and «Code_forces» are not.

A subsequence of some string is a sequence of characters that appears in the same order in the string, The appearances don't have to be consecutive, for example, strings ""ac"", ""bc"", ""abc"" and ""a"" are subsequences of string ""abc"" while strings ""abbc"" and ""acb"" are not. The empty string is a subsequence of any string. Any string is a subsequence of itself.","The first line contains string *a*, and the second line — string *b*. Both of these strings are non-empty and consist of lowercase letters of English alphabet. The length of each string is not bigger than 105 characters.","If there's no uncommon subsequence, print ""-1"". Otherwise print the length of the longest uncommon subsequence of *a* and *b*.","['abcd\ndefgh\n', 'a\na\n']","['5\n', '-1\n']","In the first example: you can choose ""defgh"" from string *b* as it is the longest subsequence of string *b* that doesn't appear as a subsequence of string *a*.",OK,"a = input()

The game lasts for several moves. During each move the player should choose all lines of the matrix where dwarf is not on the cell with candy and shout ""Let's go!"". After that, all the dwarves from the chosen lines start to simultaneously move to the right. During each second, each dwarf goes to the adjacent cell that is located to the right of its current cell. The movement continues until one of the following events occurs:
 -  some dwarf in one of the chosen lines is located in the rightmost cell of his row; -  some dwarf in the chosen lines is located in the cell with the candy.

This time they are located at opposite ends of the corridor of length *l*. Two opponents simultaneously charge a deadly spell in the enemy. We know that the impulse of Harry's magic spell flies at a speed of *p* meters per second, and the impulse of You-Know-Who's magic spell flies at a speed of *q* meters per second.

The impulses are moving through the corridor toward each other, and at the time of the collision they turn round and fly back to those who cast them without changing their original speeds. Then, as soon as the impulse gets back to it's caster, the wizard reflects it and sends again towards the enemy, without changing the original speed of the impulse.

Since Harry has perfectly mastered the basics of magic, he knows that after the second collision both impulses will disappear, and a powerful explosion will occur exactly in the place of their collision. However, the young wizard isn't good at math, so he asks you to calculate the distance from his position to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses, provided that the opponents do not change positions during the whole fight.","The first line of the input contains a single integer *l* (1<=≤<=*l*<=≤<=1<=000) — the length of the corridor where the fight takes place.

925,A,Stairs and Elevators,PROGRAMMING,['binary search'],"In the year of $30XX$ participants of some world programming championship live in a single large hotel. The hotel has $n$ floors. Each floor has $m$ sections with a single corridor connecting all of them. The sections are enumerated from $1$ to $m$ along the corridor, and all sections with equal numbers on different floors are located exactly one above the other. Thus, the hotel can be represented as a rectangle of height $n$ and width $m$. We can denote sections with pairs of integers $(i, j)$, where $i$ is the floor, and $j$ is the section number on the floor.

The guests can walk along the corridor on each floor, use stairs and elevators. Each stairs or elevator occupies all sections $(1, x)$, $(2, x)$, $\ldots$, $(n, x)$ for some $x$ between $1$ and $m$. All sections not occupied with stairs or elevators contain guest rooms. It takes one time unit to move between neighboring sections on the same floor or to move one floor up or down using stairs. It takes one time unit to move up to $v$ floors in any direction using an elevator. You can assume you don't have to wait for an elevator, and the time needed to enter or exit an elevator is negligible.

You are to process $q$ queries. Each query is a question ""what is the minimum time needed to go from a room in section $(x_1, y_1)$ to a room in section $(x_2, y_2)$?""","The first line contains five integers $n, m, c_l, c_e, v$ ($2 \leq n, m \leq 10^8$, $0 \leq c_l, c_e \leq 10^5$, $1 \leq c_l + c_e \leq m - 1$, $1 \leq v \leq n - 1$) — the number of floors and section on each floor, the number of stairs, the number of elevators and the maximum speed of an elevator, respectively.

The second line contains $c_l$ integers $l_1, \ldots, l_{c_l}$ in increasing order ($1 \leq l_i \leq m$), denoting the positions of the stairs. If $c_l = 0$, the second line is empty.

The third line contains $c_e$ integers $e_1, \ldots, e_{c_e}$ in increasing order, denoting the elevators positions in the same format. It is guaranteed that all integers $l_i$ and $e_i$ are distinct.

Sonya understands that her business needs to be expanded by opening new hotels, so she decides to build one more. She wants to make the minimum distance from this hotel to all others to be equal to $d$. The girl understands that there are many possible locations to construct such a hotel. Thus she wants to know the number of possible coordinates of the cities where she can build a new hotel.

In the end he obtained a single fourdigit integer — the first two digits of it is written on the cube from the first heap, and the second two digits of it is written on the second cube from the second heap.

7,A,Kalevitch and Chess,PROGRAMMING,"['brute force', 'constructive algorithms']","A famous Berland's painter Kalevitch likes to shock the public. One of his last obsessions is chess. For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards.

As before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8<=×<=8 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke.

Kalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client's requirements.

It goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything — for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's needs. You are asked to help Kalevitch with this task.","The input file contains 8 lines, each of the lines contains 8 characters.

There is also an absurdly simple road network — for each pair of different towns *x* and *y*, there is a bidirectional road between towns *x* and *y* if and only if there is no railway between them. Travelling to a different town using one railway or one road always takes exactly one hour.

A train and a bus leave town 1 at the same time. They both have the same destination, town *n*, and don't make any stops on the way (but they can wait in town *n*). The train can move only along railways and the bus can move only along roads.

You've been asked to plan out routes for the vehicles; each route can use any road/railway multiple times. One of the most important aspects to consider is safety — in order to avoid accidents at railway crossings, the train and the bus must not arrive at the same town (except town *n*) simultaneously.

Under these constraints, what is the minimum number of hours needed for both vehicles to reach town *n* (the maximum of arrival times of the bus and the train)? Note, that bus and train are not required to arrive to the town *n* at the same moment of time, but are allowed to do so.","The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=400, 0<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=*n*(*n*<=-<=1)<=/<=2) — the number of towns and the number of railways respectively.

1000,B,Light It Up,PROGRAMMING,['greedy'],"Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are ""lights on"" and ""lights off""). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.

The lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.

The lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.

Since you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.

Find such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.","First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$, $2 \le M \le 10^9$) — the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.

Second line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) — initially installed program $a$.",Print the only integer — maximum possible total time when the lamp is lit.,"['3 10\n4 6 7\n', '2 12\n1 10\n', '2 7\n3 4\n']","['8\n', '9\n', '6\n']","In the first example, one of possible optimal solutions is to insert value $x = 3$ before $a_1$, so program will be $[3, 4, 6, 7]$ and time of lamp being lit equals $(3 - 0) + (6 - 4) + (10 - 7) = 8$. Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.

In the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.

In the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$.",WRONG_ANSWER,"""""""

Sam would spend the whole summer stocking hay to feed Dawn in winter. Sam scythed hay and put it into haystack. As Sam was a bright farmer, he tried to make the process of storing hay simpler and more convenient to use. He collected the hay into cubical hay blocks of the same size. Then he stored the blocks in his barn. After a summer spent in hard toil Sam stored *A*·*B*·*C* hay blocks and stored them in a barn as a rectangular parallelepiped *A* layers high. Each layer had *B* rows and each row had *C* blocks.

At the end of the autumn Sam came into the barn to admire one more time the hay he'd been stacking during this hard summer. Unfortunately, Sam was horrified to see that the hay blocks had been carelessly scattered around the barn. The place was a complete mess. As it turned out, thieves had sneaked into the barn. They completely dissembled and took away a layer of blocks from the parallelepiped's front, back, top and sides. As a result, the barn only had a parallelepiped containing (*A*<=-<=1)<=×<=(*B*<=-<=2)<=×<=(*C*<=-<=2) hay blocks. To hide the evidence of the crime, the thieves had dissembled the parallelepiped into single 1<=×<=1<=×<=1 blocks and scattered them around the barn.

After Karen have found the deterministic winning (losing?) strategy for rock-paper-scissors, her brother, Koyomi, comes up with a new game as a substitute. The game works as follows.

A positive integer *n* is decided first. Both Koyomi and Karen independently choose *n* distinct positive integers, denoted by *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n* and *y*1,<=*y*2,<=...,<=*y**n* respectively. They reveal their sequences, and repeat until all of 2*n* integers become distinct, which is the only final state to be kept and considered.

Then they count the number of ordered pairs (*i*,<=*j*) (1<=≤<=*i*,<=*j*<=≤<=*n*) such that the value *x**i* xor *y**j* equals to one of the 2*n* integers. Here xor means the [bitwise exclusive or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation on two integers, and is denoted by operators ^ and/or xor in most programming languages.

Karen claims a win if the number of such pairs is even, and Koyomi does otherwise. And you're here to help determine the winner of their latest game.","The first line of input contains a positive integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=2<=000) — the length of both sequences.

The third line contains *n* space-separated integers *y*1,<=*y*2,<=...,<=*y**n* (1<=≤<=*y**i*<=≤<=2·106) — the integers finally chosen by Karen.

The game is played on the following field.

Players are making moves by turns. At first move a player can put his chip in any cell of any small field. For following moves, there are some restrictions: if during last move the opposite player put his chip to cell with coordinates (*x**l*,<=*y**l*) in some small field, the next move should be done in one of the cells of the small field with coordinates (*x**l*,<=*y**l*). For example, if in the first move a player puts his chip to lower left cell of central field, then the second player on his next move should put his chip into some cell of lower left field (pay attention to the first test case). If there are no free cells in the required field, the player can put his chip to any empty cell on any field.

You are given current state of the game and coordinates of cell in which the last move was done. You should find all cells in which the current player can put his chip.

A hare works as a postman in the forest, he likes to foul bears. Sometimes he changes the game field a bit, so the current state of the game could be unreachable. However, after his changes the cell where the last move was done is not empty. You don't need to find if the state is unreachable or not, just output possible next moves according to the rules.","First 11 lines contains descriptions of table with 9 rows and 9 columns which are divided into 9 small fields by spaces and empty lines. Each small field is described by 9 characters without spaces and empty lines. character ""x"" (ASCII-code 120) means that the cell is occupied with chip of the first player, character ""o"" (ASCII-code 111) denotes a field occupied with chip of the second player, character ""."" (ASCII-code 46) describes empty cell.

The line after the table contains two integers *x* and *y* (1<=≤<=*x*,<=*y*<=≤<=9). They describe coordinates of the cell in table where the last move was done. Rows in the table are numbered from up to down and columns are numbered from left to right.

It's guaranteed that cell where the last move was done is filled with ""x"" or ""o"". Also, it's guaranteed that there is at least one empty cell.

So you might be quite surprised to find out that the primary school in Japan teaches to count using a Soroban — an abacus developed in Japan. This phenomenon has its reasons, of course, but we are not going to speak about them. Let's have a look at the Soroban's construction.

Soroban consists of some number of rods, each rod contains five beads. We will assume that the rods are horizontal lines. One bead on each rod (the leftmost one) is divided from the others by a bar (the reckoning bar). This single bead is called go-dama and four others are ichi-damas. Each rod is responsible for representing a single digit from 0 to 9. We can obtain the value of a digit by following simple algorithm:
 -  Set the value of a digit equal to 0. -  If the go-dama is shifted to the right, add 5. -  Add the number of ichi-damas shifted to the left. 
Thus, the upper rod on the picture shows digit 0, the middle one shows digit 2 and the lower one shows 7. We will consider the top rod to represent the last decimal digit of a number, so the picture shows number 720.

Write the program that prints the way Soroban shows the given number *n*.",The first line contains a single integer *n* (0<=≤<=*n*<=&lt;<=109).,"Print the description of the decimal digits of number *n* from the last one to the first one (as mentioned on the picture in the statement), one per line.

The pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=×<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.

Initially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.","First line contains two integers *R* (1<=≤<=*R*<=≤<=500) and *C* (1<=≤<=*C*<=≤<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.

Otherwise, output a line with the word ""Yes"". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.

He's simply playing some computer game. The field is a flat platform with *n* trenches dug on it. The trenches are segments on a plane parallel to the coordinate axes. No two trenches intersect.

There is a huge enemy laser far away from Vasya. The laser charges for *a* seconds, and then shoots continuously for *b* seconds. Then, it charges for *a* seconds again. Then it shoots continuously for *b* seconds again and so on. Vasya knows numbers *a* and *b*. He also knows that while the laser is shooting, Vasya must be in the trench, but while the laser is charging, Vasya can safely move around the field. The main thing is to have time to hide in the trench before the shot. If Vasya reaches the trench exactly at the moment when the laser starts shooting, we believe that Vasya managed to hide. Coincidentally, the length of any trench in meters numerically does not exceed *b*.

Initially, Vasya is at point *A*. He needs to get to point *B*. Vasya moves at speed 1 meter per second in either direction. You can get in or out of the trench at any its point. Getting in or out of the trench takes no time. It is also possible to move in the trench, without leaving it.

What is the minimum time Vasya needs to get from point *A* to point *B*, if at the initial time the laser has just started charging? If Vasya cannot get from point *A* to point *B*, print -1.

436,B,Om Nom and Spiders,PROGRAMMING,"['implementation', 'math']","Om Nom really likes candies and doesn't like spiders as they frequently steal candies. One day Om Nom fancied a walk in a park. Unfortunately, the park has some spiders and Om Nom doesn't want to see them at all.

The park can be represented as a rectangular *n*<=×<=*m* field. The park has *k* spiders, each spider at time 0 is at some cell of the field. The spiders move all the time, and each spider always moves in one of the four directions (left, right, down, up). In a unit of time, a spider crawls from his cell to the side-adjacent cell in the corresponding direction. If there is no cell in the given direction, then the spider leaves the park. The spiders do not interfere with each other as they move. Specifically, one cell can have multiple spiders at the same time.

Om Nom isn't yet sure where to start his walk from but he definitely wants:
 -  to start walking at time 0 at an upper row cell of the field (it is guaranteed that the cells in this row do not contain any spiders); -  to walk by moving down the field towards the lowest row (the walk ends when Om Nom leaves the boundaries of the park). 
We know that Om Nom moves by jumping. One jump takes one time unit and transports the little monster from his cell to either a side-adjacent cell on the lower row or outside the park boundaries.

Each time Om Nom lands in a cell he sees all the spiders that have come to that cell at this moment of time. Om Nom wants to choose the optimal cell to start the walk from. That's why he wonders: for each possible starting cell, how many spiders will he see during the walk if he starts from this cell? Help him and calculate the required value for each possible starting cell.","The first line contains three integers *n*,<=*m*,<=*k* (2<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=2000; 0<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=*m*(*n*<=-<=1)). 

Each of the next *n* lines contains *m* characters — the description of the park. The characters in the *i*-th line describe the *i*-th row of the park field. If the character in the line equals ""."", that means that the corresponding cell of the field is empty; otherwise, the character in the line will equal one of the four characters: ""L"" (meaning that this cell has a spider at time 0, moving left), ""R"" (a spider moving right), ""U"" (a spider moving up), ""D"" (a spider moving down). 

It is guaranteed that the first row doesn't contain any spiders. It is guaranteed that the description of the field contains no extra characters. It is guaranteed that at time 0 the field contains exactly *k* spiders.",Print *m* integers: the *j*-th integer must show the number of spiders Om Nom will see if he starts his walk from the *j*-th cell of the first row.

33,A,What is for dinner?,PROGRAMMING,"['greedy', 'implementation']","In one little known, but very beautiful country called Waterland, lives a lovely shark Valerie. Like all the sharks, she has several rows of teeth, and feeds on crucians. One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are ""relaxing"".

For a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap).

It turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again. 

Unhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her. For sure, the shark couldn't say no to her favourite meal, but she had no desire to go back to the dentist. That's why she decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that the viability of no tooth becomes negative. 

As Valerie is not good at mathematics, she asked you to help her to find out the total amount of crucians that she can consume for dinner.

We should remind you that while eating one crucian Valerie uses exactly one row of teeth and the viability of each tooth from this row decreases by one.","The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=1000,<=0<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=106) — total amount of Valerie's teeth, amount of tooth rows and amount of crucians in Valerie's portion for dinner. Then follow *n* lines, each containing two integers: *r* (1<=≤<=*r*<=≤<=*m*) — index of the row, where belongs the corresponding tooth, and *c* (0<=≤<=*c*<=≤<=106) — its residual viability.

It's guaranteed that each tooth row has positive amount of teeth.",In the first line output the maximum amount of crucians that Valerie can consume for dinner.,"['4 3 18\n2 3\n1 2\n3 6\n2 3\n', '2 2 13\n1 13\n2 12\n']","['11\n', '13\n']",none,RUNTIME_ERROR,"import |

208,A,Dubstep,PROGRAMMING,['strings'],"Vasya works as a DJ in the best Berland nightclub, and he often uses dubstep music in his performance. Recently, he has decided to take a couple of old songs and make dubstep remixes from them.

Let's assume that a song consists of some number of words. To make the dubstep remix of this song, Vasya inserts a certain number of words ""WUB"" before the first word of the song (the number may be zero), after the last word (the number may be zero), and between words (at least one between any pair of neighbouring words), and then the boy glues together all the words, including ""WUB"", in one string and plays the song at the club.

For example, a song with words ""I AM X"" can transform into a dubstep remix as ""WUBWUBIWUBAMWUBWUBX"" and cannot transform into ""WUBWUBIAMWUBX"".

One can get to the shore only by hills that are situated along a straight line that connects the little island with the shore.

Thumbelina is too small to make such jumps. Fortunately, a family of frogs living in the swamp suggests to help her. Each frog agrees to give Thumbelina a ride but Thumbelina should choose only one frog. Each frog has a certain jump length.

However, there is one more problem: mosquitoes also live in the swamp. At the moment they have a siesta, and they are having a nap on some hills. If the frog jumps on a hill with a mosquito the frog will smash it. The frogs Thumbelina has met are pacifists, so they will find the death of each mosquito very much sad.

227,B,Effective Approach,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.

According to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.

Vasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.

To finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.

But the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.","The first line contains integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105) — the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the elements of array. 

The third line contains integer *m* (1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=105) — the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=≤<=*b**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the search queries.

89,E,Fire and Ice,PROGRAMMING,['greedy'],"The Fire Lord attacked the Frost Kingdom. He has already got to the Ice Fortress, where the Snow Queen dwells. He arranged his army on a segment *n* in length not far from the city walls. And only the frost magician Solomon can save the Frost Kingdom.

The *n*-long segment is located at a distance equal exactly to 1 from the castle walls. It can be imaginarily divided into unit segments. On some of the unit segments fire demons are located — no more than one demon per position. Each demon is characterised by his strength - by some positive integer. We can regard the fire demons being idle.

Initially Solomon is positioned on the fortress wall. He can perform the following actions several times in a row: 
-  ""L"" — Solomon shifts one unit to the left. This movement cannot be performed on the castle wall.-  ""R"" — Solomon shifts one unit to the left. This movement cannot be performed if there's no ice block to the right.-  ""A"" — If there's nothing to the right of Solomon, then Solomon creates an ice block that immediately freezes to the block that Solomon is currently standing on. If there already is an ice block, then Solomon destroys it. At that the ice blocks to the right of the destroyed one can remain but they are left unsupported. Those ice blocks fall down.
Solomon spends exactly a second on each of these actions.

As the result of Solomon's actions, ice blocks' segments fall down. When an ice block falls on a fire demon, the block evaporates and the demon's strength is reduced by 1. When the demons' strength is equal to 0, the fire demon vanishes. The picture below shows how it happens. The ice block that falls on the position with no demon, breaks into lots of tiny pieces and vanishes without hurting anybody.

Help Solomon destroy all the Fire Lord's army in minimum time.","The first line contains an integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=1000).

You would like to know if the following statement is true for cards that your friend owns: ""If a card has a vowel on one side, then it has an even digit on the other side."" More specifically, a vowel is one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' or 'u', and even digit is one of '0', '2', '4', '6' or '8'.

For example, if a card has 'a' on one side, and '6' on the other side, then this statement is true for it. Also, the statement is true, for example, for a card with 'b' and '4', and for a card with 'b' and '3' (since the letter is not a vowel). The statement is false, for example, for card with 'e' and '5'. You are interested if the statement is true for all cards. In particular, if no card has a vowel, the statement is true.

This new device is equipped with specially designed artificial intelligence (AI). Employees of Pineapple did their best to postpone the release of Lastus 3000 as long as possible. Finally, they found out, that the name of the new artificial intelligence is similar to the name of the phone, that Pineapple released 200 years ago. As all rights on its name belong to Pineapple, they stand on changing the name of Gogol's artificial intelligence.

Pineapple insists, that the name of their phone occurs in the name of AI as a substring.

Iahub wants to visit each destination only once. Note that, crossing through a destination is not considered visiting, unless Iahub explicitly wants to visit it at that point. Also, after Iahub visits his last destination, he doesn't come back to kilometer 0, as he stops his trip at the last destination. 

The distance between destination located at kilometer *x* and next destination, located at kilometer *y*, is |*x*<=-<=*y*| kilometers. We call a ""route"" an order of visiting the destinations. Iahub can visit destinations in any order he wants, as long as he visits all *n* destinations and he doesn't visit a destination more than once. 

Iahub starts writing out on a paper all possible routes and for each of them, he notes the total distance he would walk. He's interested in the average number of kilometers he would walk by choosing a route. As he got bored of writing out all the routes, he asks you to help him.","The first line contains integer *n* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105).

The latter events happen to be of no importance to us. Vasya is an accountant and he loves counting money. So he wondered what maximum and minimum sum of money these passengers could have paid for the ride.

The bus fare equals one berland ruble in High Bertown. However, not everything is that easy — no more than one child can ride for free with each grown-up passenger. That means that a grown-up passenger who rides with his *k* (*k*<=&gt;<=0) children, pays overall *k* rubles: a ticket for himself and (*k*<=-<=1) tickets for his children. Also, a grown-up can ride without children, in this case he only pays one ruble.

We know that in High Bertown children can't ride in a bus unaccompanied by grown-ups.

Help Vasya count the minimum and the maximum sum in Berland rubles, that all passengers of this bus could have paid in total.","The input file consists of a single line containing two space-separated numbers *n* and *m* (0<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=105) — the number of the grown-ups and the number of the children in the bus, correspondingly.","If *n* grown-ups and *m* children could have ridden in the bus, then print on a single line two space-separated integers — the minimum and the maximum possible total bus fare, correspondingly.

1006,A,Adjacent Replacements,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Mishka got an integer array $a$ of length $n$ as a birthday present (what a surprise!).

Mishka doesn't like this present and wants to change it somehow. He has invented an algorithm and called it ""Mishka's Adjacent Replacements Algorithm"". This algorithm can be represented as a sequence of steps:
 -  Replace each occurrence of $1$ in the array $a$ with $2$; -  Replace each occurrence of $2$ in the array $a$ with $1$; -  Replace each occurrence of $3$ in the array $a$ with $4$; -  Replace each occurrence of $4$ in the array $a$ with $3$; -  Replace each occurrence of $5$ in the array $a$ with $6$; -  Replace each occurrence of $6$ in the array $a$ with $5$; -  $\dots$ -  Replace each occurrence of $10^9 - 1$ in the array $a$ with $10^9$; -  Replace each occurrence of $10^9$ in the array $a$ with $10^9 - 1$. 
Note that the dots in the middle of this algorithm mean that Mishka applies these replacements for each pair of adjacent integers ($2i - 1, 2i$) for each $i \in\{1, 2, \ldots, 5 \cdot 10^8\}$ as described above.

For example, for the array $a = [1, 2, 4, 5, 10]$, the following sequence of arrays represents the algorithm: 

$[1, 2, 4, 5, 10]$ $\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $1$ with $2$) $\rightarrow$ $[2, 2, 4, 5, 10]$ $\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $2$ with $1$) $\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 4, 5, 10]$ $\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $3$ with $4$) $\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 4, 5, 10]$ $\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $4$ with $3$) $\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $5$ with $6$) $\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 6, 10]$ $\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $6$ with $5$) $\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\rightarrow$ $\dots$ $\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $10$ with $9$) $\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 9]$.

String *x* = *x*1*x*2... *x*|*x*| is lexicographically larger than string *y* = *y*1*y*2... *y*|*y*| if either |*x*| &gt; |*y*| and *x*1<==<=*y*1, *x*2<==<=*y*2, ...,<=*x*|*y*|<==<=*y*|*y*|, or there exists such number *r* (*r*<=&lt;<=|*x*|, *r*<=&lt;<=|*y*|) that *x*1<==<=*y*1, *x*2<==<=*y*2, ..., *x**r*<==<=*y**r* and *x**r*<=<=+<=<=1<=&gt;<=*y**r*<=<=+<=<=1.

For example, if the first line of the board looks like that ""BBBBBBWW"" (the white cells of the line are marked with character ""W"", the black cells are marked with character ""B""), then after one cyclic shift it will look like that ""WBBBBBBW"".

As the lecture was boring, Vasya decided to complete the picture by composing a graph *G* with the following properties: 
 -  *G* has exactly *n* vertices, numbered from 1 to *n*. -  For all pairs of vertices *i* and *j*, where *i*<=≠<=*j*, there is an edge connecting them if and only if characters *s**i* and *s**j* are either equal or neighbouring in the alphabet. That is, letters in pairs ""a""-""b"" and ""b""-""c"" are neighbouring, while letters ""a""-""c"" are not. 
Vasya painted the resulting graph near the string and then erased the string. Next day Vasya's friend Petya came to a lecture and found some graph at his desk. He had heard of Vasya's adventure and now he wants to find out whether it could be the original graph *G*, painted by Vasya.

This new game is played on a board consisting of 8 rows and 8 columns. At the beginning of every game some black and white pawns are placed on the board. The number of black pawns placed is not necessarily equal to the number of white pawns placed. 

Lets enumerate rows and columns with integers from 1 to 8. Rows are numbered from top to bottom, while columns are numbered from left to right. Now we denote as (*r*,<=*c*) the cell located at the row *r* and at the column *c*.

There are always two players A and B playing the game. Player A plays with white pawns, while player B plays with black ones. The goal of player A is to put any of his pawns to the row 1, while player B tries to put any of his pawns to the row 8. As soon as any of the players completes his goal the game finishes immediately and the succeeded player is declared a winner.

Player A moves first and then they alternate turns. On his move player A must choose exactly one white pawn and move it one step upward and player B (at his turn) must choose exactly one black pawn and move it one step down. Any move is possible only if the targeted cell is empty. It's guaranteed that for any scenario of the game there will always be at least one move available for any of the players.

Moving upward means that the pawn located in (*r*,<=*c*) will go to the cell (*r*<=-<=1,<=*c*), while moving down means the pawn located in (*r*,<=*c*) will go to the cell (*r*<=+<=1,<=*c*). Again, the corresponding cell must be empty, i.e. not occupied by any other pawn of any color.

Given the initial disposition of the board, determine who wins the game if both players play optimally. Note that there will always be a winner due to the restriction that for any game scenario both players will have some moves available.","The input consists of the board description given in eight lines, each line contains eight characters.

The path from Moscow to Saratov can be represented as a straight line (well, it's not that straight in reality, but in this problem we will consider it to be straight), and the distance between Moscow and Saratov is $n$ km. Let's say that Moscow is situated at the point with coordinate $0$ km, and Saratov — at coordinate $n$ km.

Driving for a long time may be really difficult. Formally, if Leha has already covered $i$ kilometers since he stopped to have a rest, he considers the difficulty of covering $(i + 1)$-th kilometer as $a_{i + 1}$. It is guaranteed that for every $i \in [1, n - 1]$ $a_i \le a_{i + 1}$. The difficulty of the journey is denoted as the sum of difficulties of each kilometer in the journey.

Fortunately, there may be some rest sites between Moscow and Saratov. Every integer point from $1$ to $n - 1$ may contain a rest site. When Leha enters a rest site, he may have a rest, and the next kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the kilometer after it — difficulty $a_2$, and so on.

For example, if $n = 5$ and there is a rest site in coordinate $2$, the difficulty of journey will be $2a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3$: the first kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the second one — $a_2$, then Leha will have a rest, and the third kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the fourth — $a_2$, and the last one — $a_3$. Another example: if $n = 7$ and there are rest sites in coordinates $1$ and $5$, the difficulty of Leha's journey is $3a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3 + a_4$.

Leha doesn't know which integer points contain rest sites. So he has to consider every possible situation. Obviously, there are $2^{n - 1}$ different distributions of rest sites (two distributions are different if there exists some point $x$ such that it contains a rest site in exactly one of these distributions). Leha considers all these distributions to be equiprobable. He wants to calculate $p$ — the expected value of difficulty of his journey.

Obviously, $p \cdot 2^{n - 1}$ is an integer number. You have to calculate it modulo $998244353$.","The first line contains one number $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^6$) — the distance from Moscow to Saratov.

One day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.

In his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.

Shapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length ∞ (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.

Each of the stages is defined by a lowercase Latin letter. This way, the rocket can be described by the string — concatenation of letters, which correspond to the stages.

There are $n$ stages available. The rocket must contain exactly $k$ of them. Stages in the rocket should be ordered by their weight. So, after the stage with some letter can go only stage with a letter, which is at least two positions after in the alphabet (skipping one letter in between, or even more). For example, after letter 'c' can't go letters 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd', but can go letters 'e', 'f', ..., 'z'.

For the rocket to fly as far as possible, its weight should be minimal. The weight of the rocket is equal to the sum of the weights of its stages. The weight of the stage is the number of its letter in the alphabet. For example, the stage 'a 'weighs one ton,' b 'weighs two tons, and' z' — $26$ tons.

For example, when this cipher is applied to the sentence

Kira is childish and he hates losing

61,A,Ultra-Fast Mathematician,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Shapur was an extremely gifted student. He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.

One day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.

In his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.

Shapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length ∞ (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.

Now you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.",There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number.

""Once upon a time, there lived an emperor. He was very rich and had much grain. One day he ordered to build a huge barn to put there all his grain. Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through. Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...""

More formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of *n* grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:
 -  *m* grains are brought to the barn. If *m* grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account). -  Sparrows come and eat grain. In the *i*-th day *i* sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. 
Anton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn.

Let's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly more than 10 characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.

This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.

Thus, ""localization"" will be spelt as ""l10n"", and ""internationalization» will be spelt as ""i18n"".

Seats 'a', 'b' and 'c' are located to the left of an aisle (if one looks in the direction of the cockpit), while seats 'd', 'e' and 'f' are located to the right. Seats 'a' and 'f' are located near the windows, while seats 'c' and 'd' are located near the aisle. 

 

It's lunch time and two flight attendants have just started to serve food. They move from the first rows to the tail, always maintaining a distance of two rows from each other because of the food trolley. Thus, at the beginning the first attendant serves row 1 while the second attendant serves row 3. When both rows are done they move one row forward: the first attendant serves row 2 while the second attendant serves row 4. Then they move three rows forward and the first attendant serves row 5 while the second attendant serves row 7. Then they move one row forward again and so on.

Flight attendants work with the same speed: it takes exactly 1 second to serve one passenger and 1 second to move one row forward. Each attendant first serves the passengers on the seats to the right of the aisle and then serves passengers on the seats to the left of the aisle (if one looks in the direction of the cockpit). Moreover, they always serve passengers in order from the window to the aisle. Thus, the first passenger to receive food in each row is located in seat 'f', and the last one — in seat 'c'.

The clock's face can display any number from 1 to *d*. It is guaranteed that *a**i*<=≤<=*d* for all *i* from 1 to *n*. The clock does not keep information about the current month, so when a new day comes, it simply increases the current day number by one. The clock cannot display number *d*<=+<=1, so after day number *d* it shows day 1 (the current day counter resets). The mechanism of the clock allows you to increase the day number by one manually. When you execute this operation, day *d* is also followed by day 1.

Vasya begins each day checking the day number on the clock. If the day number on the clock does not match the actual day number in the current month, then Vasya manually increases it by one. Vasya is persistent and repeats this operation until the day number on the clock matches the actual number of the current day in the current month.

Maxim has a wallet which can be represented as an array of integers. His wallet contains $m$ bills, the $j$-th bill has value $a_j$.

Games in the shop are ordered from left to right, Maxim tries to buy every game in that order.

When Maxim stands at the position $i$ in the shop, he takes the first bill from his wallet (if his wallet is empty then he proceeds to the next position immediately) and tries to buy the $i$-th game using this bill. After Maxim tried to buy the $n$-th game, he leaves the shop.

Maxim buys the $i$-th game if and only if the value of the first bill (which he takes) from his wallet is greater or equal to the cost of the $i$-th game. If he successfully buys the $i$-th game, the first bill from his wallet disappears and the next bill becomes first. Otherwise Maxim leaves the first bill in his wallet (this bill still remains the first one) and proceeds to the next game.

For example, for array $c = [2, 4, 5, 2, 4]$ and array $a = [5, 3, 4, 6]$ the following process takes place: Maxim buys the first game using the first bill (its value is $5$), the bill disappears, after that the second bill (with value $3$) becomes the first one in Maxim's wallet, then Maxim doesn't buy the second game because $c_2 &gt; a_2$, the same with the third game, then he buys the fourth game using the bill of value $a_2$ (the third bill becomes the first one in Maxim's wallet) and buys the fifth game using the bill of value $a_3$.

The date of the Apocalypse is such correct date that the number of times it is mentioned in the Prophesy is strictly larger than that of any other correct date.

A palindromic number is another matter. It is aesthetically pleasing, and it has a number of remarkable properties. Help Rikhail to convince the scientific community in this!

Let us remind you that a number is called prime if it is integer larger than one, and is not divisible by any positive integer other than itself and one.

Rikhail calls a number a palindromic if it is integer, positive, and its decimal representation without leading zeros is a palindrome, i.e. reads the same from left to right and right to left.

One problem with prime numbers is that there are too many of them. Let's introduce the following notation: π(*n*) — the number of primes no larger than *n*, *rub*(*n*) — the number of palindromic numbers no larger than *n*. Rikhail wants to prove that there are a lot more primes than palindromic ones.

""Piece of cake"" — thought Vasya, we need only to check if the sum of all vectors is equal to 0. So, Vasya began to solve the problem. But later it turned out that there can be lots and lots of these forces, and Vasya can not cope without your help. Help him. Write a program that determines whether a body is idle or is moving by the given vectors of forces.","The first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100), then follow *n* lines containing three integers each: the *x**i* coordinate, the *y**i* coordinate and the *z**i* coordinate of the force vector, applied to the body (<=-<=100<=≤<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*,<=*z**i*<=≤<=100).","Print the word ""YES"" if the body is in equilibrium, or the word ""NO"" if it is not.","['3\n4 1 7\n-2 4 -1\n1 -5 -3\n', '3\n3 -1 7\n-5 2 -4\n2 -1 -3\n']","['NO', 'YES']",none,OK,"n = int(input())

Naturally, the bear painted the circles for a simple experiment with a fly. The experiment continued for *m*2 days. Each day of the experiment got its own unique number from 0 to *m*2<=-<=1, inclusive. 

On the day number *i* the following things happened: 
 1.  The fly arrived at the coordinate plane at the center of the circle with number  ( is the result of dividing number *x* by number *y*, rounded down to an integer). 1.  The fly went along the coordinate plane to the center of the circle number  ( is the remainder after dividing number *x* by number *y*). The bear noticed that the fly went from the center of circle *v* to the center of circle *u* along the shortest path with all points lying on the border or inside at least one of the 2*m* circles. After the fly reached the center of circle *u*, it flew away in an unknown direction.

He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.

One day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.

In his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.

Shapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length ∞ (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.

Thus, ""localization"" will be spelt as ""l10n"", and ""internationalization» will be spelt as ""i18n"".

Kuro loves walking and he is planning to take a walking marathon, in which he will choose a pair of towns $(u, v)$ ($u \neq v$) and walk from $u$ using the shortest path to $v$ (note that $(u, v)$ is considered to be different from $(v, u)$).

Oddly, there are 2 special towns in Uberland named Flowrisa (denoted with the index $x$) and Beetopia (denoted with the index $y$). Flowrisa is a town where there are many strong-scent flowers, and Beetopia is another town where many bees live. In particular, Kuro will avoid any pair of towns $(u, v)$ if on the path from $u$ to $v$, he reaches Beetopia after he reached Flowrisa, since the bees will be attracted with the flower smell on Kuro’s body and sting him.

Kuro wants to know how many pair of city $(u, v)$ he can take as his route.

Most damage those strange creatures inflicted upon the kingdom was that they loved high precision numbers. As a result, the Kingdom healers had already had three appointments with the merchants who were asked to sell, say, exactly 0.273549107 beer barrels. To deal with the problem somehow, the King issued an order obliging rounding up all numbers to the closest integer to simplify calculations. Specifically, the order went like this:
-  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is strictly less than 0.5, then the rounded up number coincides with the number’s integer part. -  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is not less than 0.5, the rounded up number is obtained if we add 1 to the last digit of the number’s integer part.-  If the number’s integer part ends with digit 9, to round up the numbers one should go to Vasilisa the Wise. In the whole Kingdom she is the only one who can perform the tricky operation of carrying into the next position.

Polycarp analyzes each of the obtained numbers and finds the number of those that are divisible by $3$.

For example, if the original number is $s=3121$, then Polycarp can cut it into three parts with two cuts: $3|1|21$. As a result, he will get two numbers that are divisible by $3$.

Also, each card earns some value in points assigned to it: cards with value from two to ten earn from 2 to 10 points, correspondingly. An ace can either earn 1 or 11, whatever the player wishes. The picture cards (king, queen and jack) earn 10 points. The number of points a card earns does not depend on the suit. The rules of the game are very simple. The player gets two cards, if the sum of points of those cards equals *n*, then the player wins, otherwise the player loses.

The player has already got the first card, it's the queen of spades. To evaluate chances for victory, you should determine how many ways there are to get the second card so that the sum of points exactly equals *n*.",The only line contains *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=25) — the required sum of points.,Print the numbers of ways to get the second card in the required way if the first card is the queen of spades.,"['12\n', '20\n', '10\n']","['4', '15', '0']","In the first sample only four two's of different suits can earn the required sum of points.

227,B,Effective Approach,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.

According to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.

Vasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.

To finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.

But the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.","The first line contains integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105) — the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the elements of array. 

The third line contains integer *m* (1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=105) — the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=≤<=*b**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.","Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs. Separate the numbers by spaces.

61,B,Hard Work,PROGRAMMING,['strings'],"After the contest in comparing numbers, Shapur's teacher found out that he is a real genius and that no one could possibly do the calculations faster than him even using a super computer!

Some days before the contest, the teacher took a very simple-looking exam and all his *n* students took part in the exam. The teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation.

Unfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.

Now the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers.

Shapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: 
 -  As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. -  As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include ""-"", "";"" and ""_"". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. -  The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600 -  My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. -  Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN -  You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong.

814,A,An abandoned sentiment from past,PROGRAMMING,"['constructive algorithms', 'greedy', 'implementation', 'sortings']","A few years ago, Hitagi encountered a giant crab, who stole the whole of her body weight. Ever since, she tried to avoid contact with others, for fear that this secret might be noticed.

To get rid of the oddity and recover her weight, a special integer sequence is needed. Hitagi's sequence has been broken for a long time, but now Kaiki provides an opportunity.

Hitagi's sequence *a* has a length of *n*. Lost elements in it are denoted by zeros. Kaiki provides another sequence *b*, whose length *k* equals the number of lost elements in *a* (i.e. the number of zeros). Hitagi is to replace each zero in *a* with an element from *b* so that each element in *b* should be used exactly once. Hitagi knows, however, that, apart from 0, no integer occurs in *a* and *b* more than once in total.

0,none,none,none,['none'],"In the spirit of the holidays, Saitama has given Genos two grid paths of length *n* (a weird gift even by Saitama's standards). A grid path is an ordered sequence of neighbouring squares in an infinite grid. Two squares are neighbouring if they share a side.

One example of a grid path is (0,<=0)<=→<=(0,<=1)<=→<=(0,<=2)<=→<=(1,<=2)<=→<=(1,<=1)<=→<=(0,<=1)<=→<=(<=-<=1,<=1). Note that squares in this sequence might be repeated, i.e. path has self intersections.

Movement within a grid path is restricted to adjacent squares within the sequence. That is, from the *i*-th square, one can only move to the (*i*<=-<=1)-th or (*i*<=+<=1)-th squares of this path. Note that there is only a single valid move from the first and last squares of a grid path. Also note, that even if there is some *j*-th square of the path that coincides with the *i*-th square, only moves to (*i*<=-<=1)-th and (*i*<=+<=1)-th squares are available. For example, from the second square in the above sequence, one can only move to either the first or third squares.

To ensure that movement is not ambiguous, the two grid paths will not have an alternating sequence of three squares. For example, a contiguous subsequence (0,<=0)<=→<=(0,<=1)<=→<=(0,<=0) cannot occur in a valid grid path.

One marble is placed on the first square of each grid path. Genos wants to get both marbles to the last square of each grid path. However, there is a catch. Whenever he moves one marble, the other marble will copy its movement if possible. For instance, if one marble moves east, then the other marble will try and move east as well. By try, we mean if moving east is a valid move, then the marble will move east.

Moving north increases the second coordinate by 1, while moving south decreases it by 1. Similarly, moving east increases first coordinate by 1, while moving west decreases it.

Given these two valid grid paths, Genos wants to know if it is possible to move both marbles to the ends of their respective paths. That is, if it is possible to move the marbles such that both marbles rest on the last square of their respective paths.","The first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=1<=000<=000) — the length of the paths.

191,A,Dynasty Puzzles,PROGRAMMING,['dp'],"The ancient Berlanders believed that the longer the name, the more important its bearer is. Thus, Berland kings were famous for their long names. But long names are somewhat inconvenient, so the Berlanders started to abbreviate the names of their kings. They called every king by the first letters of its name. Thus, the king, whose name was Victorious Vasily Pupkin, was always called by the berlanders VVP.

In Berland over its long history many dynasties of kings replaced each other, but they were all united by common traditions. Thus, according to one Berland traditions, to maintain stability in the country, the first name of the heir should be the same as the last name his predecessor (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the heir coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the predecessor). Berlanders appreciate stability, so this tradition has never been broken. Also Berlanders like perfection, so another tradition requires that the first name of the first king in the dynasty coincides with the last name of the last king in this dynasty (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the first king coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the last king). This tradition, of course, has also been always observed.

The name of a dynasty is formed by very simple rules: we take all the short names of the kings in the order in which they ruled, and write them in one line. Thus, a dynasty of kings ""ab"" and ""ba"" is called ""abba"", and the dynasty, which had only the king ""abca"", is called ""abca"".

Vasya, a historian, has recently found a list of abbreviated names of all Berland kings and their relatives. Help Vasya to find the maximally long name of the dynasty that could have existed in Berland.

Note that in his list all the names are ordered by the time, that is, if name *A* is earlier in the list than *B*, then if *A* and *B* were kings, then king *A* ruled before king *B*.","The first line contains integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=5·105) — the number of names in Vasya's list. Next *n* lines contain *n* abbreviated names, one per line. An abbreviated name is a non-empty sequence of lowercase Latin letters. Its length does not exceed 10 characters.","Print a single number — length of the sought dynasty's name in letters.

Most damage those strange creatures inflicted upon the kingdom was that they loved high precision numbers. As a result, the Kingdom healers had already had three appointments with the merchants who were asked to sell, say, exactly 0.273549107 beer barrels. To deal with the problem somehow, the King issued an order obliging rounding up all numbers to the closest integer to simplify calculations. Specifically, the order went like this:
-  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is strictly less than 0.5, then the rounded up number coincides with the number’s integer part. -  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is not less than 0.5, the rounded up number is obtained if we add 1 to the last digit of the number’s integer part.-  If the number’s integer part ends with digit 9, to round up the numbers one should go to Vasilisa the Wise.

Thus, you can go to room *x* only from room *x*<=-<=1.

The potato pie is located in the *n*-th room and Vitaly needs to go there. 

Each pair of consecutive rooms has a door between them. In order to go to room *x* from room *x*<=-<=1, you need to open the door between the rooms with the corresponding key. 

In total the house has several types of doors (represented by uppercase Latin letters) and several types of keys (represented by lowercase Latin letters). The key of type *t* can open the door of type *T* if and only if *t* and *T* are the same letter, written in different cases. For example, key f can open door F.

Each of the first *n*<=-<=1 rooms contains exactly one key of some type that Vitaly can use to get to next rooms. Once the door is open with some key, Vitaly won't get the key from the keyhole but he will immediately run into the next room. In other words, each key can open no more than one door.

Vasya can press one or two keys with one hand. However, he can only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the keys does not exceed *x*. The keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.

Vasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest ""Shift"" key is strictly larger than *x*.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

However, Vasilisa the Wise does not know what the box's secret is, since she cannot open it again. She hopes that you will help her one more time with that.

The box's lock looks as follows: it contains 4 identical deepenings for gems as a 2<=×<=2 square, and some integer numbers are written at the lock's edge near the deepenings. The example of a lock is given on the picture below.

The box is accompanied with 9 gems. Their shapes match the deepenings' shapes and each gem contains one number from 1 to 9 (each number is written on exactly one gem). The box will only open after it is decorated with gems correctly: that is, each deepening in the lock should be filled with exactly one gem. Also, the sums of numbers in the square's rows, columns and two diagonals of the square should match the numbers written at the lock's edge. For example, the above lock will open if we fill the deepenings with gems with numbers as is shown on the picture below.

Now Vasilisa the Wise wants to define, given the numbers on the box's lock, which gems she should put in the deepenings to open the box. Help Vasilisa to solve this challenging task.","The input contains numbers written on the edges of the lock of the box. The first line contains space-separated integers *r*1 and *r*2 that define the required sums of numbers in the rows of the square.

Correspondence between the above 6 variables and places where they are written is shown on the picture below.

1006,E,Military Problem,PROGRAMMING,"['dfs and similar', 'graphs', 'trees']","In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.

There are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.

Officer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:
 -  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$; -  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. 
For example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.

The structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.

Formally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.

Berland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.

To process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.

Suppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ — one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.

Let's look at the following example:

If officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.

If officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.

If officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.

If officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.

To answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.

You should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.","The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.

The second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \dots, p_n$ ($1 \le p_i &lt; i$), where $p_i$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $i$. The commander has index $1$ and doesn't have any superiors.

The next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query is given as a pair ($u_i, k_i$) ($1 \le u_i, k_i \le n$), where $u_i$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $k_i$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence.","Print $q$ numbers, where the $i$-th number is the officer at the position $k_i$ in the list which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if it starts spreading from officer $u_i$.

He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.

One day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.

In his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.

Shapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length ∞ (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.

For each news he also creates a list of hashtags to make searching for a particular topic more comfortable. For the purpose of this problem we define hashtag as a string consisting of lowercase English letters and exactly one symbol '#' located at the beginning of the string. The length of the hashtag is defined as the number of symbols in it without the symbol '#'.

The head administrator of the page told Vasya that hashtags should go in lexicographical order (take a look at the notes section for the definition).

Vasya is lazy so he doesn't want to actually change the order of hashtags in already published news. Instead, he decided to delete some suffixes (consecutive characters at the end of the string) of some of the hashtags. He is allowed to delete any number of characters, even the whole string except for the symbol '#'.

Flowrisa is a town where there are many strong-scent flowers, and Beetopia is another town where many bees live. In particular, Kuro will avoid any pair of towns $(u, v)$ if on the path from $u$ to $v$, he reaches Beetopia after he reached Flowrisa, since the bees will be attracted with the flower smell on Kuro’s body and sting him.

Maxim has a wallet which can be represented as an array of integers. His wallet contains $m$ bills, the $j$-th bill has value $a_j$.

Games in the shop are ordered from left to right, Maxim tries to buy every game in that order.

When Maxim stands at the position $i$ in the shop, he takes the first bill from his wallet (if his wallet is empty then he proceeds to the next position immediately) and tries to buy the $i$-th game using this bill. After Maxim tried to buy the $n$-th game, he leaves the shop.

Maxim buys the $i$-th game if and only if the value of the first bill (which he takes) from his wallet is greater or equal to the cost of the $i$-th game. If he successfully buys the $i$-th game, the first bill from his wallet disappears and the next bill becomes first. Otherwise Maxim leaves the first bill in his wallet (this bill still remains the first one) and proceeds to the next game.

For example, for array $c = [2, 4, 5, 2, 4]$ and array $a = [5, 3, 4, 6]$ the following process takes place: Maxim buys the first game using the first bill (its value is $5$), the bill disappears, after that the second bill (with value $3$) becomes the first one in Maxim's wallet, then Maxim doesn't buy the second game because $c_2 &gt; a_2$, the same with the third game, then he buys the fourth game using the bill of value $a_2$ (the third bill becomes the first one in Maxim's wallet) and buys the fifth game using the bill of value $a_3$.

227,B,Effective Approach,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.

According to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.

Vasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.

To finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.

But the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.","The first line contains integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105) — the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the elements of array. 

The third line contains integer *m* (1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=105) — the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=≤<=*b**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the search queries.

Their favorite occupation is to sort collections of coins. Sasha likes having things in order, that is why he wants his coins to be arranged in a row in such a way that firstly come coins out of circulation, and then come coins still in circulation. 

For arranging coins Dima uses the following algorithm. One step of his algorithm looks like the following:
 1.  He looks through all the coins from left to right; 1.  If he sees that the *i*-th coin is still in circulation, and (*i*<=+<=1)-th coin is already out of circulation, he exchanges these two coins and continues watching coins from (*i*<=+<=1)-th. 
Dima repeats the procedure above until it happens that no two coins were exchanged during this procedure. Dima calls hardness of ordering the number of steps required for him according to the algorithm above to sort the sequence, e.g. the number of times he looks through the coins from the very beginning. For example, for the ordered sequence hardness of ordering equals one.

Today Sasha invited Dima and proposed him a game. First he puts *n* coins in a row, all of them are out of circulation. Then Sasha chooses one of the coins out of circulation and replaces it with a coin in circulation for *n* times. During this process Sasha constantly asks Dima what is the hardness of ordering of the sequence. 

The task is more complicated because Dima should not touch the coins and he should determine hardness of ordering in his mind. Help Dima with this task.","The first line contains single integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=300<=000) — number of coins that Sasha puts behind Dima.

Second line contains *n* distinct integers *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n* (1<=≤<=*p**i*<=≤<=*n*) — positions that Sasha puts coins in circulation to. At first Sasha replaces coin located at position *p*1, then coin located at position *p*2 and so on. Coins are numbered from left to right.","Print *n*<=+<=1 numbers *a*0,<=*a*1,<=...,<=*a**n*, where *a*0 is a hardness of ordering at the beginning, *a*1 is a hardness of ordering after the first replacement and so on.","['4\n1 3 4 2\n', '8\n6 8 3 4 7 2 1 5\n']","['1 2 3 2 1\n', '1 2 2 3 4 3 4 5 1\n']","Let's denote as O coin out of circulation, and as X — coin is circulation.

At the first sample, initially in row there are coins that are not in circulation, so Dima will look through them from left to right and won't make any exchanges.

After replacement of the first coin with a coin in circulation, Dima will exchange this coin with next three times and after that he will finally look through the coins and finish the process.

After replacement of the third coin, Dima's actions look this way:

One day Vasya decided to collect the results of all contests where his favorite coder participated and track the progress of his coolness.

First, it is amazing if during the contest the coder earns strictly more points that he earned on each past contest. Second, it is amazing if during the contest the coder earns strictly less points that he earned on each past contest. A coder's first contest isn't considered amazing.

Ever since, she tried to avoid contact with others, for fear that this secret might be noticed.

To get rid of the oddity and recover her weight, a special integer sequence is needed. Hitagi's sequence has been broken for a long time, but now Kaiki provides an opportunity.

Hitagi's sequence *a* has a length of *n*. Lost elements in it are denoted by zeros. Kaiki provides another sequence *b*, whose length *k* equals the number of lost elements in *a* (i.e. the number of zeros). Hitagi is to replace each zero in *a* with an element from *b* so that each element in *b* should be used exactly once. Hitagi knows, however, that, apart from 0, no integer occurs in *a* and *b* more than once in total.

If the resulting sequence is not an increasing sequence, then it has the power to recover Hitagi from the oddity. You are to determine whether this is possible, or Kaiki's sequence is just another fake. In other words, you should detect whether it is possible to replace each zero in *a* with an integer from *b* so that each integer from *b* is used exactly once, and the resulting sequence is not increasing.","The first line of input contains two space-separated positive integers *n* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100) and *k* (1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=*n*) — the lengths of sequence *a* and *b* respectively.

The third line contains *k* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**k* (1<=≤<=*b**i*<=≤<=200) — the elements to fill into Hitagi's sequence.

One day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.

In his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.

Shapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length ∞ (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too.

61,A,Ultra-Fast Mathematician,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Shapur was an extremely gifted student. He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.

One day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.

In his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.

Shapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length ∞ (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.

Now you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.",There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number.

Now let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.

As you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. ""But why split the money equally?"" — you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins.

1000,B,Light It Up,PROGRAMMING,['greedy'],"Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are ""lights on"" and ""lights off""). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.

The lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.

The lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.

Since you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.

Find such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.","First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$, $2 \le M \le 10^9$) — the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.

Second line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) — initially installed program $a$.",Print the only integer — maximum possible total time when the lamp is lit.,"['3 10\n4 6 7\n', '2 12\n1 10\n', '2 7\n3 4\n']","['8\n', '9\n', '6\n']","In the first example, one of possible optimal solutions is to insert value $x = 3$ before $a_1$, so program will be $[3, 4, 6, 7]$ and time of lamp being lit equals $(3 - 0) + (6 - 4) + (10 - 7) = 8$. Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.

In the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.

It is a pity that Petya forgot the order in which the remainders should be taken and wrote down only 4 numbers. Each of 24 possible orders of taking the remainder has equal probability of being chosen. For example, if Petya has numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 then he can take remainders in that order or first take remainder modulo 4, then modulo 2, 3, 1. There also are 22 other permutations of these numbers that represent orders in which remainder can be taken. In this problem 4 numbers wrote down by Petya will be pairwise distinct.

Now it is impossible for Petya to complete the task given by teacher but just for fun he decided to find the number of integers  with property that probability that *f*(*x*)<==<=*x* is not less than 31.4159265352718281828459045%.

The main character of this game has *n* different skills, each of which is characterized by an integer *a**i* from 0 to 100. The higher the number *a**i* is, the higher is the *i*-th skill of the character. The total rating of the character is calculated as the sum of the values ​​of  for all *i* from 1 to *n*. The expression ⌊ *x*⌋ denotes the result of rounding the number *x* down to the nearest integer.

At the beginning of the game Petya got *k* improvement units as a bonus that he can use to increase the skills of his character and his total rating. One improvement unit can increase any skill of Petya's character by exactly one. For example, if *a*4<==<=46, after using one imporvement unit to this skill, it becomes equal to 47. A hero's skill cannot rise higher more than 100. Thus, it is permissible that some of the units will remain unused.

In the second test the optimal strategy for Petya is to improve the first skill to 20 (by spending 3 improvement units) and to improve the third skill to 20 (in this case by spending 1 improvement units). Thus, Petya is left with 4 improvement units and he will be able to increase the second skill to 19 (which does not change the overall rating, so Petya does not necessarily have to do it).

Let A-B denote that members A and B are friends. Limak thinks that a network is reasonable if and only if the following condition is satisfied: For every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z then also X-Z.

For example: if Alan and Bob are friends, and Bob and Ciri are friends, then Alan and Ciri should be friends as well.

However, Vasilisa the Wise does not know what the box's secret is, since she cannot open it again. She hopes that you will help her one more time with that.

The box's lock looks as follows: it contains 4 identical deepenings for gems as a 2<=×<=2 square, and some integer numbers are written at the lock's edge near the deepenings. The example of a lock is given on the picture below.

The box is accompanied with 9 gems. Their shapes match the deepenings' shapes and each gem contains one number from 1 to 9 (each number is written on exactly one gem). The box will only open after it is decorated with gems correctly: that is, each deepening in the lock should be filled with exactly one gem. Also, the sums of numbers in the square's rows, columns and two diagonals of the square should match the numbers written at the lock's edge. For example, the above lock will open if we fill the deepenings with gems with numbers as is shown on the picture below.

Like all the sharks, she has several rows of teeth, and feeds on crucians. One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are ""relaxing"".

For a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap).

It turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again. 

Unhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her. For sure, the shark couldn't say no to her favourite meal, but she had no desire to go back to the dentist. That's why she decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that the viability of no tooth becomes negative. 

As Valerie is not good at mathematics, she asked you to help her to find out the total amount of crucians that she can consume for dinner.

We should remind you that while eating one crucian Valerie uses exactly one row of teeth and the viability of each tooth from this row decreases by one.","The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=1000,<=0<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=106) — total amount of Valerie's teeth, amount of tooth rows and amount of crucians in Valerie's portion for dinner. Then follow *n* lines, each containing two integers: *r* (1<=≤<=*r*<=≤<=*m*) — index of the row, where belongs the corresponding tooth, and *c* (0<=≤<=*c*<=≤<=106) — its residual viability.

Initially we place a single slime in a row by itself. Thus, row is initially 1.

Then, we will add another slime. The row is now 1 1. Since two rightmost slimes have the same values, we should replace these slimes with one with value 2. Thus, the final state of the board is 2.

In the third sample, after adding the first two slimes, our row is 2. After adding one more slime, the row becomes 2 1.

In the last sample, the steps look as follows:
