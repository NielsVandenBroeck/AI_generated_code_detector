604,A,Uncowed Forces,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Kevin Sun has just finished competing in Codeforces Round #334! The round was 120 minutes long and featured five problems with maximum point values of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500, respectively. Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.

Codeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is *x*, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute *m* but made *w* wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is . His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.

All arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.","The first line of the input contains five space-separated integers *m*1, *m*2, *m*3, *m*4, *m*5, where *m**i* (0<=≤<=*m**i*<=≤<=119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem *i*. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted.

The second line contains five space-separated integers *w*1, *w*2, *w*3, *w*4, *w*5, where *w**i* (0<=≤<=*w**i*<=≤<=10) is Kevin's number of wrong submissions on problem *i*.

The last line contains two space-separated integers *h**s* and *h**u* (0<=≤<=*h**s*,<=*h**u*<=≤<=20), denoting the Kevin's numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively.","Print a single integer, the value of Kevin's final score.","['20 40 60 80 100\n0 1 2 3 4\n1 0\n', '119 119 119 119 119\n0 0 0 0 0\n10 0\n']","['4900\n', '4930\n']","In the second sample, Kevin takes 119 minutes on all of the problems.

Zahar has *n* stones which are rectangular parallelepipeds. The edges sizes of the *i*-th of them are *a**i*, *b**i* and *c**i*. He can take no more than two stones and present them to Kostya. 

If Zahar takes two stones, he should glue them together on one of the faces in order to get a new piece of rectangular parallelepiped of marble. Thus, it is possible to glue a pair of stones together if and only if two faces on which they are glued together match as rectangles. In such gluing it is allowed to rotate and flip the stones in any way.

You need to find for each query the sum of elements of the array with indexes from $l_i$ to $r_i$, inclusive.

Sasha and Kolya's Coke mixing problem.

We are given a desired carbon dioxide concentration (target) and k types of Coke,
each with its own concentration. We want to mix an integer number of liters from each type
to obtain a mixture with exactly the target concentration while minimizing the total volume.
The concentration of the mixture is defined as the total CO2 volume divided by total liters.
Mixing is linear so that the equation becomes:

    sum(x_i * a_i) / (sum(x_i)) = target

This can be rearranged (assuming sum(x_i) > 0) to:

    sum(x_i * (a_i - target)) = 0

Let’s define:
  • For a type with a_i > target: coin value = a_i - target (excess CO2).
  • For a type with a_i < target: coin value = target - a_i (deficit of CO2).

We want to choose a positive number of liters from some types with a_i > target and
some types with a_i < target (if available) so that the total excess equals the total deficit.
That is, we want to find a positive integer S such that:
    sum_{i in positives} (a_i - target) * x_i = S   and
    sum_{j in negatives} (target - a_j) * y_j = S
with integer nonnegative coefficients and at least one coin from each side.
Then the total number of liters is (sum(x_i) + sum(y_j)), and we wish to minimize that.

A trivial solution exists if there is a Coke type with concentration exactly equal to target,
in which case one liter is enough.

We solve the coin‐change problem on both sides (with coins up to a computed limit) via BFS.
We set the upper limit to the least common multiple (LCM) of the smallest coin from each set;
using only these coins gives a candidate balance value S.
Finally, we iterate over all S in [1, limit] for which both coin sets can achieve sum S,
and choose the minimal total coin count.

We need to choose n-1 roads (edges) that connect all cities [1..n]
such that the distance from the capital 1 to every city is the shortest possible,
i.e. d[v] is the BFS distance from city1 in the chosen spanning tree.
Any spanning tree that “respects” the condition for every vertex v (v!=1)
must use an edge (u,v) with dist[u] + 1 == dist[v] (or vice‐versa).
For every city v (except 1) we collect candidate edges that come from a neighbor with distance exactly one less.
Then the valid spanning trees are exactly those in which for each v (2 ≤ v ≤ n)
one of these candidate edges is chosen.
The number of possibilities is the product of choices for each v.
We only need to output k distinct valid spanning trees (or all if fewer are available).
To avoid exponential enumeration we “fix” the vertices that have a unique candidate,
and only “enumerate” over the free vertices (those with more than one candidate).
We then use a mixed‑radix enumeration (with a DP array to keep track of the number of combinations)
so that we can generate the first k valid solutions.

Wanting to join the craze, she has immediately bought the strange contraption.

Spinners in Sweetland have the form of V-shaped pieces of caramel. Each spinner can, well, spin around an invisible magic axis. At a specific point in time, a spinner can take 4 positions shown below (each one rotated 90 degrees relative to the previous, with the fourth one followed by the first one):

After the spinner was spun, it starts its rotation, which is described by a following algorithm: the spinner maintains its position for a second then majestically switches to the next position in clockwise or counter-clockwise order, depending on the direction the spinner was spun in.

Slastyona managed to have spinner rotating for exactly *n* seconds. Being fascinated by elegance of the process, she completely forgot the direction the spinner was spun in! Lucky for her, she managed to recall the starting position, and wants to deduct the direction given the information she knows. Help her do this.","There are two characters in the first string – the starting and the ending position of a spinner. The position is encoded with one of the following characters: v (ASCII code 118, lowercase v), &lt; (ASCII code 60), ^ (ASCII code 94) or &gt; (ASCII code 62) (see the picture above for reference). Characters are separated by a single space.

In the second strings, a single number *n* is given (0<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=109) – the duration of the rotation.

It is guaranteed that the ending position of a spinner is a result of a *n* second spin in any of the directions, assuming the given starting position.","Output cw, if the direction is clockwise, ccw – if counter-clockwise, and undefined otherwise.","['^ &gt;\n1\n', '&lt; ^\n3\n', '^ v\n6\n']","['cw\n', 'ccw\n', 'undefined\n']",none,RUNTIME_ERROR,"c=['^','<','v','>']

With his old computer Ivan had to choose the worst possible graphic settings (because otherwise the framerate would be really low), but now he wants to check, maybe his new computer can perform well even with the best possible graphics?

There are *m* graphics parameters in the game. *i*-th parameter can be set to any positive integer from 1 to *a**i*, and initially is set to *b**i* (*b**i*<=≤<=*a**i*). So there are  different combinations of parameters. Ivan can increase or decrease any of these parameters by 1; after that the game will be restarted with new parameters (and Ivan will have the opportunity to check chosen combination of parameters).

Ivan wants to try all *p* possible combinations. Also he wants to return to the initial settings after trying all combinations, because he thinks that initial settings can be somehow best suited for his hardware. But Ivan doesn't really want to make a lot of restarts.

So he wants you to tell the following:
 -  If there exists a way to make exactly *p* changes (each change either decreases or increases some parameter by 1) to try all possible combinations and return to initial combination, then Ivan wants to know this way. -  Otherwise, if there exists a way to make exactly *p*<=-<=1 changes to try all possible combinations (including the initial one), then Ivan wants to know this way.

First the first child throws the ball to the next one clockwise, i.e. to the child number 2.

It should be mentioned that when a ball is thrown it may pass the beginning of the circle. For example, if *n*<==<=5, then after the third throw the child number 2 has the ball again. Overall, *n*<=-<=1 throws are made, and the game ends.

The problem is that not all the children get the ball during the game. If a child doesn't get the ball, he gets very upset and cries until Natalia Pavlovna gives him a candy.

In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).

    # a breeder at cell b can intercept you if and only if the shortest distance from
    # b to E (edist[b]) is <= min_steps.

    # contain breeders) of the breeder count if that cell has edist <= min_steps.

""""""
We solve the problem by “pushing” coins (the values at positions)
to the right in a greedy manner. The optimal strategy (which was 
proved in the original editorial) is to process positions 1..n−1 
in order (using 1–indexed notation) and for each position i, “clear”
its coins with moves. In one move a coin from position i is transferred 
to position j = i + 2 · ⎣(n−i)/2⎦; note that if i is “close” to n then 
this jump might be very short – and coins which never reach a “safe”
zone cost extra moves.
 
Accordingly, we maintain an “extra” array that holds coins transferred 
from earlier positions but not yet “cleared”. Then if we denote by ans[k]
the minimum moves needed to clear positions 1 … k, one may show that
 
  ans[i] = ans[i−1] + (a[i] + extra[i]),
  and then we “push” the current coins from position i to position 
  j = i + 2 * ⎣(n − i)/2⎦ (if j ≤ n).
 
This greedy algorithm – originally published in C++ – yields the minimal 
number of moves. (See the editorial for “The Smart Beaver’s Educational Game”.)
 
The code below implements the same idea in Python. Input is read from standard 
input and output is written to standard output. (We use 0-indexing internally; 
the transformation from the 1-indexed description is done in the comments.)
 
Note: This solution produces exactly the required output: it prints n–1 lines, 
with the kth line (k = 1 … n–1) giving the answer for clearing positions 1 … k.

He has already composed major part of the anthem and now just needs to fill in some letters. King asked you to help him with this work.

The anthem is the string *s* of no more than 105 small Latin letters and question marks. The most glorious victory is the string *t* of no more than 105 small Latin letters. You should replace all the question marks with small Latin letters in such a way that the number of occurrences of string *t* in string *s* is maximal.

Since Jaggy became the ruler of the forest, he has been trying his best to improve the diplomatic relations between the forest region and the nearby ones. 

Some other rulers, however, have requested too much in return for peace between their two regions, so he realized he has to resort to intimidation. Once a delegate for diplomatic relations of a neighboring region visits Jaggy’s forest, if they see a whole bunch of black boars, they might suddenly change their mind about attacking Jaggy. Black boars are really scary, after all. 

Jaggy’s forest can be represented as a tree (connected graph without cycles) with *n* vertices. Each vertex represents a boar and is colored either black or pink. Jaggy has sent a squirrel to travel through the forest and paint all the boars black. The squirrel, however, is quite unusually trained and while it traverses the graph, it changes the color of every vertex it visits, regardless of its initial color: pink vertices become black and black vertices become pink. 

Since Jaggy is too busy to plan the squirrel’s route, he needs your help. He wants you to construct a walk through the tree starting from vertex 1 such that in the end all vertices are black. A walk is a sequence of vertices, such that every consecutive pair has an edge between them in a tree.","The first line of input contains integer *n* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=200<=000), denoting the number of vertices in the tree.

Each of the next *n*<=-<=1 lines contains two integers, which represent the indexes of the vertices which are connected by the edge. Vertices are numbered starting with 1.","Output path of a squirrel: output a sequence of visited nodes' indexes in order of visiting. In case of all the nodes are initially black, you should print 1.

681,C,Heap Operations,PROGRAMMING,"['constructive algorithms', 'data structures', 'greedy']","Petya has recently learned data structure named ""Binary heap"".

The heap he is now operating with allows the following operations: 
 -  put the given number into the heap; -  get the value of the minimum element in the heap; -  extract the minimum element from the heap; 
Thus, at any moment of time the heap contains several integers (possibly none), some of them might be equal.

In order to better learn this data structure Petya took an empty heap and applied some operations above to it. Also, he carefully wrote down all the operations and their results to his event log, following the format: 
 -  insert *x* — put the element with value *x* in the heap; -  getMin *x* — the value of the minimum element contained in the heap was equal to *x*; -  removeMin — the minimum element was extracted from the heap (only one instance, if there were many). 
All the operations were correct, i.e. there was at least one element in the heap each time getMin or removeMin operations were applied.

While Petya was away for a lunch, his little brother Vova came to the room, took away some of the pages from Petya's log and used them to make paper boats.

Now Vova is worried, if he made Petya's sequence of operations inconsistent. For example, if one apply operations one-by-one in the order they are written in the event log, results of getMin operations might differ from the results recorded by Petya, and some of getMin or removeMin operations may be incorrect, as the heap is empty at the moment they are applied.

Now Vova wants to add some new operation records to the event log in order to make the resulting sequence of operations correct. That is, the result of each getMin operation is equal to the result in the record, and the heap is non-empty when getMin ad removeMin are applied. Vova wants to complete this as fast as possible, as the Petya may get back at any moment. He asks you to add the least possible number of operation records to the current log. Note that arbitrary number of operations may be added at the beginning, between any two other operations, or at the end of the log.","The first line of the input contains the only integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100<=000) — the number of the records left in Petya's journal.

Each of the following *n* lines describe the records in the current log in the order they are applied. Format described in the statement is used. All numbers in the input are integers not exceeding 109 by their absolute value.","The first line of the output should contain a single integer *m* — the minimum possible number of records in the modified sequence of operations.

Next *m* lines should contain the corrected sequence of records following the format of the input (described in the statement), one per line and in the order they are applied. All the numbers in the output should be integers not exceeding 109 by their absolute value.

Note that the input sequence of operations must be the subsequence of the output sequence.

It's guaranteed that there exists the correct answer consisting of no more than 1<=000<=000 operations.","['2\ninsert 3\ngetMin 4\n', '4\ninsert 1\ninsert 1\nremoveMin\ngetMin 2\n']","['4\ninsert 3\nremoveMin\ninsert 4\ngetMin 4\n', '6\ninsert 1\ninsert 1\nremoveMin\nremoveMin\ninsert 2\ngetMin 2\n']","In the first sample, after number 3 is inserted into the heap, the minimum number is 3.

It states that if two people wish to fairly share a slice of pie, one person should cut the slice in half, and the other person should choose who gets which slice. Alice and Bob have many slices of pie, and rather than cutting the slices in half, each individual slice will be eaten by just one person.

The way Alice and Bob decide who eats each slice is as follows. First, the order in which the pies are to be handed out is decided. There is a special token called the ""decider"" token, initially held by Bob. Until all the pie is handed out, whoever has the decider token will give the next slice of pie to one of the participants, and the decider token to the other participant. They continue until no slices of pie are left.

All of the slices are of excellent quality, so each participant obviously wants to maximize the total amount of pie they get to eat. Assuming both players make their decisions optimally, how much pie will each participant receive?","Input will begin with an integer *N* (1<=≤<=*N*<=≤<=50), the number of slices of pie.

Mishka's Christmas tree decoration problem.
He has three garlands with periods k1, k2 and k3.
When a garland is switched on at time x, it lights at seconds:
x, x+k, x+2*k, … 
We want to choose switch‐on moments x1,x2,x3 so that starting from
t = max(x1,x2,x3) every second at least one garland is lit.
This is equivalent to finding three residue classes
r1 (mod k1), r2 (mod k2) and r3 (mod k3)
whose union (as a periodic set) covers all integers.
It turns out that if we “optimize” the choice to avoid overlaps,
the maximum number of residues we can cover modulo (k1*k2*k3)
is given by:
    T = (k2*k3 + k1*k3 + k1*k2)
        - [I(gcd(k1,k2)==1)*k3 + I(gcd(k1,k3)==1)*k2 + I(gcd(k2,k3)==1)*k1]
        + (1 if gcd(k1,k2)==gcd(k1,k3)==gcd(k2,k3)==1 else 0)
A covering exists if and only if T equals k1*k2*k3.

757,D,Felicity's Big Secret Revealed,PROGRAMMING,"['bitmasks', 'dp']","The gym leaders were fascinated by the evolutions which took place at Felicity camp. So, they were curious to know about the secret behind evolving Pokemon. 

The organizers of the camp gave the gym leaders a PokeBlock, a sequence of *n* ingredients. Each ingredient can be of type 0 or 1. Now the organizers told the gym leaders that to evolve a Pokemon of type *k* (*k*<=≥<=2), they need to make a valid set of *k* cuts on the PokeBlock to get smaller blocks.

Suppose the given PokeBlock sequence is *b*0*b*1*b*2... *b**n*<=-<=1. You have a choice of making cuts at *n*<=+<=1 places, i.e., Before *b*0, between *b*0 and *b*1, between *b*1 and *b*2, ..., between *b**n*<=-<=2 and *b**n*<=-<=1, and after *b**n*<=-<=1.

The *n*<=+<=1 choices of making cuts are as follows (where a | denotes a possible cut):

Consider a sequence of *k* cuts. Now each pair of consecutive cuts will contain a binary string between them, formed from the ingredient types. The ingredients before the first cut and after the last cut are wasted, which is to say they are not considered. So there will be exactly *k*<=-<=1 such binary substrings. Every substring can be read as a binary number. Let *m* be the maximum number out of the obtained numbers. If all the obtained numbers are positive and the set of the obtained numbers contains all integers from 1 to *m*, then this set of cuts is said to be a valid set of cuts.

For example, suppose the given PokeBlock sequence is 101101001110 and we made 5 cuts in the following way:

So the 4 binary substrings obtained are: 11, 010, 01 and 1, which correspond to the numbers 3, 2, 1 and 1 respectively. Here *m*<==<=3, as it is the maximum value among the obtained numbers. And all the obtained numbers are positive and we have obtained all integers from 1 to *m*. Hence this set of cuts is a valid set of 5 cuts.

A Pokemon of type *k* will evolve only if the PokeBlock is cut using a valid set of *k* cuts. There can be many valid sets of the same size. Two valid sets of *k* cuts are considered different if there is a cut in one set which is not there in the other set.

Let *f*(*k*) denote the number of valid sets of *k* cuts. Find the value of . Since the value of *s* can be very large, output *s* modulo 109<=+<=7.","The input consists of two lines. The first line consists an integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=75) — the length of the PokeBlock. The next line contains the PokeBlock, a binary string of length *n*.","Output a single integer, containing the answer to the problem, i.e., the value of *s* modulo 109<=+<=7.","['4\n1011\n', '2\n10\n']","['10\n', '1\n']","In the first sample, the sets of valid cuts are:

Size 2: |1|011, 1|01|1, 10|1|1, 101|1|.

Size 3: |1|01|1, |10|1|1, 10|1|1|, 1|01|1|.

Size 4: |10|1|1|, |1|01|1|.

Hence, *f*(2) = 4, *f*(3) = 4 and *f*(4) = 2. So, the value of *s* = 10.

In the second sample, the set of valid cuts is:

A tree is a connected acyclic graph. A bipartite graph is a graph, whose vertices can be partitioned into 2 sets in such a way, that for each edge (*u*,<=*v*) that belongs to the graph, *u* and *v* belong to different sets. You can find more formal definitions of a tree and a bipartite graph in the notes section below.

Dr. Evil gave Mahmoud and Ehab a tree consisting of *n* nodes and asked them to add edges to it in such a way, that the graph is still bipartite. Besides, after adding these edges the graph should be simple (doesn't contain loops or multiple edges). What is the maximum number of edges they can add?

Each edge of the graph is weighted, each weight is a positive integer.

The next day, ZS the Coder realized that some of the weights were erased! So he wants to reassign positive integer weight to each of the edges which weights were erased, so that the length of the shortest path between vertices *s* and *t* in the resulting graph is exactly *L*. Can you help him?","The first line contains five integers *n*,<=*m*,<=*L*,<=*s*,<=*t* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=1000,<=<=1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=10<=000,<=<=1<=≤<=*L*<=≤<=109,<=<=0<=≤<=*s*,<=*t*<=≤<=*n*<=-<=1,<=<=*s*<=≠<=*t*) — the number of vertices, number of edges, the desired length of shortest path, starting vertex and ending vertex respectively.

Then, *m* lines describing the edges of the graph follow. *i*-th of them contains three integers, *u**i*,<=*v**i*,<=*w**i* (0<=≤<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=≤<=*n*<=-<=1,<=<=*u**i*<=≠<=*v**i*,<=<=0<=≤<=*w**i*<=≤<=109). *u**i* and *v**i* denote the endpoints of the edge and *w**i* denotes its weight. If *w**i* is equal to 0 then the weight of the corresponding edge was erased.

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.","Print ""NO"" (without quotes) in the only line if it's not possible to assign the weights in a required way.

Otherwise, print ""YES"" in the first line. Next *m* lines should contain the edges of the resulting graph, with weights assigned to edges which weights were erased. *i*-th of them should contain three integers *u**i*, *v**i* and *w**i*, denoting an edge between vertices *u**i* and *v**i* of weight *w**i*. The edges of the new graph must coincide with the ones in the graph from the input. The weights that were not erased must remain unchanged whereas the new weights can be any positive integer not exceeding 1018. 

The order of the edges in the output doesn't matter. The length of the shortest path between *s* and *t* must be equal to *L*.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.","['5 5 13 0 4\n0 1 5\n2 1 2\n3 2 3\n1 4 0\n4 3 4\n', '2 1 123456789 0 1\n0 1 0\n', '2 1 999999999 1 0\n0 1 1000000000\n']","['YES\n0 1 5\n2 1 2\n3 2 3\n1 4 8\n4 3 4\n', 'YES\n0 1 123456789\n', 'NO\n']","Here's how the graph in the first sample case looks like :

The term is coming to an end and students start thinking about their grades. Today, a professor told his students that the grades for his course would be given out automatically  — he would calculate the simple average (arithmetic mean) of all grades given out for lab works this term and round to the nearest integer. The rounding would be done in favour of the student — $4.5$ would be rounded up to $5$ (as in example 3), but $4.4$ would be rounded down to $4$.

This does not bode well for Vasya who didn't think those lab works would influence anything, so he may receive a grade worse than $5$ (maybe even the dreaded $2$). However, the professor allowed him to redo some of his works of Vasya's choosing to increase his average grade. Vasya wants to redo as as few lab works as possible in order to get $5$ for the course. Of course, Vasya will get $5$ for the lab works he chooses to redo.

743,E,Vladik and cards,PROGRAMMING,"['binary search', 'bitmasks', 'brute force', 'dp']","Vladik was bored on his way home and decided to play the following game. He took *n* cards and put them in a row in front of himself. Every card has a positive integer number not exceeding 8 written on it. He decided to find the longest subsequence of cards which satisfies the following conditions:
 -  the number of occurrences of each number from 1 to 8 in the subsequence doesn't differ by more then 1 from the number of occurrences of any other number. Formally, if there are *c**k* cards with number *k* on them in the subsequence, than for all pairs of integers  the condition |*c**i*<=-<=*c**j*|<=≤<=1 must hold. -  if there is at least one card with number *x* on it in the subsequence, then all cards with number *x* in this subsequence must form a continuous segment in it (but not necessarily a continuous segment in the original sequence).

182,E,Wooden Fence,PROGRAMMING,['dp'],"Vasya has recently bought some land and decided to surround it with a wooden fence.

He went to a company called ""Wooden board"" that produces wooden boards for fences. Vasya read in the catalog of products that the company has at its disposal *n* different types of wood. The company uses the *i*-th type of wood to produce a board of this type that is a rectangular *a**i* by *b**i* block.

Vasya decided to order boards in this company and build a fence from them. It turned out that the storehouse of the company is so large that Vasya can order arbitrary number of boards of every type. Note that Vasya is allowed to turn the boards as he builds the fence. However, Vasya cannot turn square boards.

Vasya is required to construct a fence of length *l*, however, an arbitrary fence won't do. Vasya wants his fence to look beautiful. We'll say that a fence is beautiful if and only if the following two conditions are fulfilled:
 -  there are no two successive boards of the same type -  the first board of the fence has an arbitrary length, and the length of each subsequent board equals the width of the previous one 
In other words, the fence is considered beautiful, if the type of the *i*-th board in the fence is different from the *i*<=-<=1-th board's type; besides, the *i*-th board's length is equal to the *i*<=-<=1-th board's width (for all *i*, starting from 2).

Now Vasya wonders, how many variants of arranging a fence for his land exist. Your task is to count the number of different beautiful fences of length *l*.

Two fences will be considered the same if the corresponding sequences of fence boards types and rotations are the same, otherwise the fences are different. Since the sought number can be large enough, you need to calculate the answer modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).","The first line contains two integers *n* and *l* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100,<=1<=≤<=*l*<=≤<=3000) — the number of different board types and the fence length, correspondingly. Next *n* lines contain descriptions of board types: the *i*-th line contains two integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=≤<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=≤<=100) — the sizes of the board of the *i*-th type.

If we split string *a* into two halves of the same size *a*1 and *a*2, and string *b* into two halves of the same size *b*1 and *b*2, then one of the following is correct:   *a*1 is equivalent to *b*1, and *a*2 is equivalent to *b*2 1.  *a*1 is equivalent to *b*2, and *a*2 is equivalent to *b*1

The fillers have maximal size, for example, for ogogoo speech we can't consider ogo a filler and goo as a normal phrase. We should consider ogogo as a filler here.

To print the interview, Polycarp has to replace each of the fillers with three asterisks. Note that a filler word is replaced with exactly three asterisks regardless of its length.

Polycarp faced the following problem. There are *n* files in a directory and he needs to delete some of them. Polycarp wants to run a single delete command with filename pattern as an argument. All the files to be deleted should match the pattern and all other files shouldn't match the pattern.

Polycarp doesn't know about an asterisk '*', the only special character he knows is a question mark '?' which matches any single character. All other characters in the pattern match themselves only.

Formally, a pattern matches a filename if and only if they have equal lengths and all characters in the corresponding positions are equal except when the character in the pattern is '?', in which case the corresponding filename character does not matter.

For example, the filename pattern ""a?ba?"":
 -  matches filenames ""aabaa"", ""abba."", ""a.ba9"" and ""a.ba.""; -  does not match filenames ""aaba"", ""abaab"", ""aabaaa"" and ""aabaa."". 
Help Polycarp find a pattern which matches files to be deleted and only them or report if there is no such pattern.","The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100) — the total number of files and the number of files to be deleted.

The last line of the input contains *m* distinct integer numbers in ascending order *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**m* (1<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=*n*) — indices of files to be deleted.

For example, during yesterday sitting the Berland Parliament approved as much as *n* laws (each law has been assigned a unique number from 1 to *n*). Today all these laws were put on the table of the President of Berland, G.W. Boosch, to be signed.

This time mr. Boosch plans to sign 2*k* laws. He decided to choose exactly two non-intersecting segments of integers from 1 to *n* of length *k* and sign all laws, whose numbers fall into these segments. More formally, mr. Boosch is going to choose two integers *a*, *b* (1<=≤<=*a*<=≤<=*b*<=≤<=*n*<=-<=*k*<=+<=1,<=*b*<=-<=*a*<=≥<=*k*) and sign all laws with numbers lying in the segments [*a*; *a*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] and [*b*; *b*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] (borders are included).

As mr. Boosch chooses the laws to sign, he of course considers the public opinion. Allberland Public Opinion Study Centre (APOSC) conducted opinion polls among the citizens, processed the results into a report and gave it to the president. The report contains the absurdity value for each law, in the public opinion. As mr. Boosch is a real patriot, he is keen on signing the laws with the maximum total absurdity. Help him.","The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=2·105, 0<=&lt;<=2*k*<=≤<=*n*) — the number of laws accepted by the parliament and the length of one segment in the law list, correspondingly. The next line contains *n* integers *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n* — the absurdity of each law (1<=≤<=*x**i*<=≤<=109).","Print two integers *a*, *b* — the beginning of segments that mr. Boosch should choose. That means that the president signs laws with numbers from segments [*a*; *a*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] and [*b*; *b*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1].

The number of integers represents how many groups of black squares there are in corresponding row or column, and the integers themselves represents the number of consecutive black squares in corresponding group (you can find more detailed explanation in Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_crossword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_crossword)).

Adaltik decided that the general case of japanese crossword is too complicated and drew a row consisting of *n* squares (e.g. japanese crossword sized 1<=×<=*n*), which he wants to encrypt in the same way as in japanese crossword.

Help Adaltik find the numbers encrypting the row he drew.","The first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100) — the length of the row. The second line of the input contains a single string consisting of *n* characters 'B' or 'W', ('B' corresponds to black square, 'W' — to white square in the row that Adaltik drew).","The first line should contain a single integer *k* — the number of integers encrypting the row, e.g. the number of groups of black squares in the row.

The second line should contain *k* integers, encrypting the row, e.g. corresponding to sizes of groups of consecutive black squares in the order from left to right.","['3\nBBW\n', '5\nBWBWB\n', '4\nWWWW\n', '4\nBBBB\n', '13\nWBBBBWWBWBBBW\n']","['1\n2 ', '3\n1 1 1 ', '0\n', '1\n4 ', '3\n4 1 3 ']",The last sample case correspond to the picture in the statement.,OK,"def Remove(s):

As we know from the previous problem, the nervous system of a zombie consists of *n* brains and *m* brain connectors joining some pairs of brains together. It was observed that the intellectual abilities of a zombie depend mainly on the topology of its nervous system. More precisely, we define the distance between two brains *u* and *v* (1<=≤<=*u*,<=*v*<=≤<=*n*) as the minimum number of brain connectors used when transmitting a thought between these two brains. The brain latency of a zombie is defined to be the maximum distance between any two of its brains. Researchers conjecture that the brain latency is the crucial parameter which determines how smart a given zombie is. Help them test this conjecture by writing a program to compute brain latencies of nervous systems.

In this problem you may assume that any nervous system given in the input is valid, i.e., it satisfies conditions (1) and (2) from the easy version.","The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=100000) denoting the number of brains (which are conveniently numbered from 1 to *n*) and the number of brain connectors in the nervous system, respectively.

61,A,Ultra-Fast Mathematician,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Shapur was an extremely gifted student. He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.

One day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.

In his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.

Shapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length ∞ (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.

Now you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.",There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number. It is guaranteed that the numbers are made from 0 and 1 only and that their length is same. The numbers may start with 0.

Trees are undirected acyclic graphs with *k* vertices and *k*<=-<=1 edges, where *k* is some integer. Note that one vertex is a valid tree.

There is exactly one relative living in each vertex of each tree, they have unique ids from 1 to *n*. For each Ball *i* we know the id of its most distant relative living on the same tree. If there are several such vertices, we only know the value of the one with smallest id among those.

How many trees are there in the forest?","The first line contains single integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=104) — the number of Balls living in the forest.

The second line contains a sequence *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n* of length *n*, where (1<=≤<=*p**i*<=≤<=*n*) holds and *p**i* denotes the most distant from Ball *i* relative living on the same tree. If there are several most distant relatives living on the same tree, *p**i* is the id of one with the smallest id.

It's guaranteed that the sequence *p* corresponds to some valid forest.

Hacking: To hack someone, you should provide a correct forest as a test. The sequence *p* will be calculated according to the forest and given to the solution you try to hack as input. Use the following format:

In the first line, output the integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=104) — the number of Balls and the integer *m* (0<=≤<=*m*<=&lt;<=*n*) — the total number of edges in the forest. Then *m* lines should follow. The *i*-th of them should contain two integers *a**i* and *b**i* and represent an edge between vertices in which relatives *a**i* and *b**i* live. For example, the first sample is written as follows:",You should output the number of trees in the forest where PolandBall lives.,"['5\n2 1 5 3 3', '1\n1\n']","['2', '1']","In the first sample testcase, possible forest is: 1-2 3-4-5.

227,B,Effective Approach,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.

According to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.

Vasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.

To finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.

But the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.","The first line contains integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105) — the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the elements of array. 

The third line contains integer *m* (1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=105) — the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=≤<=*b**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.","Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs. Separate the numbers by spaces.

In the second sample, on the contrary, Vasya's approach will need two comparisons (first with 1-st element, and then with the 2-nd), and Petya's approach will find the required value in one comparison (the first comparison with the 2-nd element).",TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED,"from sys import stdin, stdout

Let's call a connected component any non-extendible set of cells such that any two of them are connected by the path of adjacent cells. It is a typical well-known definition of a connected component.

For each impassable cell (*x*,<=*y*) imagine that it is an empty cell (all other cells remain unchanged) and find the size (the number of cells) of the connected component which contains (*x*,<=*y*). You should do it for each impassable cell independently.

The answer should be printed as a matrix with *n* rows and *m* columns. The *j*-th symbol of the *i*-th row should be ""."" if the cell is empty at the start.

553,B,Kyoya and Permutation,PROGRAMMING,"['binary search', 'combinatorics', 'constructive algorithms', 'greedy', 'implementation', 'math']","Let's define the permutation of length *n* as an array *p*<==<=[*p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n*] consisting of *n* distinct integers from range from 1 to *n*. We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value *p*1, value 2 into the value *p*2 and so on.

Kyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a permutation. A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle). The cyclic representation is a representation of *p* as a collection of cycles forming *p*. For example, permutation *p*<==<=[4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] has a cyclic representation that looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are swapped, and 5 remains in place. 

Permutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya defines the standard cyclic representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first. Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation of [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] is (421)(5)(63).

Now, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For instance, [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] will become [4,<=2,<=1,<=5,<=6,<=3].

Kyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of length *n* that do not change in a list in lexicographic order. Unfortunately, his friend Tamaki Suoh lost this list. Kyoya wishes to reproduce the list and he needs your help. Given the integers *n* and *k*, print the permutation that was *k*-th on Kyoya's list.","The first line will contain two integers *n*, *k* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=50, 1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=*min*{1018,<=*l*} where *l* is the length of the Kyoya's list).","Print *n* space-separated integers, representing the permutation that is the answer for the question.","['4 3\n', '10 1\n']","['1 3 2 4\n', '1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n']","The standard cycle representation is (1)(32)(4), which after removing parenthesis gives us the original permutation.

We are given a schedule for a smart lamp.
The lamp turns power (and light) on at time 0 and off at time M.
There is a preinstalled ""good"" program represented by an increasing list a,
with each a_i (0 < a_i < M). The lamp toggles its state at each a_i.
Thus initially the lamp is on (from 0 until a1), then off from a1 to a2,
then on from a2 to a3, and so on.
In the end (at time M) the power is turned off.
We are allowed to insert at most one extra toggle time x (an integer)
into the program so that it remains a good program.
Our goal is to maximize the total time when the lamp is lit.
We may also choose not to insert anything.

A known approach is:
  1. Build an extended list: ext = [0] + a + [M]
  2. Compute the total lit time in the original schedule (the ""base"")
     where lit intervals are the ones with even index segments:
         lit time = sum_{i even} (ext[i+1] - ext[i])
  3. Consider inserting a toggle in some gap (between ext[i] and ext[i+1])
     if the gap length > 1 (since we need to pick an integer that is strictly between).
  4. Inserting a toggle will flip the ""parity"" of the subsequent segments.
     One can compute the candidate lit time after an optimal insertion in
     that gap as follows:
         candidate = (lit time before the gap) +
                     (new contribution in the gap, which is gap-1)
                     + (flipped lit time in the remainder of the timeline).
     The lit time in the remainder after insertion becomes:
         (length of remainder) - (original lit time in the remainder)
  5. We take the maximum between the original base lit time and all candidates.

0,none,none,none,['none'],"In the year of $30XX$ participants of some world programming championship live in a single large hotel. The hotel has $n$ floors. Each floor has $m$ sections with a single corridor connecting all of them. The sections are enumerated from $1$ to $m$ along the corridor, and all sections with equal numbers on different floors are located exactly one above the other. Thus, the hotel can be represented as a rectangle of height $n$ and width $m$. We can denote sections with pairs of integers $(i, j)$, where $i$ is the floor, and $j$ is the section number on the floor.

The guests can walk along the corridor on each floor, use stairs and elevators. Each stairs or elevator occupies all sections $(1, x)$, $(2, x)$, $\ldots$, $(n, x)$ for some $x$ between $1$ and $m$. All sections not occupied with stairs or elevators contain guest rooms. It takes one time unit to move between neighboring sections on the same floor or to move one floor up or down using stairs. It takes one time unit to move up to $v$ floors in any direction using an elevator. You can assume you don't have to wait for an elevator, and the time needed to enter or exit an elevator is negligible.

You are to process $q$ queries. Each query is a question ""what is the minimum time needed to go from a room in section $(x_1, y_1)$ to a room in section $(x_2, y_2)$?""","The first line contains five integers $n, m, c_l, c_e, v$ ($2 \leq n, m \leq 10^8$, $0 \leq c_l, c_e \leq 10^5$, $1 \leq c_l + c_e \leq m - 1$, $1 \leq v \leq n - 1$) — the number of floors and section on each floor, the number of stairs, the number of elevators and the maximum speed of an elevator, respectively.

The second line contains $c_l$ integers $l_1, \ldots, l_{c_l}$ in increasing order ($1 \leq l_i \leq m$), denoting the positions of the stairs. If $c_l = 0$, the second line is empty.

The third line contains $c_e$ integers $e_1, \ldots, e_{c_e}$ in increasing order, denoting the elevators positions in the same format. It is guaranteed that all integers $l_i$ and $e_i$ are distinct.

The fourth line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \leq q \leq 10^5$) — the number of queries.

The next $q$ lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains four integers $x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$ ($1 \leq x_1, x_2 \leq n$, $1 \leq y_1, y_2 \leq m$) — the coordinates of starting and finishing sections for the query.

We know that when two people call each other via Spyke, the Spyke network assigns a unique ID to this call, a positive integer session number.

One day Polycarpus wondered which secretaries are talking via the Spyke and which are not. For each secretary, he wrote out either the session number of his call or a 0 if this secretary wasn't talking via Spyke at that moment.

Help Polycarpus analyze these data and find out the number of pairs of secretaries that are talking. If Polycarpus has made a mistake in the data and the described situation could not have taken place, say so.

Note that the secretaries can correspond via Spyke not only with each other, but also with the people from other places.

Let us remind you the rules of moving chess pieces. A chessboard is 64 square fields organized into an 8<=×<=8 table. A field is represented by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*) — the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:
 -  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically. -  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally. -  A king moves one field in any direction — horizontally, vertically or diagonally. 
Petya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2)? At that, we assume that there are no more pieces besides this one on the board. Help him solve this problem.","The input contains four integers *r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2 (1<=≤<=*r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2<=≤<=8) — the coordinates of the starting and the final field. The starting field doesn't coincide with the final one.

You can assume that the chessboard rows are numbered from top to bottom 1 through 8, and the columns are numbered from left to right 1 through 8.","Print three space-separated integers: the minimum number of moves the rook, the bishop and the king (in this order) is needed to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2).

903,B,The Modcrab,PROGRAMMING,"['greedy', 'implementation']","Vova is again playing some computer game, now an RPG. In the game Vova's character received a quest: to slay the fearsome monster called Modcrab.

After two hours of playing the game Vova has tracked the monster and analyzed its tactics. The Modcrab has *h*2 health points and an attack power of *a*2. Knowing that, Vova has decided to buy a lot of strong healing potions and to prepare for battle.

Vova's character has *h*1 health points and an attack power of *a*1. Also he has a large supply of healing potions, each of which increases his current amount of health points by *c*1 when Vova drinks a potion. All potions are identical to each other. It is guaranteed that *c*1<=&gt;<=*a*2.

The battle consists of multiple phases. In the beginning of each phase, Vova can either attack the monster (thus reducing its health by *a*1) or drink a healing potion (it increases Vova's health by *c*1; Vova's health can exceed *h*1). Then, if the battle is not over yet, the Modcrab attacks Vova, reducing his health by *a*2. The battle ends when Vova's (or Modcrab's) health drops to 0 or lower. It is possible that the battle ends in a middle of a phase after Vova's attack.

Of course, Vova wants to win the fight. But also he wants to do it as fast as possible. So he wants to make up a strategy that will allow him to win the fight after the minimum possible number of phases.

Help Vova to make up a strategy! You may assume that Vova never runs out of healing potions, and that he can always win.","The first line contains three integers *h*1, *a*1, *c*1 (1<=≤<=*h*1,<=*a*1<=≤<=100, 2<=≤<=*c*1<=≤<=100) — Vova's health, Vova's attack power and the healing power of a potion.

The second line contains two integers *h*2, *a*2 (1<=≤<=*h*2<=≤<=100, 1<=≤<=*a*2<=&lt;<=*c*1) — the Modcrab's health and his attack power.","In the first line print one integer *n* denoting the minimum number of phases required to win the battle.

Then print *n* lines. *i*-th line must be equal to HEAL if Vova drinks a potion in *i*-th phase, or STRIKE if he attacks the Modcrab.

The strategy must be valid: Vova's character must not be defeated before slaying the Modcrab, and the monster's health must be 0 or lower after Vova's last action.

If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.","['10 6 100\n17 5\n', '11 6 100\n12 5\n']","['4\nSTRIKE\nHEAL\nSTRIKE\nSTRIKE\n', '2\nSTRIKE\nSTRIKE\n']","In the first example Vova's character must heal before or after his first attack. Otherwise his health will drop to zero in 2 phases while he needs 3 strikes to win.

In the second example no healing needed, two strikes are enough to get monster to zero health and win with 6 health left.",WRONG_ANSWER,"import bisect

","# This Python script counts the number of “good paths” in Uzhlyandia.
# A good path is such that from all m roads, exactly 2 are traversed exactly once
# and the remaining m-2 roads are traversed twice. Two good paths are considered
# different if the sets of roads traversed exactly once differ.
#
# In the resulting multigraph, a road traversed twice contributes an even degree,
# while a road traversed once contributes an odd degree (unless it is a self-loop,
# which always contributes an even amount since it adds 2 to the degree).
# An Eulerian path in an undirected graph exists if and only if:
#    - all vertices have even degree (Eulerian circuit) or
#    - exactly 2 vertices have odd degree (Eulerian trail).
#
# Thus, when selecting two roads (from m roads) as the ones to traverse once,
# their contribution must yield an Eulerian multigraph covering all roads.
# Note that for a non self-loop edge (u, v) given once, both u and v get an odd increment.
#
# There are three cases for a valid pair S of roads traversed once:
# 1. Both roads are self-loops. Self-loops always contribute even degrees.
# 2. One road is a self-loop and the other is a non-self-loop.
#    The non-self-loop contributes 2 odd vertices.
# 3. Both roads are non-self-loop and they share exactly one endpoint.
#    For example, if the two edges are (u, v) and (v, w), then v gets an even sum (1+1),
#    and u and w are odd.
#
# Additionally, an Eulerian path exists only if the underlying multigraph is connected 
# when considering all roads. If the graph is disconnected (considering vertices which appear 
# in any road), then it is impossible to have a trail that covers all roads.
#
# The answer is the total count of valid pairs S (of two roads chosen among m) that yield an
# Eulerian configuration. Two paths are considered the same if the set of roads chosen exactly once is the same.
#
# This script reads the graph definition from standard input and outputs the answer.
#
# Time complexity: O(m+n) which is efficient for up to 10^6 roads.

873,D,Merge Sort,PROGRAMMING,"['constructive algorithms', 'divide and conquer']","Merge sort is a well-known sorting algorithm. The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:
 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=≤<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=≤<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. 
The array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).

The number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* — *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.

Ivan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.

Help Ivan to find an array he wants!","The first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100000, 1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=200000) — the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it.","If a permutation of size *n* such that there will be exactly *k* calls of *mergesort* while sorting it doesn't exist, output <=-<=1. Otherwise output *n* integer numbers *a*[0],<=*a*[1],<=...,<=*a*[*n*<=-<=1] — the elements of a permutation that would meet the required conditions.

Sergey gives Nastya the word *t* and wants to get the word *p* out of it. Nastya removes letters in a certain order (one after another, in this order strictly), which is specified by permutation of letters' indices of the word *t*: *a*1... *a*|*t*|.

Sergey knows this permutation. His goal is to stop his sister at some point and continue removing by himself to get the word *p*.

7,A,Kalevitch and Chess,PROGRAMMING,"['brute force', 'constructive algorithms']","A famous Berland's painter Kalevitch likes to shock the public. One of his last obsessions is chess. For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards.

As before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8<=×<=8 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke.

Kalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client's requirements.

It goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything — for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's needs. You are asked to help Kalevitch with this task.","The input file contains 8 lines, each of the lines contains 8 characters. The given matrix describes the client's requirements, W character stands for a white square, and B character — for a square painted black.

It is guaranteed that client's requirments can be fulfilled with a sequence of allowed strokes (vertical/column or horizontal/row).",Output the only number — the minimum amount of rows and columns that Kalevitch has to paint on the white chessboard to meet the client's requirements.,"['WWWBWWBW\nBBBBBBBB\nWWWBWWBW\nWWWBWWBW\nWWWBWWBW\nWWWBWWBW\nWWWBWWBW\nWWWBWWBW\n', 'WWWWWWWW\nBBBBBBBB\nWWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWWW\n']","['3\n', '1\n']",none,OK,"#!/usr/bin/python3

61,C,Capture Valerian,PROGRAMMING,['math'],"It's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.

Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.

Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.

Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number *a*. The second part is either an integer number *b* or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer *c* and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.

*c* is an integer written in base *a*, to open the door we should write it in base *b*. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!

Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:

Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.:
-  I=1-  V=5-  X=10-  L=50-  C=100-  D=500-  M=1000
Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1,<=000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.

Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.

Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.","The first line contains two integers *a* and *b* (2<=≤<=*a*,<=*b*<=≤<=25). Only *b* may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.

The next line contains a single non-negative integer *c* in base *a* which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. 

It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.",Write a single line that contains integer *c* in base *b*.

Determine whether Ilya could have won the game by making single turn or not. 

The rules of tic-tac-toe on the 4<=×<=4 field are as follows. Before the first turn all the field cells are empty. The two players take turns placing their signs into empty cells (the first player places Xs, the second player places Os). The player who places Xs goes first, the another one goes second. The winner is the player who first gets three of his signs in a row next to each other (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).","The tic-tac-toe position is given in four lines.

One day she came across a rather well-known problem: you've got an array of $n$ elements (the elements of the array are indexed starting from 1); also, there are $q$ queries, each one is defined by a pair of integers $l_i$, $r_i$ $(1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n)$. You need to find for each query the sum of elements of the array with indexes from $l_i$ to $r_i$, inclusive.

The little girl found the problem rather boring. She decided to reorder the array elements before replying to the queries in a way that makes the sum of query replies maximum possible. Your task is to find the value of this maximum sum.","The first line contains two space-separated integers $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5$) and $q$ ($1 \le q \le 2\cdot10^5$) — the number of elements in the array and the number of queries, correspondingly.

The next line contains $n$ space-separated integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 2\cdot10^5$) — the array elements.

Each of the following $q$ lines contains two space-separated integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) — the $i$-th query.","In a single line print, a single integer — the maximum sum of query replies after the array elements are reordered.

7,B,Memory Manager,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet — the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: 
 -  alloc n — to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x — to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment — to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; 
The memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.

The first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.

The second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.

The last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.

In the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.

You are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.","The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=≤<=*t*<=≤<=100;1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=100), where *t* — the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* — the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.","Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession. Output lines should go in the same order in which the operations are processed. Successful procession of alloc operation should return integers, starting with 1, as the identifiers of the allocated blocks.",['6 10\nalloc 5\nalloc 3\nerase 1\nalloc 6\ndefragment\nalloc 6\n'],['1\n2\nNULL\n3\n'],none,WRONG_ANSWER,"def main():

277,E,Binary Tree on Plane,PROGRAMMING,"['flows', 'trees']","A root tree is a directed acyclic graph that contains one node (root), from which there is exactly one path to any other node.

A root tree is binary if each node has at most two outgoing arcs.

When a binary tree is painted on the plane, all arcs should be directed from top to bottom. That is, each arc going from *u* to *v* must meet the condition *y**u*<=&gt;<=*y**v*.

You've been given the coordinates of all tree nodes. Your task is to connect these nodes by arcs so as to get the binary root tree and make the total length of the arcs minimum. All arcs of the built tree must be directed from top to bottom.","The first line contains a single integer *n* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=400) — the number of nodes in the tree. Then follow *n* lines, two integers per line: *x**i*,<=*y**i* (|*x**i*|,<=|*y**i*|<=≤<=103) — coordinates of the nodes. It is guaranteed that all points are distinct.","If it is impossible to build a binary root tree on the given points, print ""-1"". Otherwise, print a single real number — the total length of the arcs in the minimum binary tree.

You are given string *s* consisting of lowercase English letters only. Find its lexicographically largest palindromic subsequence.

We'll call a non-empty string *s*[*p*1*p*2... *p**k*] = *s**p*1*s**p*2... *s**p**k* (1 <=≤<= *p*1<=&lt;<=*p*2<=&lt;<=...<=&lt;<=*p**k* <=≤<= |*s*|) a subsequence of string *s* = *s*1*s*2... *s*|*s*|, where |*s*| is the length of string *s*. For example, strings ""abcb"", ""b"" and ""abacaba"" are subsequences of string ""abacaba"".

String *x* = *x*1*x*2... *x*|*x*| is lexicographically larger than string *y* = *y*1*y*2... *y*|*y*| if either |*x*| &gt; |*y*| and *x*1<==<=*y*1, *x*2<==<=*y*2, ...,<=*x*|*y*|<==<=*y*|*y*|, or there exists such number *r* (*r*<=&lt;<=|*x*|, *r*<=&lt;<=|*y*|) that *x*1<==<=*y*1, *x*2<==<=*y*2, ..., *x**r*<==<=*y**r* and *x**r*<=<=+<=<=1<=&gt;<=*y**r*<=<=+<=<=1. Characters in the strings are compared according to their ASCII codes. For example, string ""ranger"" is lexicographically larger than string ""racecar"" and string ""poster"" is lexicographically larger than string ""post"".

String *s* = *s*1*s*2... *s*|*s*| is a palindrome if it matches string *rev*(*s*) = *s*|*s*|*s*|*s*|<=-<=1... *s*1.

For example, let's say that Vitaly's favourite digits are 1 and 3, then number 12 isn't good and numbers 13 or 311 are. Also, number 111 is excellent and number 11 isn't. 

Now Vitaly is wondering, how many excellent numbers of length exactly *n* are there. As this number can be rather large, he asks you to count the remainder after dividing it by 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).

Polycarp wants to add and remove spaces in the string *s* to ensure the following: 
 -  each comma is followed by exactly one space (if the comma is the last character in the string, this rule does not apply to it), -  each ""three dots"" term is preceded by exactly one space (if the dots are at the beginning of the string, this rule does not apply to the term), -  if two consecutive numbers were separated by spaces only (one or more), then exactly one of them should be left, -  there should not be other spaces.

""""""
We want to count the number of sequences (a1, a2, ..., an) consisting of positive integers such that:
   • The sum of the sequence is equal to y.
   • The greatest common divisor gcd(a1, a2, ..., an) is exactly x.
Since any valid sequence must have every term divisible by x, we set
   ai = x * bi  for all i.
Then the sum condition becomes:
   x * (b1 + b2 + ... + bn) = y  -->  b1 + b2 + ... + bn = S,  where S = y // x.
Also, the condition gcd(a1,...,an) = x is equivalent to gcd(b1,...,bn) = 1.

It is well known that the number of compositions (ordered sum) of S 
into positive integers is f(S) = 2^(S-1).

Thus our problem reduces to: Count the number of compositions of S into positive integers b_i
such that gcd(b1, b2, ...)=1.

We can use inclusion–exclusion (with the Möbius function μ) to count sequences with gcd 1:
    answer = ∑_{d | S} μ(d) * f(S/d)
where the summation is taken only over square‐free divisors d.
If y is not divisible by x, there is no valid sequence.
Since the answer can be large, we take it modulo 10^9+7.

So each buyer took some integral positive number of apples, but maybe he didn't pay for a half of an apple (if the number of apples at the moment of the purchase was odd).

For each buyer grandma remembers if she gave a half of an apple as a gift or not. The cost of an apple is *p* (the number *p* is even).

The next *n* lines contains the description of buyers. Each buyer is described with the string half if he simply bought half of the apples and with the string halfplus if grandma also gave him a half of an apple as a gift.

There are *n* members, numbered 1 through *n*. *m* pairs of members are friends. Of course, a member can't be a friend with themselves.

Let A-B denote that members A and B are friends. Limak thinks that a network is reasonable if and only if the following condition is satisfied: For every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z then also X-Z.

For example: if Alan and Bob are friends, and Bob and Ciri are friends, then Alan and Ciri should be friends as well.

When viewed from the side, Mike's hard drive is an endless array of tracks. The tracks of the array are numbered from left to right with integers, starting with 1. In the initial state the *i*-th reading head is above the track number *h**i*. For each of the reading heads, the hard drive's firmware can move the head exactly one track to the right or to the left, or leave it on the current track. During the operation each head's movement does not affect the movement of the other heads: the heads can change their relative order; there can be multiple reading heads above any of the tracks. A track is considered read if at least one head has visited this track. In particular, all of the tracks numbered *h*1, *h*2, ..., *h**n* have been read at the beginning of the operation.

Mike needs to read the data on *m* distinct tracks with numbers *p*1, *p*2, ..., *p**m*. Determine the minimum time the hard drive firmware needs to move the heads and read all the given tracks. Note that an arbitrary number of other tracks can also be read.","The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers *n*, *m* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=105) — the number of disk heads and the number of tracks to read, accordingly. The second line contains *n* distinct integers *h**i* in ascending order (1<=≤<=*h**i*<=≤<=1010, *h**i*<=&lt;<=*h**i*<=+<=1) — the initial positions of the heads. The third line contains *m* distinct integers *p**i* in ascending order (1<=≤<=*p**i*<=≤<=1010, *p**i*<=&lt;<=*p**i*<=+<=1) - the numbers of tracks to read.

Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vičkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vičkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!

Leha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers ""*A* factorial"" and ""*B* factorial"". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1·2·3·...·(*x*<=-<=1)·*x*. For example 4!<==<=1·2·3·4<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.

There is also an absurdly simple road network — for each pair of different towns *x* and *y*, there is a bidirectional road between towns *x* and *y* if and only if there is no railway between them. Travelling to a different town using one railway or one road always takes exactly one hour.

A train and a bus leave town 1 at the same time. They both have the same destination, town *n*, and don't make any stops on the way (but they can wait in town *n*). The train can move only along railways and the bus can move only along roads.

You've been asked to plan out routes for the vehicles; each route can use any road/railway multiple times. One of the most important aspects to consider is safety — in order to avoid accidents at railway crossings, the train and the bus must not arrive at the same town (except town *n*) simultaneously.

Under these constraints, what is the minimum number of hours needed for both vehicles to reach town *n* (the maximum of arrival times of the bus and the train)? Note, that bus and train are not required to arrive to the town *n* at the same moment of time, but are allowed to do so.","The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=400, 0<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=*n*(*n*<=-<=1)<=/<=2) — the number of towns and the number of railways respectively.

Sam would spend the whole summer stocking hay to feed Dawn in winter. Sam scythed hay and put it into haystack. As Sam was a bright farmer, he tried to make the process of storing hay simpler and more convenient to use. He collected the hay into cubical hay blocks of the same size. Then he stored the blocks in his barn. After a summer spent in hard toil Sam stored *A*·*B*·*C* hay blocks and stored them in a barn as a rectangular parallelepiped *A* layers high. Each layer had *B* rows and each row had *C* blocks.

At the end of the autumn Sam came into the barn to admire one more time the hay he'd been stacking during this hard summer. Unfortunately, Sam was horrified to see that the hay blocks had been carelessly scattered around the barn. The place was a complete mess. As it turned out, thieves had sneaked into the barn. They completely dissembled and took away a layer of blocks from the parallelepiped's front, back, top and sides. As a result, the barn only had a parallelepiped containing (*A*<=-<=1)<=×<=(*B*<=-<=2)<=×<=(*C*<=-<=2) hay blocks. To hide the evidence of the crime, the thieves had dissembled the parallelepiped into single 1<=×<=1<=×<=1 blocks and scattered them around the barn. After the theft Sam counted *n* hay blocks in the barn but he forgot numbers *A*, *B* и *C*.

Given number *n*, find the minimally possible and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks.",The only line contains integer *n* from the problem's statement (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=109).,"Print space-separated minimum and maximum number of hay blocks that could have been stolen by the thieves.

Thus, the thieves could have stolen 32 - 4 = 28 hay blocks. If Sam initially had a parallelepiped consisting of 45 = 5 × 3 × 3 hay blocks in his barn, then after the theft the barn has 4 = (5 - 1) × (3 - 2) × (3 - 2) hay blocks left.

Pasha has installed a new game to his phone. The goal of the game is following. There is a rectangular field consisting of *n* row with *m* pixels in each row. Initially, all the pixels are colored white. In one move, Pasha can choose any pixel and color it black. In particular, he can choose the pixel that is already black, then after the boy's move the pixel does not change, that is, it remains black. Pasha loses the game when a 2<=×<=2 square consisting of black pixels is formed. 

Pasha has made a plan of *k* moves, according to which he will paint pixels. Each turn in his plan is represented as a pair of numbers *i* and *j*, denoting respectively the row and the column of the pixel to be colored on the current move.

    # When the game is played, every time Toastman receives a group, he adds the sum

    # and Toastman later adds the sums of the resulting groups.
    # Thus each original number is counted in every “node” of a binary splitting tree
    # in which that number has not yet been isolated.
    #
    # One may show that an optimal strategy is to “delay” splitting as much as possible
    # on the large numbers while isolating a (comparatively) small number at each split.
    # In other words, if we view the process as building a full binary tree with n leaves

    # It turns out that an optimal assignment of “multipliers” (i.e. the number of times
    # a number is added) to the sorted list is as follows:
    #   • if n == 1, the multiplier is 1;
    #   • if n >= 2, then when the numbers are sorted in non‐decreasing order the multipliers

In other words, the computer network can be represented as some non-directed graph with *n* nodes and *m* edges. Let's index the computers with integers from 1 to *n*, let's index the cables with integers from 1 to *m*.

Polycarpus was given an important task — check the reliability of his company's network. For that Polycarpus decided to carry out a series of *k* experiments on the computer network, where the *i*-th experiment goes as follows:
 1.  Temporarily disconnect the cables with indexes from *l**i* to *r**i*, inclusive (the other cables remain connected). 1.  Count the number of connected components in the graph that is defining the computer network at that moment. 1.  Re-connect the disconnected cables with indexes from *l**i* to *r**i* (that is, restore the initial network). 
Help Polycarpus carry out all experiments and for each print the number of connected components in the graph that defines the computer network through the given experiment. Isolated vertex should be counted as single component.","The first line contains two space-separated integers *n*, *m* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=500; 1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=104) — the number of computers and the number of cables, correspondingly.

Note that a pair of computers can be connected by multiple cables.

The pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=×<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.

Initially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.","First line contains two integers *R* (1<=≤<=*R*<=≤<=500) and *C* (1<=≤<=*C*<=≤<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.

33,A,What is for dinner?,PROGRAMMING,"['greedy', 'implementation']","In one little known, but very beautiful country called Waterland, lives a lovely shark Valerie. Like all the sharks, she has several rows of teeth, and feeds on crucians. One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are ""relaxing"".

For a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap).

It turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again. 

Unhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her. For sure, the shark couldn't say no to her favourite meal, but she had no desire to go back to the dentist. That's why she decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that the viability of no tooth becomes negative. 

As Valerie is not good at mathematics, she asked you to help her to find out the total amount of crucians that she can consume for dinner.

We should remind you that while eating one crucian Valerie uses exactly one row of teeth and the viability of each tooth from this row decreases by one.","The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=1000,<=0<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=106) — total amount of Valerie's teeth, amount of tooth rows and amount of crucians in Valerie's portion for dinner.

Crucial moment is just around the corner: Gogol is ready to release it's new tablet Lastus 3000.

This new device is equipped with specially designed artificial intelligence (AI). Employees of Pineapple did their best to postpone the release of Lastus 3000 as long as possible. Finally, they found out, that the name of the new artificial intelligence is similar to the name of the phone, that Pineapple released 200 years ago. As all rights on its name belong to Pineapple, they stand on changing the name of Gogol's artificial intelligence.

Pineapple insists, that the name of their phone occurs in the name of AI as a substring. Because the name of technology was already printed on all devices, the Gogol's director decided to replace some characters in AI name with ""#"". As this operation is pretty expensive, you should find the minimum number of characters to replace with ""#"", such that the name of AI doesn't contain the name of the phone as a substring.

Substring is a continuous subsequence of a string.","The first line of the input contains the name of AI designed by Gogol, its length doesn't exceed 100<=000 characters.

Iahub wants to visit each destination only once. Note that, crossing through a destination is not considered visiting, unless Iahub explicitly wants to visit it at that point.

You are given string *s* consisting of lowercase English letters only. Find its lexicographically largest palindromic subsequence.

For example, strings ""abcb"", ""b"" and ""abacaba"" are subsequences of string ""abacaba"".

String *x* = *x*1*x*2... *x*|*x*| is lexicographically larger than string *y* = *y*1*y*2... *y*|*y*| if either |*x*| &gt; |*y*| and *x*1<==<=*y*1, *x*2<==<=*y*2, ...,<=*x*|*y*|<==<=*y*|*y*|, or there exists such number *r* (*r*<=&lt;<=|*x*|, *r*<=&lt;<=|*y*|) that *x*1<==<=*y*1, *x*2<==<=*y*2, ..., *x**r*<==<=*y**r* and *x**r*<=<=+<=<=1<=&gt;<=*y**r*<=<=+<=<=1.

As the lecture was boring, Vasya decided to complete the picture by composing a graph *G* with the following properties: 
 -  *G* has exactly *n* vertices, numbered from 1 to *n*. -  For all pairs of vertices *i* and *j*, where *i*<=≠<=*j*, there is an edge connecting them if and only if characters *s**i* and *s**j* are either equal or neighbouring in the alphabet. That is, letters in pairs ""a""-""b"" and ""b""-""c"" are neighbouring, while letters ""a""-""c"" are not. 
Vasya painted the resulting graph near the string and then erased the string. Next day Vasya's friend Petya came to a lecture and found some graph at his desk. He had heard of Vasya's adventure and now he wants to find out whether it could be the original graph *G*, painted by Vasya.

If the string *s* exists, then print it on the second line of the output.

Why not make her own Codeforces, with blackjack and other really cool stuff? Many people will surely be willing to visit this splendid shrine of high culture.

In Mainframe a standard pack of 52 cards is used to play blackjack. The pack contains cards of 13 values: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jacks, queens, kings and aces. Each value also exists in one of four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. Also, each card earns some value in points assigned to it: cards with value from two to ten earn from 2 to 10 points, correspondingly. An ace can either earn 1 or 11, whatever the player wishes. The picture cards (king, queen and jack) earn 10 points. The number of points a card earns does not depend on the suit. The rules of the game are very simple. The player gets two cards, if the sum of points of those cards equals *n*, then the player wins, otherwise the player loses.

The player has already got the first card, it's the queen of spades. To evaluate chances for victory, you should determine how many ways there are to get the second card so that the sum of points exactly equals *n*.",The only line contains *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=25) — the required sum of points.,Print the numbers of ways to get the second card in the required way if the first card is the queen of spades.,"['12\n', '20\n', '10\n']","['4', '15', '0']","In the first sample only four two's of different suits can earn the required sum of points.

Each of the stages is defined by a lowercase Latin letter. This way, the rocket can be described by the string — concatenation of letters, which correspond to the stages.

There are $n$ stages available. The rocket must contain exactly $k$ of them. Stages in the rocket should be ordered by their weight. So, after the stage with some letter can go only stage with a letter, which is at least two positions after in the alphabet (skipping one letter in between, or even more). For example, after letter 'c' can't go letters 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd', but can go letters 'e', 'f', ..., 'z'.

For the rocket to fly as far as possible, its weight should be minimal. The weight of the rocket is equal to the sum of the weights of its stages. The weight of the stage is the number of its letter in the alphabet. For example, the stage 'a 'weighs one ton,' b 'weighs two tons, and' z' — $26$ tons.

61,A,Ultra-Fast Mathematician,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Shapur was an extremely gifted student. He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.

One day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.

In his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.

Shapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length ∞ (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.

Now you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.",There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number.

""Once upon a time, there lived an emperor. He was very rich and had much grain. One day he ordered to build a huge barn to put there all his grain. Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through. Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...""

More formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of *n* grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:
 -  *m* grains are brought to the barn. If *m* grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account). -  Sparrows come and eat grain. In the *i*-th day *i* sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. 
Anton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn. Anton doesn't know when the fairy tale ends, so he asked you to determine, by the end of which day the barn will become empty for the first time.

Maxim has a wallet which can be represented as an array of integers. His wallet contains $m$ bills, the $j$-th bill has value $a_j$.

Games in the shop are ordered from left to right, Maxim tries to buy every game in that order.

When Maxim stands at the position $i$ in the shop, he takes the first bill from his wallet (if his wallet is empty then he proceeds to the next position immediately) and tries to buy the $i$-th game using this bill. After Maxim tried to buy the $n$-th game, he leaves the shop.

We derive the recurrence using state transitions and solve it via fast matrix exponentiation.

The recurrence in vector form:
    Let a(n) be the number of ways to be at D after n steps,
        b(n) be the number of ways to be at one specific other vertex (A, B, or C) after n steps.

        b(n+1) = a(n) + 2 * b(n)      (from D to that vertex, or from one of the other two vertices)
We represent these transitions with the matrix M =

568,A,Primes or Palindromes?,PROGRAMMING,"['brute force', 'implementation', 'math', 'number theory']","Rikhail Mubinchik believes that the current definition of prime numbers is obsolete as they are too complex and unpredictable. A palindromic number is another matter. It is aesthetically pleasing, and it has a number of remarkable properties. Help Rikhail to convince the scientific community in this!

Let us remind you that a number is called prime if it is integer larger than one, and is not divisible by any positive integer other than itself and one.

Rikhail calls a number a palindromic if it is integer, positive, and its decimal representation without leading zeros is a palindrome, i.e. reads the same from left to right and right to left.

One problem with prime numbers is that there are too many of them. Let's introduce the following notation: π(*n*) — the number of primes no larger than *n*, *rub*(*n*) — the number of palindromic numbers no larger than *n*. Rikhail wants to prove that there are a lot more primes than palindromic ones.

He asked you to solve the following problem: for a given value of the coefficient *A* find the maximum *n*, such that π(*n*)<=≤<=*A*·*rub*(*n*).","The input consists of two positive integers *p*, *q*, the numerator and denominator of the fraction that is the value of *A* (, ).","If such maximum number exists, then print it.

","# This script calculates the number of ways to obtain a magic number (divisible by 5)

# For each valid ending position i, the number of ways to form a subsequence ending at i
# is 2^(i) (since we can choose any subset of digits from positions before i).
# Since s = a repeated k times and n = |a| * k can be huge, we use a mathematical formula.
#
# Let m = len(a). We represent each position in s as j + q*m, where 0 <= j < m and 0 <= q < k.
# For each occurrence where a[j] is in {0,5}, the contribution is:
#   sum over q from 0 to k-1 of 2^(j + q*m) = 2^j * (sum over q from 0 to k-1 of (2^m)^q).

979,C,Kuro and Walking Route,PROGRAMMING,"['dfs and similar', 'trees']","Kuro is living in a country called Uberland, consisting of $n$ towns, numbered from $1$ to $n$, and $n - 1$ bidirectional roads connecting these towns. It is possible to reach each town from any other. Each road connects two towns $a$ and $b$. Kuro loves walking and he is planning to take a walking marathon, in which he will choose a pair of towns $(u, v)$ ($u \neq v$) and walk from $u$ using the shortest path to $v$ (note that $(u, v)$ is considered to be different from $(v, u)$).

Oddly, there are 2 special towns in Uberland named Flowrisa (denoted with the index $x$) and Beetopia (denoted with the index $y$). Flowrisa is a town where there are many strong-scent flowers, and Beetopia is another town where many bees live. In particular, Kuro will avoid any pair of towns $(u, v)$ if on the path from $u$ to $v$, he reaches Beetopia after he reached Flowrisa, since the bees will be attracted with the flower smell on Kuro’s body and sting him.

Kuro wants to know how many pair of city $(u, v)$ he can take as his route. Since he’s not really bright, he asked you to help him with this problem.","The first line contains three integers $n$, $x$ and $y$ ($1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \leq x, y \leq n$, $x \ne y$) - the number of towns, index of the town Flowrisa and index of the town Beetopia, respectively.

$n - 1$ lines follow, each line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \leq a, b \leq n$, $a \ne b$), describes a road connecting two towns $a$ and $b$.

It is guaranteed that from each town, we can reach every other town in the city using the given roads. That is, the given map of towns and roads is a tree.","A single integer resembles the number of pair of towns $(u, v)$ that Kuro can use as his walking route.","['3 1 3\n1 2\n2 3\n', '3 1 3\n1 2\n1 3\n']","['5', '4']","On the first example, Kuro can choose these pairs: 
 -  $(1, 2)$: his route would be $1 \rightarrow 2$, -  $(2, 3)$: his route would be $2 \rightarrow 3$, -  $(3, 2)$: his route would be $3 \rightarrow 2$, -  $(2, 1)$: his route would be $2 \rightarrow 1$, -  $(3, 1)$: his route would be $3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1$. 
Kuro can't choose pair $(1, 3)$ since his walking route would be $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3$, in which Kuro visits town $1$ (Flowrisa) and then visits town $3$ (Beetopia), which is not allowed (note that pair $(3, 1)$ is still allowed because although Kuro visited Flowrisa and Beetopia, he did not visit them in that order).

On the second example, Kuro can choose the following pairs: 
 -  $(1, 2)$: his route would be $1 \rightarrow 2$, -  $(2, 1)$: his route would be $2 \rightarrow 1$, -  $(3, 2)$: his route would be $3 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2$, -  $(3, 1)$: his route would be $3 \rightarrow 1$.",WRONG_ANSWER,"from collections import deque

The game is played on a tree having *n* nodes, numbered from 1 to *n*. Each node *i* has an initial value *init**i*, which is either 0 or 1. The root of the tree is node 1.

One can perform several (possibly, zero) operations on the tree during the game. The only available type of operation is to pick a node *x*. Right after someone has picked node *x*, the value of node *x* flips, the values of sons of *x* remain the same, the values of sons of sons of *x* flips, the values of sons of sons of sons of *x* remain the same and so on.

If we cannot determine exactly who should leave the ship first for any two members of the crew by the rules from the previous paragraph, then the one who stands to the left in the line leaves the ship first (or in other words, the one whose number in the line is less).

He has a huge number $s$. Polycarp wants to cut from it the maximum number of numbers that are divisible by $3$. To do this, he makes an arbitrary number of vertical cuts between pairs of adjacent digits. As a result, after $m$ such cuts, there will be $m+1$ parts in total. Polycarp analyzes each of the obtained numbers and finds the number of those that are divisible by $3$.

For example, if the original number is $s=3121$, then Polycarp can cut it into three parts with two cuts: $3|1|21$. As a result, he will get two numbers that are divisible by $3$.

Polycarp can make an arbitrary number of vertical cuts, where each cut is made between a pair of adjacent digits. The resulting numbers cannot contain extra leading zeroes (that is, the number can begin with 0 if and only if this number is exactly one character '0').

The rebuilding consists of performing several (perhaps zero) operations. An operation constitutes using a crane to take any tower and put it altogether on the top of some other neighboring tower. In other words, we can take the tower that stands *i*-th and put it on the top of either the (*i*<=-<=1)-th tower (if it exists), or the (*i*<=+<=1)-th tower (of it exists). The height of the resulting tower equals the sum of heights of the two towers that were put together. After that the two towers can't be split by any means, but more similar operations can be performed on the resulting tower.

227,B,Effective Approach,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.

According to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.

Vasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.

To finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.

But the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.","The first line contains integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105) — the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the elements of array. 

The third line contains integer *m* (1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=105) — the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=≤<=*b**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.","Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs. Separate the numbers by spaces.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++.

In the second sample, on the contrary, Vasya's approach will need two comparisons (first with 1-st element, and then with the 2-nd), and Petya's approach will find the required value in one comparison (the first comparison with the 2-nd element).",TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED,"from sys import stdin

We will consider the rows of the field numbered with integers from 1 to 109 from top to bottom. The columns are similarly numbered with integers from 1 to 109 from left to right. We will denote a cell of the field that is located in the *i*-th row and *j*-th column as (*i*,<=*j*).

You know that some squares of the given chess field are allowed. All allowed cells of the chess field are given as *n* segments. Each segment is described by three integers *r**i*,<=*a**i*,<=*b**i* (*a**i*<=≤<=*b**i*), denoting that cells in columns from number *a**i* to number *b**i* inclusive in the *r**i*-th row are allowed.

Your task is to find the minimum number of moves the king needs to get from square (*x*0,<=*y*0) to square (*x*1,<=*y*1), provided that he only moves along the allowed cells. In other words, the king can be located only on allowed cells on his way.

The second line contains a single integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105), denoting the number of segments of allowed cells. Next *n* lines contain the descriptions of these segments. The *i*-th line contains three space-separated integers *r**i*,<=*a**i*,<=*b**i* (1<=≤<=*r**i*,<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=≤<=109,<=*a**i*<=≤<=*b**i*), denoting that cells in columns from number *a**i* to number *b**i* inclusive in the *r**i*-th row are allowed. Note that the segments of the allowed cells can intersect and embed arbitrarily.

""""""
Mishka’s Christmas tree decoration problem.

There are three garlands with periods k1, k2, k3.
When a garland is switched on at second x, it lights at seconds:
    x, x + k, x + 2k, … 
Mishka wants to choose switch‐on times x1, x2, x3 such that
for every second t ≥ max(x1, x2, x3) at least one garland is lit.

It turns out that by shifting time (subtracting max(x1,x2,x3))
this is equivalent to choosing three residues a1 (mod k1),
a2 (mod k2), a3 (mod k3) so that for every nonnegative integer t,
at least one of these three congruences holds:
    t ≡ a1 (mod k1)  or  t ≡ a2 (mod k2)  or  t ≡ a3 (mod k3).
Since these progressions are periodic with period L = lcm(k1,k2,k3)
the covering property reduces to covering the complete set Z_L.
One may show (using the inclusion–exclusion formula)
that a necessary and sufficient condition is that

    (L/k1 + L/k2 + L/k3)
      – [sum of sizes of pair intersections]
      + [size of triple intersection]  =  L.

Dividing by L, and writing the sizes as fractions, one obtains
an equation of the form

    1/k1 + 1/k2 + 1/k3 – 1 = 
         Σ (over i<j) { contribution from pair (i,j) }.

Here the “potential” contribution from a given pair (i,j) is
    V_ij = (gcd(k_i, k_j)) / (k_i * k_j).

But note: if gcd(k_i,k_j) = 1 then the condition “r_i ≡ r_j (mod 1)” 
is forced (since any two integers are congruent modulo 1) and the contribution
is unavoidably 1/(k_i*k_j). For a pair with gcd > 1 one has the freedom 
to “force” the intersection (adding V_ij) or not (adding 0).

Thus the covering is possible if and only if there is a choice
of binary values b_ij ∈ {0,1} for the pairs with gcd(k_i,k_j) > 1
(since pairs with gcd=1 are forced to be “on”) such that

       1/k1 + 1/k2 + 1/k3 – 1  
           =  Σ_forced[1/(k_i*k_j)]  +  Σ_free[ b_ij * (gcd(k_i,k_j)/(k_i*k_j)) ].

In the code below we compute the left‐side (target)
and then for each of the three pairs of garlands we add either:
  • a forced contribution (if gcd == 1) or
  • a free candidate contribution (if gcd > 1).
We then try all possibilities for the free choices (there are at most 3).
If one possibility makes the equality hold (using exact rational arithmetic),
we print ""YES"" (otherwise ""NO"").

Note: if any k_i is 1 the answer is trivially YES.

191,A,Dynasty Puzzles,PROGRAMMING,['dp'],"The ancient Berlanders believed that the longer the name, the more important its bearer is. Thus, Berland kings were famous for their long names. But long names are somewhat inconvenient, so the Berlanders started to abbreviate the names of their kings. They called every king by the first letters of its name. Thus, the king, whose name was Victorious Vasily Pupkin, was always called by the berlanders VVP.

In Berland over its long history many dynasties of kings replaced each other, but they were all united by common traditions. Thus, according to one Berland traditions, to maintain stability in the country, the first name of the heir should be the same as the last name his predecessor (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the heir coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the predecessor). Berlanders appreciate stability, so this tradition has never been broken. Also Berlanders like perfection, so another tradition requires that the first name of the first king in the dynasty coincides with the last name of the last king in this dynasty (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the first king coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the last king). This tradition, of course, has also been always observed.

The name of a dynasty is formed by very simple rules: we take all the short names of the kings in the order in which they ruled, and write them in one line. Thus, a dynasty of kings ""ab"" and ""ba"" is called ""abba"", and the dynasty, which had only the king ""abca"", is called ""abca"".

Vasya, a historian, has recently found a list of abbreviated names of all Berland kings and their relatives. Help Vasya to find the maximally long name of the dynasty that could have existed in Berland.

Note that in his list all the names are ordered by the time, that is, if name *A* is earlier in the list than *B*, then if *A* and *B* were kings, then king *A* ruled before king *B*.","The first line contains integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=5·105) — the number of names in Vasya's list.

The market analysts came up with a very smart plan: the name of the company should be identical to its reflection in a mirror! In other words, if we write out the name of the company on a piece of paper in a line (horizontally, from left to right) with large English letters, then put this piece of paper in front of the mirror, then the reflection of the name in the mirror should perfectly match the line written on the piece of paper.

There are many suggestions for the company name, so coming up to the mirror with a piece of paper for each name wouldn't be sensible. The founders of the company decided to automatize this process. They asked you to write a program that can, given a word, determine whether the word is a 'mirror' word or not.",The first line contains a non-empty name that needs to be checked.

1006,D,Two Strings Swaps,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"You are given two strings $a$ and $b$ consisting of lowercase English letters, both of length $n$. The characters of both strings have indices from $1$ to $n$, inclusive. 

You are allowed to do the following changes: 
 -  Choose any index $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) and swap characters $a_i$ and $b_i$; -  Choose any index $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) and swap characters $a_i$ and $a_{n - i + 1}$; -  Choose any index $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) and swap characters $b_i$ and $b_{n - i + 1}$. 
Note that if $n$ is odd, you are formally allowed to swap $a_{\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil}$ with $a_{\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil}$ (and the same with the string $b$) but this move is useless. Also you can swap two equal characters but this operation is useless as well.

You have to make these strings equal by applying any number of changes described above, in any order. But it is obvious that it may be impossible to make two strings equal by these swaps.

In one preprocess move you can replace a character in $a$ with another character. In other words, in a single preprocess move you can choose any index $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$), any character $c$ and set $a_i := c$.

Your task is to find the minimum number of preprocess moves to apply in such a way that after them you can make strings $a$ and $b$ equal by applying some number of changes described in the list above.

Note that the number of changes you make after the preprocess moves does not matter. Also note that you cannot apply preprocess moves to the string $b$ or make any preprocess moves after the first change is made.","The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) — the length of strings $a$ and $b$.

There is no way to use fewer than $4$ preprocess moves before a sequence of changes to make string equal, so the answer in this example is $4$.

""""""
We are given an array of integers a1, a2, ..., ak such that the number of turns 
n is the product of all these numbers. In the game, there are three cups and the key is 
initially under the middle cup. At every turn, the middle cup is swapped with one randomly 
chosen from the other two (each with probability 1/2) and the key remains in its cup.
The probability that after n turns the key is under the middle cup is derived to be

    P = 1/3 + (2/3)*(-1/2)^n
     = (2^n + 2*(-1)^n) / (3 * 2^n)

After canceling the common factor 2 (note that when n ≥ 1 the numerator is always even), 
the expression becomes:
   - For n even: P = (2^(n-1) + 1) / (3 * 2^(n-1))
   - For n odd:  P = (2^(n-1) - 1) / (3 * 2^(n-1))
   
Because n is huge (it is the product of large numbers) we will compute:
  • the parity of n by checking if all factors are odd (n is odd if and only if every a_i is odd)
  • 2^(n-1) modulo MOD (with MOD = 10^9+7) by reducing the exponent modulo MOD-1.
Finally, after obtaining the irreducible fraction p/q we output the remainders of p and q modulo 10^9+7.

""""""
Bajtek is learning to skate on ice. His only mode of transportation is to push-off from a snow drift in one of the four
cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) and slide until he reaches another snow drift. However, some snow drifts
are not connected via such moves. The goal is to determine the minimal number of additional snow drifts (placed at integer 
coordinates) that needs to be created to connect all the given snow drifts.
 
A key observation:
For any set of drifts lying on the same vertical line (same x-coordinate), connecting consecutive drifts (sorted by y)
will make them reachable via a north/south move. Similarly, for drifts on the same horizontal line (same y-coordinate),
connecting consecutive drifts (sorted by x) will make them reachable via an east/west move.
Thus, we can build a graph where an edge exists between these consecutive drifts.
The minimal additional drifts required is the number of connected components minus one.

It is possible to reach each town from any other. Each road connects two towns $a$ and $b$. Kuro loves walking and he is planning to take a walking marathon, in which he will choose a pair of towns $(u, v)$ ($u \neq v$) and walk from $u$ using the shortest path to $v$ (note that $(u, v)$ is considered to be different from $(v, u)$).

Oddly, there are 2 special towns in Uberland named Flowrisa (denoted with the index $x$) and Beetopia (denoted with the index $y$). Flowrisa is a town where there are many strong-scent flowers, and Beetopia is another town where many bees live. In particular, Kuro will avoid any pair of towns $(u, v)$ if on the path from $u$ to $v$, he reaches Beetopia after he reached Flowrisa, since the bees will be attracted with the flower smell on Kuro’s body and sting him.

Kuro wants to know how many pair of city $(u, v)$ he can take as his route. Since he’s not really bright, he asked you to help him with this problem.","The first line contains three integers $n$, $x$ and $y$ ($1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \leq x, y \leq n$, $x \ne y$) - the number of towns, index of the town Flowrisa and index of the town Beetopia, respectively.

$n - 1$ lines follow, each line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \leq a, b \leq n$, $a \ne b$), describes a road connecting two towns $a$ and $b$.

It is guaranteed that from each town, we can reach every other town in the city using the given roads. That is, the given map of towns and roads is a tree.","A single integer resembles the number of pair of towns $(u, v)$ that Kuro can use as his walking route.","['3 1 3\n1 2\n2 3\n', '3 1 3\n1 2\n1 3\n']","['5', '4']","On the first example, Kuro can choose these pairs:

# such that none of its sides is parallel to the coordinate axes.
#
# We use a construction that places the right angle at point P2.
# We aim to represent one of the legs (of length a) as a vector (x, y)
# with x^2 + y^2 = a^2 and both x and y nonzero.
# Then the other leg (of length b) will be chosen as the 90° rotation
# of (x, y) scaled by a factor k = b / a:
#     (x, y) rotated is (-y, x)
# so that second vector is ( -k*y, k*x ).
#
# Then the three vertices (with the right angle at (x, y)) are:
#   P1 = (0, 0)

# 3. In addition, none of the three sides can be parallel to the axes;
#    this is guaranteed if none of the differences in x or y is 0.
#    In our construction, note that (x,y) has both nonzero components.
#    The vector (-k*y, k*x) obviously has nonzero components since x and y are nonzero.
#    For the third side, we must have x - k*y != 0.

The main character of this game has *n* different skills, each of which is characterized by an integer *a**i* from 0 to 100.

The expression ⌊ *x*⌋ denotes the result of rounding the number *x* down to the nearest integer.

At the beginning of the game Petya got *k* improvement units as a bonus that he can use to increase the skills of his character and his total rating. One improvement unit can increase any skill of Petya's character by exactly one. For example, if *a*4<==<=46, after using one imporvement unit to this skill, it becomes equal to 47. A hero's skill cannot rise higher more than 100. Thus, it is permissible that some of the units will remain unused.

Your task is to determine the optimal way of using the improvement units so as to maximize the overall rating of the character. It is not necessary to use all the improvement units.","The first line of the input contains two positive integers *n* and *k* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105, 0<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=107) — the number of skills of the character and the number of units of improvements at Petya's disposal.

In the second test the optimal strategy for Petya is to improve the first skill to 20 (by spending 3 improvement units) and to improve the third skill to 20 (in this case by spending 1 improvement units). Thus, Petya is left with 4 improvement units and he will be able to increase the second skill to 19 (which does not change the overall rating, so Petya does not necessarily have to do it).

main()","# This script counts the number of ways to increase the lengths of three sticks,
# originally of lengths a, b, c (which are sorted so that a <= b <= c),
# by nonnegative amounts (each positive increase is at least 1, but 0 is allowed)
# with a total increment of at most l, such that the resulting sticks can form a
# non‐degenerate triangle (triangle with positive area).
#
# A necessary and sufficient condition for three sides L1, L2, L3 to form a 
# non-degenerate triangle is that the sum of the three sides is greater than 
# twice the largest side, i.e., L1 + L2 + L3 > 2 * max(L1, L2, L3).
#
# If we denote the increments by x, y, and z (with x, y, z >= 0 and x+y+z = n
# for some n in [0, l]), then the new side lengths are:
#     A = a + x, B = b + y, C = c + z.
# Their total is S0 + n where S0 = a+b+c, and the triangle condition becomes:
#     S0 + n > 2 * max(a+x, b+y, c+z)
#
# This is equivalent to requiring that the maximum new side M satisfies:
#     M <= floor((S0+n - 1) / 2)
#
# For each stick i with initial length (a, b, c) and increment (x, y, z) respectively,
# we need a+x <= K, b+y <= K, c+z <= K where K = floor((S0+n - 1) / 2).
# That means:
#     x <= K - a, y <= K - b, and z <= K - c.
#
# For each total increment n (0 <= n <= l), we count the number of solutions in nonnegative 
# integers to x+y+z = n with x <= U, y <= V, z <= W where:
#     U = K - a, V = K - b, W = K - c.
#
# The number of nonnegative solutions of x+y+z = n (without restrictions) is C(n+2, 2).
# To count the number of solutions with upper bounds, we use inclusion-exclusion.
#
# For a nonnegative integer r, define:
#     comb(r) = 0 if r < 0, else (r+1)*(r+2)//2, which equals C(r+2, 2)
#
# Then, for a given n, the number of valid distributions is:
#
#     total   = comb(n)
#     bad_x   = comb(n - (U+1))   -- solutions with x > U
#     bad_y   = comb(n - (V+1))   -- solutions with y > V

""""""
We are given two arrays: a (of integers) and b_prime (as a string of '0's and '1's),
and two unknown thresholds l and r (with -10^9 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9). The array b is produced
from a and the thresholds by the following procedure:

    • b[0] = b[1] = b[2] = b[3] = 0.
    • For every index i from 4 to n-1 (which corresponds to positions 5 to n in 1‐indexing):
          – If the previous 4 b’s are all 0 then:
                 if all of a[i-4], a[i-3], a[i-2], a[i-1], a[i] are strictly less than l 
                 then b[i] becomes 1 (forced switch); otherwise, b[i] remains 0.
          – If the previous 4 b’s are all 1 then:
                 if all of a[i-4], a[i-3], a[i-2], a[i-1], a[i] are strictly greater than r

          – In all other cases, b[i] simply equals b[i-1].

Our goal is to find any pair (l, r) making the produced array b equal to the given b_prime.

Observation: When a forced switch happens, the thresholds must “just beat” the extremal value 
of the corresponding block:
    • Forced change 0 -> 1: if b’s from i-4 to i-1 are 0 and b[i]=='1', then all values in the block must be < l.
      In other words, l > max(a[i-4..i]). So we require l >= max(a[i-4..i]) + 1.
    • Forced change 1 -> 0: if b’s from i-4 to i-1 are 1 and b[i]=='0', then all values in the block must be > r.
      So, r < min(a[i-4..i]), i.e. r <= min(a[i-4..i]) - 1.

When no forced change occurs (the b value stays equal to the previous value) the threshold must not be so extreme:
    • For a block with previous four 0’s and b[i]=='0': it cannot be that all values are < l.
      Thus, at least one value is ≥ l. Equivalently, l ≤ max(a[i-4..i]).
    • For a block with previous four 1’s and b[i]=='1': it cannot be that all values are > r.
      Hence, r ≥ min(a[i-4..i]).

We accumulate these inequalities for all indices where the previous four b’s are uniform.
Then, we choose any l and r satisfying:
    l in [L_low, L_high]   and  r in [r_low, r_high]   with  l ≤ r.
It is guaranteed that an answer exists.

We shall consider only the following basic parameters: attack (atk), defense (def) and resistance to different types of impact (res).

Each item belongs to one class. In this problem we will only consider three of such classes: weapon, armor, orb.

Besides, there's a whole new world hidden inside each item. We can increase an item's level travelling to its world. We can also capture the so-called residents in the Item World

Residents are the creatures that live inside items. Each resident gives some bonus to the item in which it is currently located. We will only consider residents of types: gladiator (who improves the item's atk), sentry (who improves def) and physician (who improves res).

Each item has the size parameter. The parameter limits the maximum number of residents that can live inside an item. We can move residents between items. Within one moment of time we can take some resident from an item and move it to some other item if it has a free place for a new resident. We cannot remove a resident from the items and leave outside — any of them should be inside of some item at any moment of time.

Laharl has a certain number of items. He wants to move the residents between items so as to equip himself with weapon, armor and a defensive orb. The weapon's atk should be largest possible in the end. Among all equipping patterns containing weapon's maximum atk parameter we should choose the ones where the armor’s def parameter is the largest possible. Among all such equipment patterns we should choose the one where the defensive orb would have the largest possible res parameter.

1009,E,Intercity Travelling,PROGRAMMING,"['combinatorics', 'math', 'probabilities']","Leha is planning his journey from Moscow to Saratov. He hates trains, so he has decided to get from one city to another by car.

The path from Moscow to Saratov can be represented as a straight line (well, it's not that straight in reality, but in this problem we will consider it to be straight), and the distance between Moscow and Saratov is $n$ km. Let's say that Moscow is situated at the point with coordinate $0$ km, and Saratov — at coordinate $n$ km.

Driving for a long time may be really difficult. Formally, if Leha has already covered $i$ kilometers since he stopped to have a rest, he considers the difficulty of covering $(i + 1)$-th kilometer as $a_{i + 1}$. It is guaranteed that for every $i \in [1, n - 1]$ $a_i \le a_{i + 1}$. The difficulty of the journey is denoted as the sum of difficulties of each kilometer in the journey.

Fortunately, there may be some rest sites between Moscow and Saratov. Every integer point from $1$ to $n - 1$ may contain a rest site. When Leha enters a rest site, he may have a rest, and the next kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the kilometer after it — difficulty $a_2$, and so on.

For example, if $n = 5$ and there is a rest site in coordinate $2$, the difficulty of journey will be $2a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3$: the first kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the second one — $a_2$, then Leha will have a rest, and the third kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the fourth — $a_2$, and the last one — $a_3$. Another example: if $n = 7$ and there are rest sites in coordinates $1$ and $5$, the difficulty of Leha's journey is $3a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3 + a_4$.

Leha doesn't know which integer points contain rest sites. So he has to consider every possible situation. Obviously, there are $2^{n - 1}$ different distributions of rest sites (two distributions are different if there exists some point $x$ such that it contains a rest site in exactly one of these distributions). Leha considers all these distributions to be equiprobable. He wants to calculate $p$ — the expected value of difficulty of his journey.

Obviously, $p \cdot 2^{n - 1}$ is an integer number. You have to calculate it modulo $998244353$.","The first line contains one number $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^6$) — the distance from Moscow to Saratov.

""""""
We are given a permutation p[0..n‐1] and an integer k.
In one “operation” a random contiguous segment [l,r] (1-indexed) is chosen uniformly 
among all n(n+1)/2 possibilities and the segment is reversed.
A useful observation is that the effect on the relative order of any two numbers 
can be “linearized” if we compute their probability to swap.
For a pair of positions i and j (0-indexed; corresponding to positions i+1 and j+1),
an interval [l, r] (with 1<=l<=r<=n) will “flip” the order of the two elements 
if and only if both positions lie inside [l,r].
Thus one natural “model” is to view the pair’s state (which we encode by +1 
if the pair is in “natural” order and –1 if not) as evolving according 
to a “flip” that occurs with probability

   f = ((i+1)*(n - j)) / (n*(n+1)/2)

(note that we use (i+1) and (n–j) because i and j are 0‐indexed).
Then one reversal “updates” the expectation by a multiplier of

   r = 1 – 2*f.
In one operation the expected “imbalance” becomes
      s' = (1 – 2*f)* s.
Since the process converges to equilibrium (s=0 meaning that the eventual probability 
of having either order is 1/2), after k independent operations the expected s is
      s(k) = s0 * (1 – 2*f)^k.
If we define the natural “good” order to be the one where the number that should be 
smaller appears earlier, then if the pair’s initial state is “good” (s0 = +1) the probability
that it remains good is
      p_good = 0.5 + 0.5*(1 – 2*f)^k,
and conversely if the pair starts “bad” (s0 = –1) the chance it is bad at the end is the same.
Since an inversion is defined (for a pair with numbers a and b with a < b) as occurring 
when the order is “bad,” we get that the inversion probability for that pair is

    p_inv = 0.5 – 0.5*(1 – 2*f)^k   if the pair initially is good,
    p_inv = 0.5 + 0.5*(1 – 2*f)^k   if the pair initially is bad.

Finally, by linearity the expected number of inversions is the sum over all pairs.
(This model gives exactly the answers when k and n are small.)

When playing two on two, one player of each team controls the goalkeeper and the full-backs (plays defence), the other player controls the half-backs and forwards (plays attack).

Two teams of company Q decided to battle each other. Let's enumerate players from both teams by integers from 1 to 4. The first and second player play in the first team, the third and the fourth one play in the second team. For each of the four players we know their game skills in defence and attack. The defence skill of the *i*-th player is *a**i*, the attack skill is *b**i*.

Before the game, the teams determine how they will play. First the players of the first team decide who will play in the attack, and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do the same, based on the choice of their opponents.

We will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.

The teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally.

1004,C,Sonya and Robots,PROGRAMMING,"['constructive algorithms', 'implementation']","Since Sonya is interested in robotics too, she decided to construct robots that will read and recognize numbers.

Sonya has drawn $n$ numbers in a row, $a_i$ is located in the $i$-th position. She also has put a robot at each end of the row (to the left of the first number and to the right of the last number). Sonya will give a number to each robot (they can be either same or different) and run them. When a robot is running, it is moving toward to another robot, reading numbers in the row. When a robot is reading a number that is equal to the number that was given to that robot, it will turn off and stay in the same position.

Sonya does not want robots to break, so she will give such numbers that robots will stop before they meet. That is, the girl wants them to stop at different positions so that the first robot is to the left of the second one.

For example, if the numbers $[1, 5, 4, 1, 3]$ are written, and Sonya gives the number $1$ to the first robot and the number $4$ to the second one, the first robot will stop in the $1$-st position while the second one in the $3$-rd position. In that case, robots will not meet each other. As a result, robots will not be broken. But if Sonya gives the number $4$ to the first robot and the number $5$ to the second one, they will meet since the first robot will stop in the $3$-rd position while the second one is in the $2$-nd position.

Sonya understands that it does not make sense to give a number that is not written in the row because a robot will not find this number and will meet the other robot.

Sonya is now interested in finding the number of different pairs that she can give to robots so that they will not meet. In other words, she wants to know the number of pairs ($p$, $q$), where she will give $p$ to the first robot and $q$ to the second one. Pairs ($p_i$, $q_i$) and ($p_j$, $q_j$) are different if $p_i\neq p_j$ or $q_i\neq q_j$.

Unfortunately, Sonya is busy fixing robots that broke after a failed launch. That is why she is asking you to find the number of pairs that she can give to robots so that they will not meet.","The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1\leq n\leq 10^5$) — the number of numbers in a row.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1\leq a_i\leq 10^5$) — the numbers in a row.",Print one number — the number of possible pairs that Sonya can give to robots so that they will not meet.,"['5\n1 5 4 1 3\n', '7\n1 2 1 1 1 3 2\n']","['9\n', '7\n']","In the first example, Sonya can give pairs ($1$, $1$), ($1$, $3$), ($1$, $4$), ($1$, $5$), ($4$, $1$), ($4$, $3$), ($5$, $1$), ($5$, $3$), and ($5$, $4$).

152,B,Steps,PROGRAMMING,"['binary search', 'implementation']","One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: ""How did he do that?"" The answer is simple.

Vasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=×<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=≤<=*x*<=≤<=*n*,<=1<=≤<=*y*<=≤<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.

Initially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).

A step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.

Vasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.","The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=109) — the yard's sizes. The second line contains integers *x**c* and *y**c* — the initial square's coordinates (1<=≤<=*x**c*<=≤<=*n*,<=1<=≤<=*y**c*<=≤<=*m*).

The third line contains an integer *k* (1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=104) — the number of vectors. Then follow *k* lines, each of them contains two integers *dx**i* and *dy**i* (|*dx**i*|,<=|*dy**i*|<=≤<=109,<=|*dx*|<=+<=|*dy*|<=≥<=1).","Print the single number — the number of steps Vasya had made.

For example, each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform and guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well. For each team the color of the home and guest uniform is different.

There are *n* teams taking part in the national championship. The championship consists of *n*·(*n*<=-<=1) games: each team invites each other team to its stadium. At this point Manao wondered: how many times during the championship is a host team going to put on the guest uniform? Note that the order of the games does not affect this number.

    # We want to count the number of ordered pairs (i, j) (indices from the array)
    # such that a[i] <= a[j] and there are exactly k integers y in [a[i], a[j]]
    # with y divisible by x.
    #
    # For a fixed lower bound L = a[i], the condition on a[j] is:
    #   floor(a[j]/x) - floor((L-1)/x) = k.
    # Let T = floor((L-1)/x) + k. Then we need:
    #   floor(a[j]/x) = T.
    # And since for any t, floor(t/x) = T if and only if t is in [T*x, T*x+x-1],
    # we deduce that a[j] must lie in the interval [T*x, T*x+x-1].
    #
    # Also, we require a[j] >= L.
    # So for each lower bound L we look for values in the interval:
    #   [max(L, T*x), T*x+x-1]
    # among a[j] with index j such that j is not less than i.
    #
    # However, note that when a[i] equals a[j] for i != j, both orders (i, j)
    # and (j, i) satisfy a[i] <= a[j] (since they are equal). In our iteration,
    # if we count only j such that j >= i we count each equal pair once.
    # To account for the reverse ordering (j, i) for equal numbers,
    # we add an extra count for every group of equal numbers v if the pair [v,v]

    # by x is 1 if v % x == 0, otherwise it is 0.
    # Thus, if (v % x == 0 and k == 1) or (v % x != 0 and k == 0),

Every time he starts brooding he can no longer fully concentrate and repeatedly presses the keys that need to be pressed only once. For example, instead of the phrase ""how are you"" he can type ""hhoow aaaare yyoouu"". 

Polycarp decided to automate the process of correcting such errors. He decided to write a plug-in to the text editor that will remove pairs of identical consecutive letters (if there are any in the text). Of course, this is not exactly what Polycarp needs, but he's got to start from something! 

Help Polycarp and write the main plug-in module. Your program should remove from a string all pairs of identical letters, which are consecutive. If after the removal there appear new pairs, the program should remove them as well. Technically, its work should be equivalent to the following: while the string contains a pair of consecutive identical letters, the pair should be deleted. Note that deleting of the consecutive identical letters can be done in any order, as any order leads to the same result.",The input data consists of a single line to be processed.

The education is not easy because you need to have fundamental knowledge in different areas, which sometimes are not related to each other. 

For example, you should know linguistics very well. You learn a structure of Reberland language as foreign language. In this language words are constructed according to the following rules. First you need to choose the ""root"" of the word — some string which has more than 4 letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3 symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction —  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row. All these strings are considered to be suffixes of the word (this time we use word ""suffix"" to describe a morpheme but not the few last characters of the string as you may used to). 

Here is one exercise that you have found in your task list. You are given the word *s*. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language. 

Two strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match. 

Let's look at the example: the word *abacabaca* is given. This word can be obtained in the following ways: , where the root of the word is overlined, and suffixes are marked by ""corners"". Thus, the set of possible suffixes for this word is {*aca*,<=*ba*,<=*ca*}.",The only line contains a string *s* (5<=≤<=|*s*|<=≤<=104) consisting of lowercase English letters.,"On the first line print integer *k* — a number of distinct possible suffixes.

The grandmother has a large garden, which can be represented as a rectangle 1<=×<=*n* in size, when viewed from above. This rectangle is divided into *n* equal square sections. The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.

Creating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section. At that, the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section. That is, for example, the garden can be represented by a 1<=×<=5 rectangle, where the section heights are equal to 4, 2, 3, 3, 2. Then if we create an artificial rain over any of the sections with the height of 3, the water will flow over all the sections, except the ones with the height of 4. See the illustration of this example at the picture:

As Petya is keen on programming, he decided to find such a section that if we create artificial rain above it, the number of watered sections will be maximal.

    # So we choose d (a power of 3, since coins available are 1, 3, 9, 27, …)
    # such that d does NOT divide n. Moreover, if the buyer has coins all of value d,
    # then the smallest number of coins needed to pay at least n is ceil(n/d).
    # To maximize the number of coins used, we want to force the buyer to use as many coins as possible,
    # which happens when d is as small as possible (subject to d not dividing n).
    #
    # Since 1 always divides n, we start with d=3 (i.e. 3^1) and look for the smallest power of 3 that does not divide n.

39,G,Inverse Function,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Petya wrote a programme on C++ that calculated a very interesting function *f*(*n*). Petya ran the program with a certain value of *n* and went to the kitchen to have some tea. The history has no records concerning how long the program had been working. By the time Petya returned, it had completed the calculations and had the result. However while Petya was drinking tea, a sly virus managed to destroy the input file so that Petya can't figure out for which value of *n* the program was run. Help Petya, carry out the inverse function!

Mostly, the program consists of a function in C++ with the following simplified syntax:
 -  *function* ::= int f(int n) {*operatorSequence*}-  *operatorSequence* ::= *operator* | *operator* *operatorSequence*-  *operator* ::= return *arithmExpr*; | if (*logicalExpr*) return *arithmExpr*;-  *logicalExpr* ::= *arithmExpr*<=&gt;<=*arithmExpr* | *arithmExpr*<=&lt;<=*arithmExpr* | *arithmExpr* == *arithmExpr*-  *arithmExpr* ::= *sum*-  *sum* ::= *product* | *sum*<=+<=*product* | *sum*<=-<=*product*-  *product* ::= *multiplier* | *product*<=*<=*multiplier* | *product*<=/<=*multiplier*-  *multiplier* ::= n | *number* | f(*arithmExpr*)-  *number* ::= 0|1|2|... |32767 
The whitespaces in a *operatorSequence* are optional.

Thus, we have a function, in which body there are two kinds of operators. There is the operator ""return *arithmExpr*;"" that returns the value of the expression as the value of the function, and there is the conditional operator ""if (*logicalExpr*) return *arithmExpr*;"" that returns the value of the arithmetical expression when and only when the logical expression is true. Guaranteed that no other constructions of C++ language — cycles, assignment operators, nested conditional operators etc, and other variables except the *n* parameter are used in the function. All the constants are integers in the interval [0..32767].

The operators are performed sequentially. After the function has returned a value other operators in the sequence are not performed. Arithmetical expressions are performed taking into consideration the standard priority of the operations. It means that first all the products that are part of the sum are calculated. During the calculation of the products the operations of multiplying and division are performed from the left to the right. Then the summands are summed, and the addition and the subtraction are also performed from the left to the right. Operations ""&gt;"" (more), ""&lt;"" (less) and ""=="" (equals) also have standard meanings.

Now you've got to pay close attention! The program is compiled with the help of 15-bit Berland C++ compiler invented by a Berland company BerSoft, that's why arithmetical operations are performed in a non-standard way. Addition, subtraction and multiplication are performed modulo 32768 (if the result of subtraction is negative, then 32768 is added to it until the number belongs to the interval [0..32767]). Division ""/"" is a usual integer division where the remainder is omitted.

Examples of arithmetical operations: 

Guaranteed that for all values of *n* from 0 to 32767 the given function is performed correctly. That means that:

1. Division by 0 never occures.

2. When performing a function for the value *n*<==<=*N* recursive calls of the function *f* may occur only for the parameter value of 0,<=1,<=...,<=*N*<=-<=1. Consequently, the program never has an infinite recursion.

3. As the result of the sequence of the operators, the function always returns a value.

We have to mention that due to all the limitations the value returned by the function *f* is independent from either global variables or the order of performing the calculations of arithmetical expressions as part of the logical one, or from anything else except the value of *n* parameter. That's why the *f* function can be regarded as a function in its mathematical sense, i.e. as a unique correspondence between any value of *n* from the interval [0..32767] and a value of *f*(*n*) from the same interval.

Given the value of *f*(*n*), and you should find *n*. If the suitable *n* value is not unique, you should find the maximal one (from the interval [0..32767]).","The first line has an integer *f*(*n*) from the interval [0..32767].

177,F1,Script Generation,PROGRAMMING,[],"The Smart Beaver from ABBYY was offered a job of a screenwriter for the ongoing TV series. In particular, he needs to automate the hard decision: which main characters will get married by the end of the series.

There are *n* single men and *n* single women among the main characters. An opinion poll showed that viewers like several couples, and a marriage of any of them will make the audience happy. The Smart Beaver formalized this fact as *k* triples of numbers (*h*,<=*w*,<=*r*), where *h* is the index of the man, *w* is the index of the woman, and *r* is the measure of the audience's delight in case of the marriage of this couple. The same poll showed that the marriage of any other couple will leave the audience indifferent, so the screenwriters decided not to include any such marriages in the plot.

The script allows you to arrange several marriages between the heroes or not to arrange marriages at all. A subset of some of the *k* marriages is considered acceptable if each man and each woman is involved in at most one marriage of the subset (the series won't allow any divorces). The value of the acceptable set of marriages is the total delight the spectators will get from the marriages included in this set.

Obviously, there is a finite number of acceptable sets, and they all describe some variants of the script. The screenwriters do not want to choose a set with maximum value — it would make the plot too predictable. So the Smart Beaver offers the following option: sort all the acceptable sets in increasing order of value and choose the *t*-th set from the sorted list. Thus, *t*<==<=1 corresponds to a plot without marriages, *t*<==<=2 — to a single marriage resulting in minimal delight for the audience, and so on.

Help the Beaver to implement the algorithm for selecting the desired set.","The first input line contains integers *n*, *k* and *t* (1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=*min*(100,<=*n*2), 1<=≤<=*t*<=≤<=2·105), separated by single spaces.

It is guaranteed that the input data is correct: *t* doesn't exceed the total number of acceptable sets, and each pair (*h*,<=*w*) is present in at most one triple.

455,C,Civilization,PROGRAMMING,"['dfs and similar', 'dp', 'dsu', 'ternary search', 'trees']","Andrew plays a game called ""Civilization"". Dima helps him.

The game has *n* cities and *m* bidirectional roads. The cities are numbered from 1 to *n*. Between any pair of cities there either is a single (unique) path, or there is no path at all. A path is such a sequence of distinct cities *v*1,<=*v*2,<=...,<=*v**k*, that there is a road between any contiguous cities *v**i* and *v**i*<=+<=1 (1<=≤<=*i*<=&lt;<=*k*). The length of the described path equals to (*k*<=-<=1). We assume that two cities lie in the same region if and only if, there is a path connecting these two cities.

During the game events of two types take place:
 1.  Andrew asks Dima about the length of the longest path in the region where city *x* lies. 1.  Andrew asks Dima to merge the region where city *x* lies with the region where city *y* lies. If the cities lie in the same region, then no merging is needed. Otherwise, you need to merge the regions as follows: choose a city from the first region, a city from the second region and connect them by a road so as to minimize the length of the longest path in the resulting region. If there are multiple ways to do so, you are allowed to choose any of them. 
Dima finds it hard to execute Andrew's queries, so he asks you to help him. Help Dima.","The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *q* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=3·105; 0<=≤<=*m*<=&lt;<=*n*; 1<=≤<=*q*<=≤<=3·105) — the number of cities, the number of the roads we already have and the number of queries, correspondingly.

Each of the following *m* lines contains two integers, *a**i* and *b**i* (*a**i*<=≠<=*b**i*; 1<=≤<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=≤<=*n*). These numbers represent the road between cities *a**i* and *b**i*. There can be at most one road between two cities.

Each of the following *q* lines contains one of the two events in the following format:
 -  1 *x**i*. It is the request Andrew gives to Dima to find the length of the maximum path in the region that contains city *x**i* (1<=≤<=*x**i*<=≤<=*n*).  2 *x**i* *y**i*. It is the request Andrew gives to Dima to merge the region that contains city *x**i* and the region that contains city *y**i* (1<=≤<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=≤<=*n*).

This results in the new version. It is possible that some of these letters do no occur in the string. It may also happen that *x**i* coincides with *y**i*.

44,H,Phone Number,PROGRAMMING,['dp'],"Alas, finding one's true love is not easy. Masha has been unsuccessful in that yet. Her friend Dasha told Masha about a way to determine the phone number of one's Prince Charming through arithmancy. 

The phone number is divined like that. First one needs to write down one's own phone numbers. For example, let's suppose that Masha's phone number is 12345. After that one should write her favorite digit from 0 to 9 under the first digit of her number. That will be the first digit of the needed number. For example, Masha's favorite digit is 9. The second digit is determined as a half sum of the second digit of Masha's number and the already written down first digit from her beloved one's number. In this case the arithmetic average equals to (2<=+<=9)<=/<=2<==<=5.5. Masha can round the number up or down, depending on her wishes. For example, she chooses the digit 5. Having written down the resulting digit under the second digit of her number, Masha moves to finding the third digit in the same way, i.e. finding the half sum the the third digit of her number and the second digit of the new number. The result is (5<=+<=3)<=/<=2<==<=4. In this case the answer is unique. Thus, every *i*-th digit is determined as an arithmetic average of the *i*-th digit of Masha's number and the *i*<=-<=1-th digit of her true love's number. If needed, the digit can be rounded up or down. For example, Masha can get:",The first line contains nonempty sequence consisting of digits from 0 to 9 — Masha's phone number.

As the extreme archers (i.e. archers numbered 1 and *n*) are very far, the fire ball cannot reach them. Polycarp can hit any other archer with his fire ball.

The amount of health points for each archer is known. An archer will be killed when this amount is less than 0. What is the minimum amount of spells Polycarp can use to kill all the enemies?

Aside from loving sweet things, thieves from this area are known to be very greedy. So after a thief takes his number of chocolates for himself, the next thief will take exactly *k* times more than the previous one. The value of *k* (*k*<=&gt;<=1) is a secret integer known only to them. It is also known that each thief's bag can carry at most *n* chocolates (if they intend to take more, the deal is cancelled) and that there were exactly four thieves involved. 

Sadly, only the thieves know the value of *n*, but rumours say that the numbers of ways they could have taken the chocolates (for a fixed *n*, but not fixed *k*) is *m*. Two ways are considered different if one of the thieves (they should be numbered in the order they take chocolates) took different number of chocolates in them.

Mike want to track the thieves down, so he wants to know what their bags are and value of *n* will help him in that. Please find the smallest possible value of *n* or tell him that the rumors are false and there is no such *n*.","The single line of input contains the integer *m* (1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=1015) — the number of ways the thieves might steal the chocolates, as rumours say.","Print the only integer *n* — the maximum amount of chocolates that thieves' bags can carry.

Pari and Arya have won a great undirected graph as an award in a team contest. Now they have to split it in two parts, but both of them want their parts of the graph to be a vertex cover.

They have agreed to give you their graph and you need to find two disjoint subsets of its vertices *A* and *B*, such that both *A* and *B* are vertex cover or claim it's impossible.

Each of the next *m* lines contains a pair of integers *u**i* and *v**i* (1<=<=≤<=<=*u**i*,<=<=*v**i*<=<=≤<=<=*n*), denoting an undirected edge between *u**i* and *v**i*.

""But these blends are at their best, aren't they?"" Absorbed in the landscape, Kanno remains optimistic. 

The landscape can be expressed as a row of consecutive cells, each of which either contains a flower of colour amber or buff or canary yellow, or is empty.

When a flower withers, it disappears from the cell that it originally belonged to, and it spreads petals of its colour in its two neighbouring cells (or outside the field if the cell is on the side of the landscape). In case petals fall outside the given cells, they simply become invisible.

You are to help Kanno determine whether it's possible that after some (possibly none or all) flowers shed their petals, at least one of the cells contains all three colours, considering both petals and flowers. Note that flowers can wither in arbitrary order.","The first and only line of input contains a non-empty string $s$ consisting of uppercase English letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and characters '.'

1000,B,Light It Up,PROGRAMMING,['greedy'],"Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are ""lights on"" and ""lights off""). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.

The lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.

The lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.

Since you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.

Find such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.","First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$, $2 \le M \le 10^9$) — the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.

Second line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) — initially installed program $a$.",Print the only integer — maximum possible total time when the lamp is lit.,"['3 10\n4 6 7\n', '2 12\n1 10\n', '2 7\n3 4\n']","['8\n', '9\n', '6\n']","In the first example, one of possible optimal solutions is to insert value $x = 3$ before $a_1$, so program will be $[3, 4, 6, 7]$ and time of lamp being lit equals $(3 - 0) + (6 - 4) + (10 - 7) = 8$. Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.

In the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.

In the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$.",WRONG_ANSWER,"# template begins

46,A,Ball Game,PROGRAMMING,"['brute force', 'implementation']","A kindergarten teacher Natalia Pavlovna has invented a new ball game. This game not only develops the children's physique, but also teaches them how to count. 

The game goes as follows. Kids stand in circle. Let's agree to think of the children as numbered with numbers from 1 to *n* clockwise and the child number 1 is holding the ball. First the first child throws the ball to the next one clockwise, i.e. to the child number 2. Then the child number 2 throws the ball to the next but one child, i.e. to the child number 4, then the fourth child throws the ball to the child that stands two children away from him, i.e. to the child number 7, then the ball is thrown to the child who stands 3 children away from the child number 7, then the ball is thrown to the child who stands 4 children away from the last one, and so on. It should be mentioned that when a ball is thrown it may pass the beginning of the circle. For example, if *n*<==<=5, then after the third throw the child number 2 has the ball again. Overall, *n*<=-<=1 throws are made, and the game ends.

The problem is that not all the children get the ball during the game. If a child doesn't get the ball, he gets very upset and cries until Natalia Pavlovna gives him a candy. That's why Natalia Pavlovna asks you to help her to identify the numbers of the children who will get the ball after each throw.",The first line contains integer *n* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100) which indicates the number of kids in the circle.,In the single line print *n*<=-<=1 numbers which are the numbers of children who will get the ball after each throw.

Unfortunately, he does not remember the exact amount of his deputies, but he remembers that the desk of each his deputy is adjacent to his own desk, that is to say, the two desks (President's and each deputy's) have a common side of a positive length.

The office-room plan can be viewed as a matrix with *n* rows and *m* columns. Each cell of this matrix is either empty, or contains a part of a desk. An uppercase Latin letter stands for each desk colour. The «period» character («.») stands for an empty cell.","The first line contains two separated by a space integer numbers *n*, *m* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=100) — the length and the width of the office-room, and *c* character — the President's desk colour.

It is guaranteed that the colour of each desk is unique, and each desk represents a continuous subrectangle of the given matrix.

He had to win at least one more time, but the losestreak only grew longer and longer... It's no wonder he didn't get any sleep this night at all.

In the morning, Vasya was waiting the bus to the university on the bus stop. Vasya's thoughts were hazy and so he couldn't remember the right bus' number quite right and got onto the bus with the number $n$.

In the bus, Vasya thought that he could get the order of the digits in the number of the bus wrong. Futhermore, he could ""see"" some digits several times, but the digits he saw were definitely in the real number of the bus. For example, if Vasya saw the number 2028, it could mean that the real bus number could be 2028, 8022, 2820 or just 820. However, numbers 80, 22208, 52 definitely couldn't be the number of the bus.

99,A,Help Far Away Kingdom,PROGRAMMING,['strings'],"In a far away kingdom lived the King, the Prince, the Shoemaker, the Dressmaker and many other citizens. They lived happily until great trouble came into the Kingdom. The ACMers settled there.

Most damage those strange creatures inflicted upon the kingdom was that they loved high precision numbers. As a result, the Kingdom healers had already had three appointments with the merchants who were asked to sell, say, exactly 0.273549107 beer barrels. To deal with the problem somehow, the King issued an order obliging rounding up all numbers to the closest integer to simplify calculations. Specifically, the order went like this:
-  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is strictly less than 0.5, then the rounded up number coincides with the number’s integer part. -  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is not less than 0.5, the rounded up number is obtained if we add 1 to the last digit of the number’s integer part.-  If the number’s integer part ends with digit 9, to round up the numbers one should go to Vasilisa the Wise. In the whole Kingdom she is the only one who can perform the tricky operation of carrying into the next position. 
Merchants found the algorithm very sophisticated and they asked you (the ACMers) to help them. Can you write a program that would perform the rounding according to the King’s order?","The first line contains a single number to round up — the integer part (a non-empty set of decimal digits that do not start with 0 — with the exception of a case when the set consists of a single digit — in this case 0 can go first), then follows character «.» (a dot), and then follows the fractional part (any non-empty set of decimal digits). The number's length does not exceed 1000 characters, including the dot. There are no other characters in the input data.","If the last number of the integer part is not equal to 9, print the rounded-up number without leading zeroes. Otherwise, print the message ""GOTO Vasilisa.""

They were quite dear to him and the boy didn't want to throw them away. Petya conjured a cunning plan: he will glue all the spiders together and attach them to the ceiling. Besides, Petya knows that the lower the spiders will hang, the more mum is going to like it and then she won't throw his favourite toys away. Help Petya carry out the plan.

A spider consists of *k* beads tied together by *k*<=-<=1 threads. Each thread connects two different beads, at that any pair of beads that make up a spider is either directly connected by a thread, or is connected via some chain of threads and beads.

Petya may glue spiders together directly gluing their beads. The length of each thread equals 1. The sizes of the beads can be neglected. That's why we can consider that gluing spiders happens by identifying some of the beads (see the picture). Besides, the construction resulting from the gluing process should also represent a spider, that is, it should have the given features. 

After Petya glues all spiders together, he measures the length of the resulting toy. The distance between a pair of beads is identified as the total length of the threads that connect these two beads. The length of the resulting construction is the largest distance between all pairs of beads. Petya wants to make the spider whose length is as much as possible.

198,B,Jumping on Walls,PROGRAMMING,['shortest paths'],"Vasya plays a computer game with ninjas. At this stage Vasya's ninja should get out of a deep canyon.

The canyon consists of two vertical parallel walls, their height is *n* meters. Let's imagine that we split these walls into 1 meter-long areas and number them with positive integers from 1 to *n* from bottom to top. Some areas are safe and the ninja can climb them. Others are spiky and ninja can't be there. Let's call such areas dangerous.

Initially the ninja is on the lower area of the left wall. He can use each second to perform one of the following actions: 
 -  climb one area up; -  climb one area down; -  jump to the opposite wall. That gets the ninja to the area that is exactly *k* meters higher than the area he jumped from. More formally, if before the jump the ninja is located at area *x* of one wall, then after the jump he is located at area *x*<=+<=*k* of the other wall. 
If at some point of time the ninja tries to get to an area with a number larger than *n*, then we can assume that the ninja got out of the canyon.

The canyon gets flooded and each second the water level raises one meter. Initially the water level is at the lower border of the first area. Ninja cannot be on the area covered by water. We can assume that the ninja and the water ""move in turns"" — first the ninja performs some action, then the water raises for one meter, then the ninja performs one more action and so on.

The level is considered completed if the ninja manages to get out of the canyon.

After several failed attempts Vasya started to doubt whether it is possible to complete the level at all. Help him answer the question.","The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*k*<=≤<=105) — the height of the canyon and the height of ninja's jump, correspondingly.

The second line contains the description of the left wall — a string with the length of *n* characters. The *i*-th character represents the state of the *i*-th wall area: character ""X"" represents a dangerous area and character ""-"" represents a safe area.

The third line describes the right wall in the same format.

Then *n* lines follow. The *i*-th line contains three integers — the *x**i* and *y**i* coordinate values of the *i*-th location and the number *k**i* of people in it (1<=≤<=*k**i*<=&lt;<=106).

The length of some string *s* is denoted |*s*|. The Hamming distance between two strings *s* and *t* of equal length is defined as , where *s**i* is the *i*-th character of *s* and *t**i* is the *i*-th character of *t*.

180,C,Letter,PROGRAMMING,['dp'],"Patrick has just finished writing a message to his sweetheart Stacey when he noticed that the message didn't look fancy. Patrick was nervous while writing the message, so some of the letters there were lowercase and some of them were uppercase.

Patrick believes that a message is fancy if any uppercase letter stands to the left of any lowercase one. In other words, this rule describes the strings where first go zero or more uppercase letters, and then — zero or more lowercase letters.

To make the message fancy, Patrick can erase some letter and add the same letter in the same place in the opposite case (that is, he can replace an uppercase letter with the lowercase one and vice versa). Patrick got interested in the following question: what minimum number of actions do we need to make a message fancy? Changing a letter's case in the message counts as one action. Patrick cannot perform any other actions.",The only line of the input contains a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters.

The other guard guards the safe *c* so that *c*<=&gt;<=*a*, i.e. he is to the right of Oleg.

The two guards are very lazy, so they do not move. In every second, Oleg can either take all the banknotes from the current safe or move to any of the neighboring safes.

Mishka has 3 garlands.
When switched on, the i-th garland with period k_i and switched on at time x_i
will be lit exactly at times:
    x_i, x_i + k_i, x_i + 2*k_i, …
Mishka wants to choose x1, x2, x3 so that, after time T = max(x1,x2,x3),
every second t (t >= T) is covered by at least one garland.
This is equivalent to finding residues r1, r2, r3 (with r_i in [0, k_i))
such that the union of the sets:
    S1 = { t in Z : t ≡ r1 (mod k1) }
    S2 = { t in Z : t ≡ r2 (mod k2) }
    S3 = { t in Z : t ≡ r3 (mod k3) }
covers all integers.
Since we can shift time arbitrarily, we fix r1=0.
The eventual pattern (for t >= T) is periodic with period L = lcm(k1, k2, k3).
In one period there are exactly L/k_i values from garland i.
Thus by inclusion–exclusion the union covers all L residues if and only if:
    L/k1 + L/k2 + L/k3 – I12 – I13 – I23 + I123 = L,
where for example I12 is the number of t modulo L satisfying t ≡ 0 (mod k1)
and t ≡ r2 (mod k2). By the Chinese remainder theorem, such an intersection is
nonempty if and only if 0 ≡ r2 (mod gcd(k1, k2)), and then its size is L / lcm(k1, k2).
A similar reasoning applies to I13 and I23.
Finally, I123 = 1 if all three congruences are simultaneously consistent;
otherwise it is 0.
We try all possible choices of r2 (in [0, k2)) and r3 (in [0, k3)).
If any such pair leads to complete coverage of Z/L, we output ""YES"",
otherwise ""NO"".

686,A,Free Ice Cream,PROGRAMMING,"['constructive algorithms', 'implementation']","After their adventure with the magic mirror Kay and Gerda have returned home and sometimes give free ice cream to kids in the summer.

At the start of the day they have *x* ice cream packs. Since the ice cream is free, people start standing in the queue before Kay and Gerda's house even in the night. Each person in the queue wants either to take several ice cream packs for himself and his friends or to give several ice cream packs to Kay and Gerda (carriers that bring ice cream have to stand in the same queue).

If a carrier with *d* ice cream packs comes to the house, then Kay and Gerda take all his packs. If a child who wants to take *d* ice cream packs comes to the house, then Kay and Gerda will give him *d* packs if they have enough ice cream, otherwise the child will get no ice cream at all and will leave in distress.

Kay wants to find the amount of ice cream they will have after all people will leave from the queue, and Gerda wants to find the number of distressed kids.","The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *x* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=1000, 0<=≤<=*x*<=≤<=109).

Each of the next *n* lines contains a character '+' or '-', and an integer *d**i*, separated by a space (1<=≤<=*d**i*<=≤<=109). Record ""+ *d**i*"" in *i*-th line means that a carrier with *d**i* ice cream packs occupies *i*-th place from the start of the queue, and record ""- *d**i*"" means that a child who wants to take *d**i* packs stands in *i*-th place.","Print two space-separated integers — number of ice cream packs left after all operations, and number of kids that left the house in distress.","['5 7\n+ 5\n- 10\n- 20\n+ 40\n- 20\n', '5 17\n- 16\n- 2\n- 98\n+ 100\n- 98\n']","['22 1\n', '3 2\n']","Consider the first sample.

7,A,Kalevitch and Chess,PROGRAMMING,"['brute force', 'constructive algorithms']","A famous Berland's painter Kalevitch likes to shock the public. One of his last obsessions is chess. For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards.

As before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8<=×<=8 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke.

Kalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client's requirements.

It goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything — for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's needs. You are asked to help Kalevitch with this task.","The input file contains 8 lines, each of the lines contains 8 characters. The given matrix describes the client's requirements, W character stands for a white square, and B character — for a square painted black.

It is guaranteed that client's requirments can be fulfilled with a sequence of allowed strokes (vertical/column or horizontal/row).",Output the only number — the minimum amount of rows and columns that Kalevitch has to paint on the white chessboard to meet the client's requirements.,"['WWWBWWBW\nBBBBBBBB\nWWWBWWBW\nWWWBWWBW\nWWWBWWBW\nWWWBWWBW\nWWWBWWBW\nWWWBWWBW\n', 'WWWWWWWW\nBBBBBBBB\nWWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWWW\n']","['3\n', '1\n']",none,COMPILATION_ERROR,"#include <bits/stdc++.h>

1006,C,Three Parts of the Array,PROGRAMMING,"['binary search', 'data structures', 'two pointers']","You are given an array $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$ consisting of $n$ integer numbers.

Your task is to split this array into three parts (some of which may be empty) in such a way that each element of the array belongs to exactly one of the three parts, and each of the parts forms a consecutive contiguous subsegment (possibly, empty) of the original array. 

Let the sum of elements of the first part be $sum_1$, the sum of elements of the second part be $sum_2$ and the sum of elements of the third part be $sum_3$. Among all possible ways to split the array you have to choose a way such that $sum_1 = sum_3$ and $sum_1$ is maximum possible.

More formally, if the first part of the array contains $a$ elements, the second part of the array contains $b$ elements and the third part contains $c$ elements, then:

$$sum_1 = \sum\limits_{1 \le i \le a}d_i,$$ $$sum_2 = \sum\limits_{a + 1 \le i \le a + b}d_i,$$ $$sum_3 = \sum\limits_{a + b + 1 \le i \le a + b + c}d_i.$$

The sum of an empty array is $0$.

Your task is to find a way to split the array such that $sum_1 = sum_3$ and $sum_1$ is maximum possible.","The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of elements in the array $d$.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$ ($1 \le d_i \le 10^9$) — the elements of the array $d$.","Print a single integer — the maximum possible value of $sum_1$, considering that the condition $sum_1 = sum_3$ must be met.

Obviously, at least one valid way to split the array exists (use $a=c=0$ and $b=n$).","['5\n1 3 1 1 4\n', '5\n1 3 2 1 4\n', '3\n4 1 2\n']","['5\n', '4\n', '0\n']","In the first example there is only one possible splitting which maximizes $sum_1$: $[1, 3, 1], [~], [1, 4]$.

In the second example the only way to have $sum_1=4$ is: $[1, 3], [2, 1], [4]$.

Patrick believes that a message is fancy if any uppercase letter stands to the left of any lowercase one. In other words, this rule describes the strings where first go zero or more uppercase letters, and then — zero or more lowercase letters.

To make the message fancy, Patrick can erase some letter and add the same letter in the same place in the opposite case (that is, he can replace an uppercase letter with the lowercase one and vice versa). Patrick got interested in the following question: what minimum number of actions do we need to make a message fancy? Changing a letter's case in the message counts as one action. Patrick cannot perform any other actions.",The only line of the input contains a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters.

1006,E,Military Problem,PROGRAMMING,"['dfs and similar', 'graphs', 'trees']","In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.

There are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.

Officer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:
 -  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$; -  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. 
For example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.

The structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.

Formally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.

Berland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.

To process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.

Suppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ — one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.

Let's look at the following example:

If officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.

If officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.

If officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.

If officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.

To answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.

You should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.","The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.

The second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \dots, p_n$ ($1 \le p_i &lt; i$), where $p_i$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $i$. The commander has index $1$ and doesn't have any superiors.

The next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query is given as a pair ($u_i, k_i$) ($1 \le u_i, k_i \le n$), where $u_i$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $k_i$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence.","Print $q$ numbers, where the $i$-th number is the officer at the position $k_i$ in the list which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if it starts spreading from officer $u_i$. Print ""-1"" if the number of officers which receive the command is less than $k_i$.

690,C1,Brain Network (easy),PROGRAMMING,[],"One particularly well-known fact about zombies is that they move and think terribly slowly. While we still don't know why their movements are so sluggish, the problem of laggy thinking has been recently resolved. It turns out that the reason is not (as previously suspected) any kind of brain defect – it's the opposite! Independent researchers confirmed that the nervous system of a zombie is highly complicated – it consists of *n* brains (much like a cow has several stomachs). They are interconnected by brain connectors, which are veins capable of transmitting thoughts between brains. There are two important properties such a brain network should have to function properly: 
 1.  It should be possible to exchange thoughts between any two pairs of brains (perhaps indirectly, through other brains). 1.  There should be no redundant brain connectors, that is, removing any brain connector would make property 1 false. 
If both properties are satisfied, we say that the nervous system is valid. Unfortunately (?), if the system is not valid, the zombie stops thinking and becomes (even more) dead. Your task is to analyze a given nervous system of a zombie and find out whether it is valid.","The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=1000) denoting the number of brains (which are conveniently numbered from 1 to *n*) and the number of brain connectors in the nervous system, respectively. In the next *m* lines, descriptions of brain connectors follow. Every connector is given as a pair of brains *a* *b* it connects (1<=≤<=*a*,<=*b*<=≤<=*n*, *a*<=≠<=*b*).","The output consists of one line, containing either yes or no depending on whether the nervous system is valid.","['4 4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n4 1\n', '6 5\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n3 6\n']","['no\n', 'yes\n']",none,WRONG_ANSWER,"def dfs(cell):

990,D,Graph And Its Complement,PROGRAMMING,"['constructive algorithms', 'graphs', 'implementation']","Given three numbers $n, a, b$. You need to find an adjacency matrix of such an undirected graph that the number of components in it is equal to $a$, and the number of components in its complement is $b$. The matrix must be symmetric, and all digits on the main diagonal must be zeroes.

In an undirected graph loops (edges from a vertex to itself) are not allowed. It can be at most one edge between a pair of vertices.

The adjacency matrix of an undirected graph is a square matrix of size $n$ consisting only of ""0"" and ""1"", where $n$ is the number of vertices of the graph and the $i$-th row and the $i$-th column correspond to the $i$-th vertex of the graph. The cell $(i,j)$ of the adjacency matrix contains $1$ if and only if the $i$-th and $j$-th vertices in the graph are connected by an edge.

A connected component is a set of vertices $X$ such that for every two vertices from this set there exists at least one path in the graph connecting this pair of vertices, but adding any other vertex to $X$ violates this rule.

The complement or inverse of a graph $G$ is a graph $H$ on the same vertices such that two distinct vertices of $H$ are adjacent if and only if they are not adjacent in $G$.","In a single line, three numbers are given $n, a, b \,(1 \le n \le 1000, 1 \le a, b \le n)$: is the number of vertexes of the graph, the required number of connectivity components in it, and the required amount of the connectivity component in it's complement.","If there is no graph that satisfies these constraints on a single line, print ""NO"" (without quotes).

Otherwise, on the first line, print ""YES""(without quotes). In each of the next $n$ lines, output $n$ digits such that $j$-th digit of $i$-th line must be $1$ if and only if there is an edge between vertices $i$ and $j$ in $G$ (and $0$ otherwise). Note that the matrix must be symmetric, and all digits on the main diagonal must be zeroes.

This script computes the maximum profit (product of lengths) for repairing two disjoint paths in a tree.
A path's length is defined as its number of roads (edges). The two paths must not share any city.
The key observation is that for any two disjoint connected subtrees there exists an edge whose removal
separates the tree into two connected components. The maximum possible path in each component is simply the
diameter (maximum distance between any two vertices) of that component. Thus, we can try “cutting”
each edge in the tree and compute the product of the two diameters of the resulting components.

Once in summer Peter was going by train from city A to city B, and as usual, was sleeping. Then he woke up, started to look through the window and noticed that every railway station has a flag of a particular colour.

The boy started to memorize the order of the flags' colours that he had seen. But soon he fell asleep again. Unfortunately, he didn't sleep long, he woke up and went on memorizing the colours. Then he fell asleep again, and that time he slept till the end of the journey.

At the station he told his parents about what he was doing, and wrote two sequences of the colours that he had seen before and after his sleep, respectively.

Peter's parents know that their son likes to fantasize. They give you the list of the flags' colours at the stations that the train passes sequentially on the way from A to B, and ask you to find out if Peter could see those sequences on the way from A to B, or from B to A. Remember, please, that Peter had two periods of wakefulness.

448,B,Suffix Structures,PROGRAMMING,"['implementation', 'strings']","Bizon the Champion isn't just a bison. He also is a favorite of the ""Bizons"" team.

At a competition the ""Bizons"" got the following problem: ""You are given two distinct words (strings of English letters), *s* and *t*. You need to transform word *s* into word *t*"". The task looked simple to the guys because they know the suffix data structures well. Bizon Senior loves suffix automaton. By applying it once to a string, he can remove from this string any single character. Bizon Middle knows suffix array well. By applying it once to a string, he can swap any two characters of this string. The guys do not know anything about the suffix tree, but it can help them do much more. 

Bizon the Champion wonders whether the ""Bizons"" can solve the problem. Perhaps, the solution do not require both data structures. Find out whether the guys can solve the problem and if they can, how do they do it? Can they solve it either only with use of suffix automaton or only with use of suffix array or they need both structures? Note that any structure may be used an unlimited number of times, the structures may be used in any order.",The first line contains a non-empty word *s*.

Print ""both"" (without the quotes), if you need both data structures to solve the problem.

We use a DFS approach.
For each node v (1-indexed), define a bitmask (an integer)
that represents the set of time offsets at which an apple leaves v.
For a non-root node v, two sources contribute:
  (1) The apple initially present in v contributes {1}.
  (2) All apples coming from its children: for each child w,
      the apples leaving w will reach v one second later,
      so we take the bitmask from w shifted left by 1.
Since apples annihilate pairwise, we perform additions modulo 2 (i.e. XOR).
For the root (node 1), we do not add its own apple because it is
collected immediately at time 0.
The final answer is 1 (the apple originally in node1)

71,A,Way Too Long Words,PROGRAMMING,['strings'],"Sometimes some words like ""localization"" or ""internationalization"" are so long that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.

Let's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly more than 10 characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.

This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.

Thus, ""localization"" will be spelt as ""l10n"", and ""internationalization» will be spelt as ""i18n"".

You are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that all too long words should be replaced by the abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any changes.",The first line contains an integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100).

The camera's memory is *d* megabytes. Valera's camera can take photos of high and low quality. One low quality photo takes *a* megabytes of memory, one high quality photo take *b* megabytes of memory. For unknown reasons, each client asks him to make several low quality photos and several high quality photos.

To make one low quality photo, the camera must have at least *a* megabytes of free memory space. Similarly, to make one high quality photo, the camera must have at least *b* megabytes of free memory space. Initially the camera's memory is empty.

61,A,Ultra-Fast Mathematician,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Shapur was an extremely gifted student. He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.

One day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.

In his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.

Shapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length ∞ (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.

Now you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.",There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number.

883,F,Lost in Transliteration,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"There are some ambiguities when one writes Berland names with the letters of the Latin alphabet.

For example, the Berland sound u can be written in the Latin alphabet as ""u"", and can be written as ""oo"". For this reason, two words ""ulyana"" and ""oolyana"" denote the same name.

The second ambiguity is about the Berland sound h: one can use both ""h"" and ""kh"" to write it. For example, the words ""mihail"" and ""mikhail"" denote the same name.

There are *n* users registered on the Polycarp's website. Each of them indicated a name represented by the Latin letters. How many distinct names are there among them, if two ambiguities described above are taken into account?

Formally, we assume that two words denote the same name, if using the replacements ""u""  ""oo"" and ""h""  ""kh"", you can make the words equal. One can make replacements in both directions, in any of the two words an arbitrary number of times. A letter that resulted from the previous replacement can participate in the next replacements.

For example, the following pairs of words denote the same name:
 -  ""koouper"" and ""kuooper"". Making the replacements described above, you can make both words to be equal: ""koouper""  ""kuuper"" and ""kuooper""  ""kuuper"". -  ""khun"" and ""kkkhoon"". With the replacements described above you can make both words to be equal: ""khun""  ""khoon"" and ""kkkhoon""  ""kkhoon""  ""khoon"".

Karen’s Grocery Problem

Karen wants to purchase as many goods as possible without exceeding her budget b.
Each good i has a cost c[i], and if she uses its coupon, it subtracts d[i] from the cost.
However, for goods i>=2, to use its coupon discount, she must also use the coupon
for good x[i] (with x[i] < i). Buying an item without coupon is always allowed.

The strategy is to choose a subset of goods and decide, for each chosen good, whether
to use the discount or not. The discount option is only available for a good u if:
 - Either u is the root (first good) or,
 - u's dependency (parent) was purchased with a coupon discount.
Since discount always reduces cost (c[u]-d[u] <= c[u]),
if the discount option is available for a chosen good, it is preferable to use it.
However, using the discount on a good forces its ancestors in that discount chain to also use coupons.

We solve the problem by doing a tree DP over the dependency tree.
For each node u, we define a function solve_node(u, allowed) which returns a list dp,
where dp[k] is the minimum cost to pick exactly k goods from the subtree of u.
The parameter allowed indicates whether u is allowed to be purchased at discount.
If allowed is True then u can be purchased with a coupon (discount option),
otherwise u must be purchased full‐price.

For each node u, there are three options:
  0) Do not pick u. Then process its children independently,
     with discount option unavailable (allowed = False) since u wasn’t bought.
  1) Pick u full price (cost = c[u]). Then children are processed with allowed = False.
  2) If allowed is True, pick u with discount (cost = c[u] - d[u]).
     Then children are processed with allowed = True.
We merge the results of the children using standard knapSack style convolution.

Finally, we compute the DP for the whole tree (root 0, with discount allowed).
The answer is the maximum k such that dp[k] <= b.

980,C,Posterized,PROGRAMMING,"['games', 'greedy']","Professor Ibrahim has prepared the final homework for his algorithm’s class. He asked his students to implement the Posterization Image Filter.

Their algorithm will be tested on an array of integers, where the $i$-th integer represents the color of the $i$-th pixel in the image. The image is in black and white, therefore the color of each pixel will be an integer between 0 and 255 (inclusive).

To implement the filter, students are required to divide the black and white color range [0, 255] into groups of consecutive colors, and select one color in each group to be the group’s key. In order to preserve image details, the size of a group must not be greater than $k$, and each color should belong to exactly one group.

Finally, the students will replace the color of each pixel in the array with that color’s assigned group key.

To better understand the effect, here is an image of a basking turtle where the Posterization Filter was applied with increasing $k$ to the right. 

To make the process of checking the final answer easier, Professor Ibrahim wants students to divide the groups and assign the keys in a way that produces the lexicographically smallest possible array.","The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^5$, $1 \leq k \leq 256$), the number of pixels in the image, and the maximum size of a group, respectively.

Let us remind you the rules of moving chess pieces. A chessboard is 64 square fields organized into an 8<=×<=8 table. A field is represented by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*) — the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:
 -  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically. -  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally. -  A king moves one field in any direction — horizontally, vertically or diagonally. 
Petya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2)? At that, we assume that there are no more pieces besides this one on the board. Help him solve this problem.","The input contains four integers *r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2 (1<=≤<=*r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2<=≤<=8) — the coordinates of the starting and the final field. The starting field doesn't coincide with the final one.

You can assume that the chessboard rows are numbered from top to bottom 1 through 8, and the columns are numbered from left to right 1 through 8.","Print three space-separated integers: the minimum number of moves the rook, the bishop and the king (in this order) is needed to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2).

374,A,Inna and Pink Pony,PROGRAMMING,"['greedy', 'implementation']","Dima and Inna are doing so great! At the moment, Inna is sitting on the magic lawn playing with a pink pony. Dima wanted to play too. He brought an *n*<=×<=*m* chessboard, a very tasty candy and two numbers *a* and *b*.

Dima put the chessboard in front of Inna and placed the candy in position (*i*,<=*j*) on the board. The boy said he would give the candy if it reaches one of the corner cells of the board. He's got one more condition. There can only be actions of the following types:
 -  move the candy from position (*x*,<=*y*) on the board to position (*x*<=-<=*a*,<=*y*<=-<=*b*); -  move the candy from position (*x*,<=*y*) on the board to position (*x*<=+<=*a*,<=*y*<=-<=*b*); -  move the candy from position (*x*,<=*y*) on the board to position (*x*<=-<=*a*,<=*y*<=+<=*b*); -  move the candy from position (*x*,<=*y*) on the board to position (*x*<=+<=*a*,<=*y*<=+<=*b*). 
Naturally, Dima doesn't allow to move the candy beyond the chessboard borders.

Inna and the pony started shifting the candy around the board. They wonder what is the minimum number of allowed actions that they need to perform to move the candy from the initial position (*i*,<=*j*) to one of the chessboard corners. Help them cope with the task!","The first line of the input contains six integers *n*,<=*m*,<=*i*,<=*j*,<=*a*,<=*b* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=106; 1<=≤<=*i*<=≤<=*n*; 1<=≤<=*j*<=≤<=*m*; 1<=≤<=*a*,<=*b*<=≤<=106).

You can assume that the chessboard rows are numbered from 1 to *n* from top to bottom and the columns are numbered from 1 to *m* from left to right. Position (*i*,<=*j*) in the statement is a chessboard cell on the intersection of the *i*-th row and the *j*-th column. You can consider that the corners are: (1,<=*m*), (*n*,<=1), (*n*,<=*m*), (1,<=1).","In a single line print a single integer — the minimum number of moves needed to get the candy.

Inna and the pony can move the candy to position (1 + 2, 3 + 2) = (3, 5), from there they can move it to positions (3 - 2, 5 + 2) = (1, 7) and (3 + 2, 5 + 2) = (5, 7).

This script solves the problem of forming a top‐secret troop with minimal total loquacity 
subject to a limited number of adjacent swaps. The key observation is that when soldiers 
are chosen (in order) to be in the front k positions, the cost (number of swaps) required 
to move a soldier at original index i into the j-th position (0-indexed) is (i - j). 

Thus, if we choose a subsequence of k soldiers with indices i0, i1, ..., i{k-1} (in increasing order),
the total number of swaps required is:
    (i0 - 0) + (i1 - 1) + ... + (i{k-1} - (k-1)).

We need to choose a subsequence so that the total swap cost is at most s and the total loquacity 
(sum of q-values of the chosen soldiers) is minimized.
We use dynamic programming with state:
    dp[j][cost] = minimum possible sum of loquacity when we have chosen exactly j soldiers 
    with total swap cost equal to cost.
Because n and k are small (<=150) and maximum cost per choice is bounded by k*(n-1),
we use a dictionary-based DP to only keep the reachable cost values.

We solve the problem by splitting the selection into a mandatory “baseline”
subarray covering the whole array and (k-1) extra intervals.
The total answer equals:
    baseline_sum + (sum of top (k-1) subarray sums)
where “top” means subarray sums sorted in non‐increasing order.
We use a known technique for “sum of k largest subarray sums” via binary search.
Let P[0..n] be the prefix sums of the array.
Every subarray sum = P[j] - P[i] for 0 <= i < j <= n.
For any threshold X, we can count the number of subarrays with sum >= X and 
their total sum (i.e. sum of all such subarray sums). Then, if we let T = (k-1)
and choose v as the largest integer such that the count of subarrays with sum >= v
is at least T, then the sum of the top T subarray sums equals:
    S(v) - (count(v) - T) * v,
where S(v) is the total sum of subarray sums >= v.
Finally, answer = baseline (i.e. sum(array)) + (that extra sum).
If k == 1, answer is simply baseline.
 
We use Fenwick trees (Binary Indexed Trees) for efficient queries.
Coordinate compression is applied to the prefix sums.
 
Note: Although worst-case input size may require heavy optimization in C++,
this Python implementation uses BIT and binary search – and is expected to
perform well on average test cases.

He now believes that a super spy such as Siddhant can't use a cipher as basic and ancient as Caesar cipher. After many weeks of observation of Siddhant’s sentences, Yash determined a new cipher technique.

For a given sentence, the cipher is processed as: 
 1.  Convert all letters of the sentence to lowercase. 1.  Reverse each of the words of the sentence individually. 1.  Remove all the spaces in the sentence. 
For example, when this cipher is applied to the sentence

Kira is childish and he hates losing

the resulting string is

ariksihsidlihcdnaehsetahgnisol

The clock's face can display any number from 1 to *d*. It is guaranteed that *a**i*<=≤<=*d* for all *i* from 1 to *n*. The clock does not keep information about the current month, so when a new day comes, it simply increases the current day number by one. The clock cannot display number *d*<=+<=1, so after day number *d* it shows day 1 (the current day counter resets). The mechanism of the clock allows you to increase the day number by one manually. When you execute this operation, day *d* is also followed by day 1.

Vasya begins each day checking the day number on the clock. If the day number on the clock does not match the actual day number in the current month, then Vasya manually increases it by one. Vasya is persistent and repeats this operation until the day number on the clock matches the actual number of the current day in the current month.

""""""
We are given three musketeers with strengths a, b, c (not necessarily sorted)
and n criminals with given strengths.
Each hour the musketeers may be assigned in one of two “patterns”:
  • They can all fight separately (""three singles"") which can defeat up to three criminals—
    but note that a single musketeer can defeat a criminal only if that criminal’s strength
    does not exceed his personal strength.
  • They can join forces: two musketeers may team‐up on one criminal while the third,
    unused in that fight, can fight another criminal. (In one hour such an assignment defeats 2 criminals.)
In each hour a musketeer may participate in at most one fight.
A criminal may be attacked by one, two, or all three musketeers provided that the sum
of the strengths of the assigned musketeers is at least the criminal’s strength.
Because the musketeers want a “peaceful” New Year’s Eve, we need to minimize the number
of hours required to defeat all criminals.
If any criminal is too strong to be defeated even by all three together (i.e. if t > a+b+c)
the answer is -1.

An optimal scheduling strategy is known:
  – Criminals which are “easy” (with t <= c) can be killed by a single musketeer.
  – Criminals with t > c require at least two musketeers.
When two musketeers team‐up, there are three possible pairs:
     Pair (A,B) can defeat criminals of strength <= a+b;
     Pair (A,C) can defeat criminals of strength <= a+c;
     Pair (B,C) can defeat criminals of strength <= b+c.
If a criminal (with t > c) can be defeated by a pair move (i.e. t <= some pair sum)
it is best to do so because then the “unused” musketeer in that hour
can still fight a “single‐kill” criminal.
However, if t is too high for every pair, then all three must join (a triple move)
and no extra single move is available that hour.

After “assigning” each hour for a criminal from the “t > c” group,
we get extra single–move “slots” only in those hours where a pair move was used.
On the other side,
hours in which no “group1” (criminal requiring ≥2 musketeers)
fight is scheduled (“free hours”), all three musketeers are free for single moves.
Thus we split the criminals into:
  Group1: criminals with t > c (cannot be defeated individually)
         and further into:
           • Category 1: t ≤ a+b. (Use pair (A,B) → leftover fighter C)
           • Category 2: a+b < t ≤ a+c. (Use pair (A,C) → leftover fighter B)
           • Category 3: a+c < t ≤ b+c. (Use pair (B,C) → leftover fighter A)
           • Otherwise (t > b+c) they force a triple move.
  Group2: criminals with t ≤ c (defeated by a single musketeer).

When scheduling in x hours we must assign each Group1 criminal
to its own hour. In hours where a Group1 criminal is handled by a pair move,
an extra single–move “slot” is obtained; triple moves yield no extra slot.
Also, any hour with no Group1 fight yields 3 single–move slots (one per musketeer).

We then partition the Group2 criminals by the minimum single–move “slot” needed:
  • An A–slot (from fighter with strength a) can only kill criminals with t ≤ a.
  • A B–slot (strength b) works for t ≤ b.
  • A C–slot (strength c) works for t ≤ c.
The extra slots from Group1 pair moves are “typed” according to the unused fighter:
  – Category1 pair moves yield a C–slot.
  – Category2 yield a B–slot.
  – Category3 yield an A–slot.
Adding the free hours (which contribute one slot of each type) we get:
      avail_A = free + (number from Category3)
      avail_B = free + (number from Category2)
      avail_C = free + (number from Category1)
We then test if in x hours we can assign all Group2 criminals to single–move slots.
Finally, we binary–search for the minimal feasible x.

Below is the Python implementation.

They decided to start with the name.

For this purpose the corporation has consecutively hired *m* designers.

This results in the new version. It is possible that some of these letters do no occur in the string. It may also happen that *x**i* coincides with *y**i*. The version of the name received after the work of the last designer becomes the new name of the corporation.

Manager Arkady has recently got a job in this company, but is already soaked in the spirit of teamwork and is very worried about the success of the rebranding. Naturally, he can't wait to find out what is the new name the Corporation will receive.

Vladik's Card Game Solver

We are given n cards (n <= 1000) with numbers from 1 to 8.
We need to find the longest subsequence that satisfies two conditions:
1. For every number from 1 to 8, let c_i be the number of occurrences in the subsequence.
   These counts must satisfy |c_i - c_j| <= 1 for every i, j.
2. In the subsequence, the occurrences of any number that appears must form a contiguous block.

Observation:
Any valid subsequence’s counts (c1,...,c8) are such that all counts are either x or x+1 for some x >= 0.
Indeed, if we let x = min(c_i), then for some numbers we have c_i = x+1 and for others c_i = x.
Thus, if we denote s as the number of numbers that appear (with extra one) then the total length is:
    L = 8*x + s     (with s between 0 and 8)
Note: When x == 0, only s numbers appear in the subsequence (with 1 each) and the remaining numbers have 0 count.
For x > 0, every number appears (either with x or x+1 occurrences).

Our plan:
For each candidate subsequence length L (from n down to 1), we compute
   r = L // 8 and s = L - 8*r.
Then we need to check if we can choose, for numbers 1..8, an assignment:
    - if r > 0: assign each number either r or r+1 (with exactly s bonus assignments)
    - if r == 0: choose any subset of numbers (of size s) to appear with count 1.
We then check if we can extract blocks (each block's occurrences must be in order, but not necessarily consecutive in the original sequence)
in some order (i.e. permutation of blocks) from the original sequence.

We use precomputed positions for each number and a helper function get_next() which, for a given card number and a starting position,
returns the index of the t-th occurrence (after the given position) or INF if not possible.

For checking the existence of an ordering we perform a bitmask DP over the blocks.
When r > 0 the set S is {all numbers 1..8} and we also decide per block whether we take the bonus (r+1) or regular (r) count.
When r == 0 the subset S is chosen among numbers that appear at least once.
We iterate L from n to 1 and return the first (largest) L that works.

The second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*, where each *a**i* either equals to 0 (then vertex *i* has no cat), or equals to 1 (then vertex *i* has a cat).

Let's denote *s* as the total number of cells of table *a*, that is, . We know that each cell of the table contains a single integer from 1 to *s*, at that all written integers are distinct. 

Let's assume that the cells of the *i*-th row of table *a* are numbered from 1 to *c**i*, then let's denote the number written in the *j*-th cell of the *i*-th row as *a**i*,<=*j*. Your task is to perform several swap operations to rearrange the numbers in the table so as to fulfill the following conditions:
 1.  for all *i*,<=*j* (1<=&lt;<=*i*<=≤<=*n*; 1<=≤<=*j*<=≤<=*c**i*) holds *a**i*,<=*j*<=&gt;<=*a**i*<=-<=1,<=*j*; 1.  for all *i*,<=*j* (1<=≤<=*i*<=≤<=*n*; 1<=&lt;<=*j*<=≤<=*c**i*) holds *a**i*,<=*j*<=&gt;<=*a**i*,<=*j*<=-<=1. 
In one swap operation you are allowed to choose two different cells of the table and swap the recorded there numbers, that is the number that was recorded in the first of the selected cells before the swap, is written in the second cell after it. Similarly, the number that was recorded in the second of the selected cells, is written in the first cell after the swap.

Rearrange the numbers in the required manner. Note that you are allowed to perform any number of operations, but not more than *s*. You do not have to minimize the number of operations.","The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=50) that shows the number of rows in the table. The second line contains *n* space-separated integers *c**i* (1<=≤<=*c**i*<=≤<=50; *c**i*<=≤<=*c**i*<=-<=1) — the numbers of cells on the corresponding rows.

Next *n* lines contain table *а*. The *i*-th of them contains *c**i* space-separated integers: the *j*-th integer in this line represents *a**i*,<=*j*.

It is guaranteed that all the given numbers *a**i*,<=*j* are positive and do not exceed *s*. It is guaranteed that all *a**i*,<=*j* are distinct.","In the first line print a single integer *m* (0<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=*s*), representing the number of performed swaps.

In the next *m* lines print the description of these swap operations. In the *i*-th line print four space-separated integers *x**i*,<=*y**i*,<=*p**i*,<=*q**i* (1<=≤<=*x**i*,<=*p**i*<=≤<=*n*; 1<=≤<=*y**i*<=≤<=*c**x**i*; 1<=≤<=*q**i*<=≤<=*c**p**i*).

Usually there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that’s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player wins.

He left a calculator on the floor and went to ask some money from his parents. Meanwhile his little brother Yusuf came and started to press the keys randomly. Unfortunately Max has forgotten the number which he had calculated. The only thing he knows is that the number is divisible by 4.

You are given a string *s* consisting of digits (the number on the display of the calculator after Yusuf randomly pressed the keys). Your task is to find the number of substrings which are divisible by 4. A substring can start with a zero.

A substring of a string is a nonempty sequence of consecutive characters.

For example if string *s* is 124 then we have four substrings that are divisible by 4: 12, 4, 24 and 124. For the string 04 the answer is three: 0, 4, 04.

As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use gets/scanf/printf instead of getline/cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java.",The only line contains string *s* (1<=≤<=|*s*|<=≤<=3·105).

Sergey gives Nastya the word *t* and wants to get the word *p* out of it. Nastya removes letters in a certain order (one after another, in this order strictly), which is specified by permutation of letters' indices of the word *t*: *a*1... *a*|*t*|. We denote the length of word *x* as |*x*|. Note that after removing one letter, the indices of other letters don't change. For example, if *t*<==<=""nastya"" and *a*<==<=[4,<=1,<=5,<=3,<=2,<=6] then removals make the following sequence of words ""nastya""  ""nastya""  ""nastya""  ""nastya""  ""nastya""  ""nastya""  ""nastya"".

Sergey knows this permutation. His goal is to stop his sister at some point and continue removing by himself to get the word *p*. Since Nastya likes this activity, Sergey wants to stop her as late as possible. Your task is to determine, how many letters Nastya can remove before she will be stopped by Sergey.

227,B,Effective Approach,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.

According to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.

Vasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.

To finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.

But the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.","The first line contains integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105) — the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the elements of array. 

The third line contains integer *m* (1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=105) — the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=≤<=*b**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the search queries.

This script computes the number of seconds until Vasya’s seat is served.
The airplane has infinitely many rows and a fixed pattern for flight attendants serving rows.
Each row has six seats with serving order: f, e, d, a, b, c.
Flight attendants serve rows in pairs with the following schedule:
    Pair0: rows 1 (attendant A) and 3 (attendant B) served starting at t = 0
    Pair1: rows 2 (A) and 4 (B) served starting at t = 7
    Pair2: rows 5 (A) and 7 (B) served starting at t = 16
    Pair3: rows 6 (A) and 8 (B) served starting at t = 23
    Pair4: rows 9 (A) and 11 (B) served starting at t = 32
    Pair5: rows 10 (A) and 12 (B) served starting at t = 39
    ... and so on.
The pattern for the starting time of pairs is based on alternating moves:
    After one pair is served, the flight attendants move 1 row forward (taking 1 second),
    and after the next pair they move 3 rows forward (taking 3 seconds).
Thus, pairs with even indices start at T = 16*m and pairs with odd indices start at T = 16*m + 7,
where m = pair_index//2.
For assigning rows to pairs:
    Attendant A serves rows whose last digit mod 4 is 1 or 2.
    Attendant B serves rows whose last digit mod 4 is 3 or 0.
The mapping to pair index is as follows:
    If row % 4 == 1: pair_index = 2 * ((row - 1) // 4)
    If row % 4 == 2: pair_index = 2 * ((row - 2) // 4) + 1
    If row % 4 == 3: pair_index = 2 * ((row - 3) // 4)
    If row % 4 == 0: pair_index = 2 * ((row - 4) // 4) + 1
Within the row, the seat order positions are:
    seat 'f' -> position 1
    seat 'e' -> position 2
    seat 'd' -> position 3
    seat 'a' -> position 4
    seat 'b' -> position 5
    seat 'c' -> position 6
The final answer is the sum of the start time for the serving pair and the seat order.

It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.

Now let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.

As you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. ""But why split the money equally?"" — you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.","The first line contains integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100) — the number of coins.

Mike starts by laying one magnet horizontally on the table. During each following step Mike adds one more magnet horizontally to the right end of the row.

Besides, if two students are tied, then the lace connects the first student with the second one as well as the second student with the first one.

To restore order, Anna and Maria do the following. First, for each student Anna finds out what other students he is tied to. If a student is tied to exactly one other student, Anna reprimands him. Then Maria gathers in a single group all the students who have been just reprimanded. She kicks them out from the club. This group of students immediately leaves the club. These students takes with them the laces that used to tie them. Then again for every student Anna finds out how many other students he is tied to and so on. And they do so until Anna can reprimand at least one student.

At a specific point in time, a spinner can take 4 positions shown below (each one rotated 90 degrees relative to the previous, with the fourth one followed by the first one):

After the spinner was spun, it starts its rotation, which is described by a following algorithm: the spinner maintains its position for a second then majestically switches to the next position in clockwise or counter-clockwise order, depending on the direction the spinner was spun in.

Slastyona managed to have spinner rotating for exactly *n* seconds. Being fascinated by elegance of the process, she completely forgot the direction the spinner was spun in! Lucky for her, she managed to recall the starting position, and wants to deduct the direction given the information she knows.

The round was 120 minutes long and featured five problems with maximum point values of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500, respectively. Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.

Codeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is *x*, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute *m* but made *w* wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is . His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.

It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.","The first line of the input contains five space-separated integers *m*1, *m*2, *m*3, *m*4, *m*5, where *m**i* (0<=≤<=*m**i*<=≤<=119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem *i*. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted.

The second line contains five space-separated integers *w*1, *w*2, *w*3, *w*4, *w*5, where *w**i* (0<=≤<=*w**i*<=≤<=10) is Kevin's number of wrong submissions on problem *i*.

The landscape can be expressed as a row of consecutive cells, each of which either contains a flower of colour amber or buff or canary yellow, or is empty.

When a flower withers, it disappears from the cell that it originally belonged to, and it spreads petals of its colour in its two neighbouring cells (or outside the field if the cell is on the side of the landscape). In case petals fall outside the given cells, they simply become invisible.

You are to help Kanno determine whether it's possible that after some (possibly none or all) flowers shed their petals, at least one of the cells contains all three colours, considering both petals and flowers. Note that flowers can wither in arbitrary order.","The first and only line of input contains a non-empty string $s$ consisting of uppercase English letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and characters '.'

Scrooge signs like that: first it places a pen at the point *A*1, then draws a segment from point *A*1 to point *A*2, then he draws a segment from point *A*2 to point *A*3 and so on to point *A**n*, where he stops signing and takes the pen off the paper. At that the resulting line can intersect with itself and partially repeat itself but Scrooge pays no attention to it and never changes his signing style. As Scrooge makes the signature, he never takes the pen off the paper and his writing speed is constant — 50 millimeters per second.

Scrooge signed exactly *k* papers throughout his life and all those signatures look the same.

You should also know that Limak is so young that he knows only first six letters of the English alphabet: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' and 'f'.

You are given a set of *q* possible operations. Limak can perform them in any order, any operation may be applied any number of times. The *i*-th operation is described by a string *a**i* of length two and a string *b**i* of length one. No two of *q* possible operations have the same string *a**i*.

When Limak has a string *s* he can perform the *i*-th operation on *s* if the first two letters of *s* match a two-letter string *a**i*. Performing the *i*-th operation removes first two letters of *s* and inserts there a string *b**i*. See the notes section for further clarification.

You may note that performing an operation decreases the length of a string *s* exactly by 1. Also, for some sets of operations there may be a string that cannot be compressed any further, because the first two letters don't match any *a**i*.

Limak wants to start with a string of length *n* and perform *n*<=-<=1 operations to finally get a one-letter string ""a"". In how many ways can he choose the starting string to be able to get ""a""? Remember that Limak can use only letters he knows.","The first line contains two integers *n* and *q* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=6, 1<=≤<=*q*<=≤<=36) — the length of the initial string and the number of available operations.

180,A,Defragmentation,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"In this problem you have to implement an algorithm to defragment your hard disk. The hard disk consists of a sequence of clusters, numbered by integers from 1 to *n*. The disk has *m* recorded files, the *i*-th file occupies clusters with numbers *a**i*,<=1, *a**i*,<=2, ..., *a**i*,<=*n**i*. These clusters are not necessarily located consecutively on the disk, but the order in which they are given corresponds to their sequence in the file (cluster *a**i*,<=1 contains the first fragment of the *i*-th file, cluster *a**i*,<=2 has the second fragment, etc.). Also the disc must have one or several clusters which are free from files.

You are permitted to perform operations of copying the contents of cluster number *i* to cluster number *j* (*i* and *j* must be different). Moreover, if the cluster number *j* used to keep some information, it is lost forever. Clusters are not cleaned, but after the defragmentation is complete, some of them are simply declared unusable (although they may possibly still contain some fragments of files).

Your task is to use a sequence of copy operations to ensure that each file occupies a contiguous area of memory. Each file should occupy a consecutive cluster section, the files must follow one after another from the beginning of the hard disk. After defragmentation all free (unused) clusters should be at the end of the hard disk. After defragmenting files can be placed in an arbitrary order. Clusters of each file should go consecutively from first to last. See explanatory examples in the notes.

979,C,Kuro and Walking Route,PROGRAMMING,"['dfs and similar', 'trees']","Kuro is living in a country called Uberland, consisting of $n$ towns, numbered from $1$ to $n$, and $n - 1$ bidirectional roads connecting these towns. It is possible to reach each town from any other. Each road connects two towns $a$ and $b$. Kuro loves walking and he is planning to take a walking marathon, in which he will choose a pair of towns $(u, v)$ ($u \neq v$) and walk from $u$ using the shortest path to $v$ (note that $(u, v)$ is considered to be different from $(v, u)$).

Oddly, there are 2 special towns in Uberland named Flowrisa (denoted with the index $x$) and Beetopia (denoted with the index $y$). Flowrisa is a town where there are many strong-scent flowers, and Beetopia is another town where many bees live. In particular, Kuro will avoid any pair of towns $(u, v)$ if on the path from $u$ to $v$, he reaches Beetopia after he reached Flowrisa, since the bees will be attracted with the flower smell on Kuro’s body and sting him.

Kuro wants to know how many pair of city $(u, v)$ he can take as his route. Since he’s not really bright, he asked you to help him with this problem.","The first line contains three integers $n$, $x$ and $y$ ($1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \leq x, y \leq n$, $x \ne y$) - the number of towns, index of the town Flowrisa and index of the town Beetopia, respectively.

$n - 1$ lines follow, each line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \leq a, b \leq n$, $a \ne b$), describes a road connecting two towns $a$ and $b$.

It is guaranteed that from each town, we can reach every other town in the city using the given roads. That is, the given map of towns and roads is a tree.","A single integer resembles the number of pair of towns $(u, v)$ that Kuro can use as his walking route.","['3 1 3\n1 2\n2 3\n', '3 1 3\n1 2\n1 3\n']","['5', '4']","On the first example, Kuro can choose these pairs:

Kuro can't choose pair $(1, 3)$ since his walking route would be $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3$, in which Kuro visits town $1$ (Flowrisa) and then visits town $3$ (Beetopia), which is not allowed (note that pair $(3, 1)$ is still allowed because although Kuro visited Flowrisa and Beetopia, he did not visit them in that order).

On the second example, Kuro can choose the following pairs: 
 -  $(1, 2)$: his route would be $1 \rightarrow 2$, -  $(2, 1)$: his route would be $2 \rightarrow 1$, -  $(3, 2)$: his route would be $3 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2$, -  $(3, 1)$: his route would be $3 \rightarrow 1$.",TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED,"n,x,y=[int(x)for x in input().split()]

We are given the distributions for max(a,b) and min(a,b) for two independent dice with outcomes 1..n.
Let pmax[i] be the probability that max(a,b)==i, and pmin[i] be that min(a,b)==i.
Define
  M[i] = P(max(a,b) ≤ i) = sum_{j=1}^i pmax[j]   for i=1..n, with M[0]=0 and M[n]=1,
  m[i] = P(min(a,b) ≥ i) = sum_{j=i}^n pmin[j]   for i=1..n, with m[1]=1 and m[n+1]=0.
We wish to find two probability distributions for dice A and B (with CDFs F and G, respectively)
such that the joint order‐statistics have the given distributions.
It is easy to see that if we construct F and G so that

    F[i] * G[i] = M[i]   for i = 1..n   (1)
and
    (1 – F[i-1]) * (1 – G[i-1]) = m[i]   for i = 1..n   (2)

then the order statistics will match.
We have freedom to choose F. In our solution we determine F by “solving”
the second condition (with a little algebra):

For 1 ≤ i < n, note that G[i] = M[i] / F[i] (from (1)); hence
    (1 – F[i]) * (1 – M[i]/F[i]) = (1 – F[i]) * ((F[i] – M[i])/F[i])
                              = (1 – F[i])*(F[i] – M[i]) / F[i]
We want this to equal m[i+1] (since (2) applied at index i+1 yields
   (1 – F[i])*(1 – G[i]) = m[i+1]).
That is, we impose for i = 1 … n–1:
    (1 – F[i])*(F[i] – M[i]) = m[i+1] * F[i].
This is equivalent to the quadratic in t = F[i]:
    t^2 - t*(1 + M[i] - m[i+1]) + M[i] = 0.
We choose one of the two roots (the smaller one) so that the CDF has more “room” to be increasing.
Finally, set F[0]=0 and F[n]=1. Then define
    f_A[i] = F[i] - F[i-1]
and, from (1),
    G[i] = M[i] / F[i]  for i = 1..n-1 and G[n] = 1,
    f_B[i] = G[i] - G[i-1]  with G[0] defined as 0.
This pair (f_A, f_B) is a valid solution.
The following Python script implements this method.

Embosser is a special devise that allows to ""print"" the text of a plastic tape. Text is printed sequentially, character by character. The device consists of a wheel with a lowercase English letters written in a circle, static pointer to the current letter and a button that print the chosen letter. At one move it's allowed to rotate the alphabetic wheel one step clockwise or counterclockwise. Initially, static pointer points to letter 'a'. Other letters are located as shown on the picture:

After Grigoriy add new item to the base he has to print its name on the plastic tape and attach it to the corresponding exhibit. It's not required to return the wheel to its initial position with pointer on the letter 'a'.

Spinners in Sweetland have the form of V-shaped pieces of caramel. Each spinner can, well, spin around an invisible magic axis. At a specific point in time, a spinner can take 4 positions shown below (each one rotated 90 degrees relative to the previous, with the fourth one followed by the first one):

After the spinner was spun, it starts its rotation, which is described by a following algorithm: the spinner maintains its position for a second then majestically switches to the next position in clockwise or counter-clockwise order, depending on the direction the spinner was spun in.

Slastyona managed to have spinner rotating for exactly *n* seconds. Being fascinated by elegance of the process, she completely forgot the direction the spinner was spun in! Lucky for her, she managed to recall the starting position, and wants to deduct the direction given the information she knows. Help her do this.","There are two characters in the first string – the starting and the ending position of a spinner. The position is encoded with one of the following characters: v (ASCII code 118, lowercase v), &lt; (ASCII code 60), ^ (ASCII code 94) or &gt; (ASCII code 62) (see the picture above for reference). Characters are separated by a single space.

In the second strings, a single number *n* is given (0<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=109) – the duration of the rotation.

He will then press the snooze button every *x* minutes until *hh*:<=*mm* is reached, and only then he will wake up. He wants to know what is the smallest number of times he needs to press the snooze button.

A time is considered lucky if it contains a digit '7'. For example, 13:<=07 and 17:<=27 are lucky, while 00:<=48 and 21:<=34 are not lucky.

Note that it is not necessary that the time set for the alarm and the wake-up time are on the same day. It is guaranteed that there is a lucky time Jamie can set so that he can wake at *hh*:<=*mm*.

Formally, find the smallest possible non-negative integer *y* such that the time representation of the time *x*·*y* minutes before *hh*:<=*mm* contains the digit '7'.

Jamie uses 24-hours clock, so after 23:<=59 comes 00:<=00.","The first line contains a single integer *x* (1<=≤<=*x*<=≤<=60).

704,B,Ant Man,PROGRAMMING,"['dp', 'graphs', 'greedy']","Scott Lang is at war with Darren Cross. There are *n* chairs in a hall where they are, numbered with 1,<=2,<=...,<=*n* from left to right. The *i*-th chair is located at coordinate *x**i*. Scott is on chair number *s* and Cross is on chair number *e*. Scott can jump to all other chairs (not only neighboring chairs). He wants to start at his position (chair number *s*), visit each chair exactly once and end up on chair number *e* with Cross. 

As we all know, Scott can shrink or grow big (grow big only to his normal size), so at any moment of time he can be either small or large (normal). The thing is, he can only shrink or grow big while being on a chair (not in the air while jumping to another chair). Jumping takes time, but shrinking and growing big takes no time. Jumping from chair number *i* to chair number *j* takes |*x**i*<=-<=*x**j*| seconds. Also, jumping off a chair and landing on a chair takes extra amount of time. 

If Scott wants to jump to a chair on his left, he can only be small, and if he wants to jump to a chair on his right he should be large.

Jumping off the *i*-th chair takes:
 -  *c**i* extra seconds if he's small. -  *d**i* extra seconds otherwise (he's large). 
Also, landing on *i*-th chair takes:
 -  *b**i* extra seconds if he's small. -  *a**i* extra seconds otherwise (he's large). 
In simpler words, jumping from *i*-th chair to *j*-th chair takes exactly:
 -  |*x**i*<=-<=*x**j*|<=+<=*c**i*<=+<=*b**j* seconds if *j*<=&lt;<=*i*. -  |*x**i*<=-<=*x**j*|<=+<=*d**i*<=+<=*a**j* seconds otherwise (*j*<=&gt;<=*i*). 
Given values of *x*, *a*, *b*, *c*, *d* find the minimum time Scott can get to Cross, assuming he wants to visit each chair exactly once.","The first line of the input contains three integers *n*,<=*s* and *e* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=5000,<=1<=≤<=*s*,<=*e*<=≤<=*n*,<=*s*<=≠<=*e*) — the total number of chairs, starting and ending positions of Scott.

The second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*, where each *a**i* either equals to 0 (then vertex *i* has no cat), or equals to 1 (then vertex *i* has a cat).

Recently at the BSU was an important test work on which Vasya recived the mark *a*. It is very hard for the teacher to remember the exact mark of every student, but he knows the mark *b*, such that every student recieved mark strictly smaller than *b*.

Vasya isn't satisfied with his mark so he decided to improve it. He can swap characters in the string corresponding to his mark as many times as he like. Now he want to know only the number of different ways to improve his mark so that his teacher didn't notice something suspicious.

More formally: you are given two strings *a*, *b* of the same length and you need to figure out the number of different strings *c* such that:

1) *c* can be obtained from *a* by swapping some characters, in other words *c* is a permutation of *a*.

2) String *a* is lexicographically smaller than *c*.

3) String *c* is lexicographically smaller than *b*.

253,C,Text Editor,PROGRAMMING,"['data structures', 'dfs and similar', 'graphs', 'greedy', 'shortest paths']","Vasya is pressing the keys on the keyboard reluctantly, squeezing out his ideas on the classical epos depicted in Homer's Odysseus... How can he explain to his literature teacher that he isn't going to become a writer? In fact, he is going to become a programmer. So, he would take great pleasure in writing a program, but none — in writing a composition.

As Vasya was fishing for a sentence in the dark pond of his imagination, he suddenly wondered: what is the least number of times he should push a key to shift the cursor from one position to another one?

Let's describe his question more formally: to type a text, Vasya is using the text editor. He has already written *n* lines, the *i*-th line contains *a**i* characters (including spaces). If some line contains *k* characters, then this line overall contains (*k*<=+<=1) positions where the cursor can stand: before some character or after all characters (at the end of the line). Thus, the cursor's position is determined by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*), where *r* is the number of the line and *c* is the cursor's position in the line (the positions are indexed starting from one from the beginning of the line).

Vasya doesn't use the mouse to move the cursor. He uses keys ""Up"", ""Down"", ""Right"" and ""Left"". When he pushes each of these keys, the cursor shifts in the needed direction. Let's assume that before the corresponding key is pressed, the cursor was located in the position (*r*,<=*c*), then Vasya pushed key:
-  ""Up"": if the cursor was located in the first line (*r*<==<=1), then it does not move. Otherwise, it moves to the previous line (with number *r*<=-<=1), to the same position. At that, if the previous line was short, that is, the cursor couldn't occupy position *c* there, the cursor moves to the last position of the line with number *r*<=-<=1;-  ""Down"": if the cursor was located in the last line (*r*<==<=*n*), then it does not move. Otherwise, it moves to the next line (with number *r*<=+<=1), to the same position. At that, if the next line was short, that is, the cursor couldn't occupy position *c* there, the cursor moves to the last position of the line with number *r*<=+<=1;-  ""Right"": if the cursor can move to the right in this line (*c*<=&lt;<=*a**r*<=+<=1), then it moves to the right (to position *c*<=+<=1). Otherwise, it is located at the end of the line and doesn't move anywhere when Vasya presses the ""Right"" key;-  ""Left"": if the cursor can move to the left in this line (*c*<=&gt;<=1), then it moves to the left (to position *c*<=-<=1). Otherwise, it is located at the beginning of the line and doesn't move anywhere when Vasya presses the ""Left"" key.
You've got the number of lines in the text file and the number of characters, written in each line of this file. Find the least number of times Vasya should push the keys, described above, to shift the cursor from position (*r*1,<=*c*1) to position (*r*2,<=*c*2).","The first line of the input contains an integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100) — the number of lines in the file. The second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=105), separated by single spaces. The third line contains four integers *r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2 (1<=≤<=*r*1,<=*r*2<=≤<=*n*,<=1<=≤<=*c*1<=≤<=*a**r*1<=+<=1,<=1<=≤<=*c*2<=≤<=*a**r*2<=+<=1).","Print a single integer — the minimum number of times Vasya should push a key to move the cursor from position (*r*1,<=*c*1) to position (*r*2,<=*c*2).","['4\n2 1 6 4\n3 4 4 2\n', '4\n10 5 6 4\n1 11 4 2\n', '3\n10 1 10\n1 10 1 1\n']","['3\n', '6\n', '3\n']","In the first sample the editor contains four lines. Let's represent the cursor's possible positions in the line as numbers. Letter *s* represents the cursor's initial position, letter *t* represents the last one. Then all possible positions of the cursor in the text editor are described by the following table.

Once upon a time in a far away kingdom lived the King. The King had a beautiful daughter, Victoria. They lived happily, but not happily ever after: one day a vicious dragon attacked the kingdom and stole Victoria. The King was full of grief, yet he gathered his noble knights and promised half of his kingdom and Victoria's hand in marriage to the one who will save the girl from the infernal beast.

Having travelled for some time, the knights found the dragon's lair and all of them rushed there to save Victoria. Each knight spat on the dragon once and, as the dragon had quite a fragile and frail heart, his heart broke and poor beast died. As for the noble knights, they got Victoria right to the King and started brawling as each one wanted the girl's hand in marriage.

The problem was that all the noble knights were equally noble and equally handsome, and Victoria didn't want to marry any of them anyway. Then the King (and he was a very wise man and didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings) decided to find out who will get his daughter randomly, i.e. tossing a coin. However, there turned out to be *n* noble knights and the coin only has two sides. The good thing is that when a coin is tossed, the coin falls on each side with equal probability. The King got interested how to pick one noble knight using this coin so that all knights had equal probability of being chosen (the probability in that case should always be equal to 1<=/<=*n*). First the King wants to know the expected number of times he will need to toss a coin to determine the winner. Besides, while tossing the coin, the King should follow the optimal tossing strategy (i.e. the strategy that minimizes the expected number of tosses).

78,C,Beaver Game,PROGRAMMING,"['dp', 'games', 'number theory']","Two beavers, Timur and Marsel, play the following game.

There are *n* logs, each of exactly *m* meters in length. The beavers move in turns.

Each resulting part is also a log which can be gnawed in future by any beaver. The beaver that can't make a move loses. Thus, the other beaver wins.

46,B,T-shirts from Sponsor,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"One day a well-known sponsor of a well-known contest decided to give every participant of the contest a T-shirt as a present. A natural problem occurred: on the one hand, it is not clear how many T-shirts of what sizes should be ordered, and on the other hand, one doesn't want to order too many T-shirts (and we do not exactly paper the walls with the oversupply). After considerable brain racking and some pre-estimating, the sponsor representatives ordered a certain number of T-shirts of sizes S, M, L, XL and XXL. The T-shirts turned out to bring good luck, that's why on the contest day there built up a line of *K* participants willing to get one. Every contestant is characterized by his/her desired T-shirt size (so it happens that for all the participants it is also one of the sizes S, M, L, XL and XXL). The participants come up to get a T-shirt one by one and try to choose the most suitable one, choosing it like this. If there is still a T-shirt of the optimal size left, that he/she takes it without further ado. Otherwise the contestant would prefer to choose a T-shirt with the size as close to the optimal one as possible (the distance between neighboring sizes is considered equal to one). If the variant of choice is not unique, the contestant will take a T-shirt of a bigger size (in case he/she grows more). For example, for a person whose optimal size is L the preference list looks like this: L, XL, M, XXL, S. Using the data on how many T-shirts of every size had been ordered by the organizers, on the size of contestants in the line determine who got a T-shirt of what size.","The first line contains five non-negative integers *N**S*,<=*N**M*,<=*N**L*,<=*N**XL*,<=*N**XXL* not exceeding 1000 which represent the number of T-shirts of the corresponding sizes.

# This script computes the maximum number of coins 
# an unlucky buyer could have used when he doesn’t possess 
# a collection that allows him to pay exactly n marks.
#
# The state only has coins of denominations that are powers of 3:
# 1, 3, 9, 27, and so on. If the buyer had coins that allow him to 
# pay exactly n, he would not be unlucky. So we consider only those
# multisets of coins for which no subset sums to exactly n.
#
# A natural strategy (from the seller’s point of view) to force the buyer
# to overpay with as many coins as possible is to have coins all of the same 
# denomination d. Then every subset sum is a multiple of d. If n is not a 
# multiple of d, the buyer cannot pay exactly n. However, to be able to pay at
# least n, he must use m = ceil(n/d) coins (since (m-1) coins would sum to less 
# than n). We want to maximize m.
#
# Notice that m = ceil(n/d) increases when d is smaller. So in order to push m
# as high as possible we want d to be as small as possible.
#
# Unfortunately we cannot take d = 1 because for every n,
#  n mod 1 == 0, and then the buyer would be able to pay exactly n using ones.
#
# Therefore, we iterate over powers of 3 starting from 3, 
# and choose the smallest such power d that does not divide n.
#
# There is one more possibility: when no power of 3 less than or equal to n 
# is suitable (i.e. every coin d <= n divides n), we choose the next power 
# of 3 (which will be > n). In that case the buyer is forced to use one coin only.
#
# Examples:
#  n = 1: The first power we try is 3, and since 1 % 3 != 0, we choose d = 3.
#         Then m = ceil(1/3) = 1.
#  n = 4: 4 % 3 != 0 so we choose d = 3. Then m = ceil(4/3) = 2.
#  n = 8: 8 % 3 != 0 so we choose d = 3. Then m = ceil(8/3) = 3.
#  n = 12: 12 % 3 == 0, so we try the next coin d = 9 (since 12 % 9 != 0).
#         Then m = ceil(12/9) = 2.
#
# The answer is then m = ceil(n/d).

186,B,Growing Mushrooms,PROGRAMMING,"['greedy', 'sortings']","Each year in the castle of Dwarven King there is a competition in growing mushrooms among the dwarves. The competition is one of the most prestigious ones, and the winner gets a wooden salad bowl. This year's event brought together the best mushroom growers from around the world, so we had to slightly change the rules so that the event gets more interesting to watch.

Each mushroom grower has a mushroom that he will grow on the competition. Under the new rules, the competition consists of two parts. The first part lasts *t*1 seconds and the second part lasts *t*2 seconds. The first and the second part are separated by a little break.

After the starting whistle the first part of the contest starts, and all mushroom growers start growing mushrooms at once, each at his individual speed of *v**i* meters per second. After *t*1 seconds, the mushroom growers stop growing mushrooms and go to have a break. During the break, for unexplained reasons, the growth of all mushrooms is reduced by *k* percent. After the break the second part of the contest starts and all mushrooms growers at the same time continue to grow mushrooms, each at his individual speed of *u**i* meters per second. After a *t*2 seconds after the end of the break, the competition ends. Note that the speeds before and after the break may vary.

Before the match dwarf Pasha learned from all participants, what two speeds they have chosen. However, the participants did not want to disclose to him all their strategy and therefore, did not say in what order they will be using these speeds. That is, if a participant chose speeds *a**i* and *b**i*, then there are two strategies: he either uses speed *a**i* before the break and speed *b**i* after it, or vice versa.

Dwarf Pasha really wants to win the totalizer. He knows that each participant chooses the strategy that maximizes the height of the mushroom. Help Dwarf Pasha make the final table of competition results.

The participants are sorted in the result table by the mushroom height (the participants with higher mushrooms follow earlier in the table). In case of equal mushroom heights, the participants are sorted by their numbers (the participants with a smaller number follow earlier).","The first input line contains four integer numbers *n*, *t*1, *t*2, *k* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*t*1,<=*t*2<=≤<=1000; 1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=100) — the number of participants, the time before the break, the time after the break and the percentage, by which the mushroom growth drops during the break, correspondingly.

Each of the following *n* lines contains two integers.

The painter is not allowed to draw characters in the adjacent squares when the ladder is in front of the *i*-th square because the uncomfortable position of the ladder may make the characters untidy. Besides, the programmers can move the ladder. In one hour, they can move the ladder either a meter to the right or a meter to the left.

Drawing characters and moving the ladder is very tiring, so the programmers want to finish the job in as little time as possible. Develop for them an optimal poster painting plan!","The first line contains two integers, *n* and *k* (1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100) — the number of characters in the slogan and the initial position of the ladder, correspondingly. The next line contains the slogan as *n* characters written without spaces. Each character of the slogan is either a large English letter, or digit, or one of the characters: '.', '!', ',', '?'.","In *t* lines, print the actions the programmers need to make. In the *i*-th line print:
 -  ""LEFT"" (without the quotes), if the *i*-th action was ""move the ladder to the left""; -  ""RIGHT"" (without the quotes), if the *i*-th action was ""move the ladder to the right""; -  ""PRINT *x*"" (without the quotes), if the *i*-th action was to ""go up the ladder, paint character *x*, go down the ladder"". 
The painting time (variable *t*) must be minimum possible. If there are multiple optimal painting plans, you can print any of them.","['2 2\nR1\n', '2 1\nR1\n', '6 4\nGO?GO!\n']","['PRINT 1\nLEFT\nPRINT R\n', 'PRINT R\nRIGHT\nPRINT 1\n', 'RIGHT\nRIGHT\nPRINT !\nLEFT\nPRINT O\nLEFT\nPRINT G\nLEFT\nPRINT ?\nLEFT\nPRINT O\nLEFT\nPRINT G\n']","Note that the ladder cannot be shifted by less than one meter.

Mr. Scrooge's signature can be represented as a polyline *A*1*A*2... *A**n*.

At that the resulting line can intersect with itself and partially repeat itself but Scrooge pays no attention to it and never changes his signing style. As Scrooge makes the signature, he never takes the pen off the paper and his writing speed is constant — 50 millimeters per second.

 In any right-angled triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle). 

The theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the sides *a*, *b* and *c*, often called the Pythagorean equation:

At this point the Smart Beaver got rushing. Everything should be perfect by Friday, so he needed to prepare the belt to the upcoming walk. He needed to cut down several trees.

Let's consider the woodland belt as a sequence of trees. Each tree *i* is described by the esthetic appeal *a**i* — some trees are very esthetically pleasing, others are 'so-so', and some trees are positively ugly!

The Smart Beaver calculated that he needed the following effects to win the Beaverette's heart: 
 -  The first objective is to please the Beaverette: the sum of esthetic appeal of the remaining trees must be maximum possible; -  the second objective is to surprise the Beaverette: the esthetic appeal of the first and the last trees in the resulting belt must be the same; -  and of course, the walk should be successful: there must be at least two trees in the woodland belt left.

 -  to get 30 points, you need to solve the problem with constraints: *n*<=≤<=100 (subproblem A1); -  to get 100 points, you need to solve the problem with constraints: *n*<=≤<=3·105 (subproblems A1+A2).","In the first line print two integers — the total esthetic appeal of the woodland belt after the Smart Beaver's intervention and the number of the cut down trees *k*.

Then at one turn Barney swaps the cup in the middle with any of other two cups randomly (he choses each with equal probability), so the chosen cup becomes the middle one. Game lasts *n* turns and Barney independently choses a cup to swap with the middle one within each turn, and the key always remains in the cup it was at the start.

After *n*-th turn Barney asks a girl to guess which cup contains the key. The girl points to the middle one but Barney was distracted while making turns and doesn't know if the key is under the middle cup. That's why he asked you to tell him the probability that girl guessed right.

Number *n* of game turns can be extremely large, that's why Barney did not give it to you. Instead he gave you an array *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**k* such that

The girl lives in house *m* of a village. There are *n* houses in that village, lining in a straight line from left to right: house 1, house 2, ..., house *n*. The village is also well-structured: house *i* and house *i*<=+<=1 (1<=≤<=*i*<=&lt;<=*n*) are exactly 10 meters away. In this village, some houses are occupied, and some are not. Indeed, unoccupied houses can be purchased.

You will be given *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* that denote the availability and the prices of the houses. If house *i* is occupied, and therefore cannot be bought, then *a**i* equals 0. Otherwise, house *i* can be bought, and *a**i* represents the money required to buy it, in dollars.

As Zane has only *k* dollars to spare, it becomes a challenge for him to choose the house to purchase, so that he could live as near as possible to his crush. Help Zane determine the minimum distance from his crush's house to some house he can afford, to help him succeed in his love.","The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, and *k* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100, 1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=*n*, 1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=100) — the number of houses in the village, the house where the girl lives, and the amount of money Zane has (in dollars), respectively.

Both robots' programs make them choose their numbers in such a way that their choice in (*i*<=+<=1)-th game depends only on the numbers chosen by them in *i*-th game. 

Ilya knows that the robots will play *k* games, Alice will choose number *a* in the first game, and Bob will choose *b* in the first game. He also knows both robots' programs and can tell what each robot will choose depending on their choices in previous game. Ilya doesn't want to wait until robots play all *k* games, so he asks you to predict the number of points they will have after the final game.","The first line contains three numbers *k*, *a*, *b* (1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=1018, 1<=≤<=*a*,<=*b*<=≤<=3). 

Then 3 lines follow, *i*-th of them containing 3 numbers *A**i*,<=1, *A**i*,<=2, *A**i*,<=3, where *A**i*,<=*j* represents Alice's choice in the game if Alice chose *i* in previous game and Bob chose *j* (1<=≤<=*A**i*,<=*j*<=≤<=3). 

Then 3 lines follow, *i*-th of them containing 3 numbers *B**i*,<=1, *B**i*,<=2, *B**i*,<=3, where *B**i*,<=*j* represents Bob's choice in the game if Alice chose *i* in previous game and Bob chose *j* (1<=≤<=*B**i*,<=*j*<=≤<=3).","Print two numbers. First of them has to be equal to the number of points Alice will have, and second of them must be Bob's score after *k* games.","['10 2 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n2 2 2\n2 2 2\n2 2 2\n', '8 1 1\n2 2 1\n3 3 1\n3 1 3\n1 1 1\n2 1 1\n1 2 3\n', '5 1 1\n1 2 2\n2 2 2\n2 2 2\n1 2 2\n2 2 2\n2 2 2\n']","['1 9\n', '5 2\n', '0 0\n']","In the second example game goes like this:

The players move like that: one player puts one or several of his cards on the table and the other one should beat each of them with his cards.

A card beats another one if both cards have similar suits and the first card has a higher rank then the second one. Besides, a trump card can beat any non-trump card whatever the cards’ ranks are. In all other cases you can not beat the second card with the first one.

 1.  Go 1 unit towards the positive direction, denoted as '+' 1.  Go 1 unit towards the negative direction, denoted as '-' 
But the Wi-Fi condition is so poor that Dreamoon's smartphone reports some of the commands can't be recognized and Dreamoon knows that some of them might even be wrong though successfully recognized. Dreamoon decides to follow every recognized command and toss a fair coin to decide those unrecognized ones (that means, he moves to the 1 unit to the negative or positive direction with the same probability 0.5). 

You are given an original list of commands sent by Drazil and list received by Dreamoon. What is the probability that Dreamoon ends in the position originally supposed to be final by Drazil's commands?","The first line contains a string *s*1 — the commands Drazil sends to Dreamoon, this string consists of only the characters in the set {'+', '-'}. 

The second line contains a string *s*2 — the commands Dreamoon's smartphone recognizes, this string consists of only the characters in the set {'+', '-', '?'}. '?' denotes an unrecognized command.

""""""
We are given an n*n matrix initially filled with zeroes.
We must set exactly k ones such that the matrix is symmetric
with respect to the main diagonal and is lexicographically maximal.
A symmetric matrix has matrix[i][j] == matrix[j][i] for all i, j.
For off-diagonal entries, setting a one implies setting both (i,j)
and (j,i) to 1 (cost = 2 ones), while a diagonal
entry (i,i) costs just 1.
To achieve lexicographical maximality,
we want the earliest (in row‐major order) cells to be 1 if possible,
provided we can complete the matrix while keeping the total count exactly k.

We build a list of “free decisions” corresponding to the independent cells:
•   For each diagonal (i,i): cost = 1.
•   For each off–diagonal cell (i,j) with i < j: cost = 2.
They are sorted by their row–major order position (the first appearance is used as order).

We then greedily decide in that order:
For each free decision, if setting it to 1 (i.e. “using its cost”) still allows 
the remaining free decisions to sum up to exactly the remaining target,
we choose 1 here. Otherwise, we leave it at 0.
To quickly check the feasibility with remaining free decisions,
we precompute suffix counts: how many diagonal (cost 1) and off–diagonal (cost 2) decisions remain.
This gives an upper bound on the maximum ones that can be added.

Finally, we construct the full symmetric matrix accordingly.
If it turns out that we cannot exactly allocate k ones, we output -1.

You are given geometric progression *b* defined by two integers *b*1 and *q*. Remind that a geometric progression is a sequence of integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=*b*3,<=..., where for each *i*<=&gt;<=1 the respective term satisfies the condition *b**i*<==<=*b**i*<=-<=1·*q*, where *q* is called the common ratio of the progression. Progressions in Uzhlyandia are unusual: both *b*1 and *q* can equal 0. Also, Dvastan gave Masha *m* ""bad"" integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**m*, and an integer *l*.

Masha writes all progression terms one by one onto the board (including repetitive) while condition |*b**i*|<=≤<=*l* is satisfied (|*x*| means absolute value of *x*). There is an exception: if a term equals one of the ""bad"" integers, Masha skips it (doesn't write onto the board) and moves forward to the next term.

But the lesson is going to end soon, so Masha has to calculate how many integers will be written on the board. In order not to get into depression, Masha asked you for help: help her calculate how many numbers she will write, or print ""inf"" in case she needs to write infinitely many integers.","The first line of input contains four integers *b*1, *q*, *l*, *m* (-109<=≤<=*b*1,<=*q*<=≤<=109, 1<=≤<=*l*<=≤<=109, 1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=105) — the initial term and the common ratio of progression, absolute value of maximal number that can be written on the board and the number of ""bad"" integers, respectively.

We know that the main information in a day report is value *a**i*, the company's profit on the *i*-th day. If *a**i* is negative, then the company suffered losses on the *i*-th day.

Polycarpus should sort the daily reports into folders. Each folder should include data on the company's performance for several consecutive days.

914,D,Bash and a Tough Math Puzzle,PROGRAMMING,"['data structures', 'number theory']","Bash likes playing with arrays. He has an array *a*1,<=*a*2,<=... *a**n* of *n* integers. He likes to guess the greatest common divisor (gcd) of different segments of the array. Of course, sometimes the guess is not correct. However, Bash will be satisfied if his guess is almost correct.

Suppose he guesses that the gcd of the elements in the range [*l*,<=*r*] of *a* is *x*. He considers the guess to be almost correct if he can change at most one element in the segment such that the gcd of the segment is *x* after making the change. Note that when he guesses, he doesn't actually change the array — he just wonders if the gcd of the segment can be made *x*. Apart from this, he also sometimes makes changes to the array itself.

Since he can't figure it out himself, Bash wants you to tell him which of his guesses are almost correct. Formally, you have to process *q* queries of one of the following forms:
 -  1<=*l*<=*r*<=*x* — Bash guesses that the gcd of the range [*l*,<=*r*] is *x*. Report if this guess is almost correct. -  2<=*i*<=*y* — Bash sets *a**i* to *y*. 
Note: The array is 1-indexed.","The first line contains an integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=5·105)  — the size of the array.

The second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=109)  — the elements of the array.

The third line contains an integer *q* (1<=≤<=*q*<=≤<=4·105)  — the number of queries.

The next *q* lines describe the queries and may have one of the following forms:
 -  1<=*l*<=*r*<=*x* (1<=≤<=*l*<=≤<=*r*<=≤<=*n*,<=1<=≤<=*x*<=≤<=109). -  2<=*i*<=*y* (1<=≤<=*i*<=≤<=*n*,<=1<=≤<=*y*<=≤<=109).

# This script solves the problem of partitioning a sequence of numbers into groups of three.
# Each group (a, b, c) must satisfy: a <= b <= c and a divides b, b divides c.
# The only possible valid groups given numbers up to 7 are:
#   - (1, 2, 4)   because 1 divides 2 and 2 divides 4.
#   - (1, 2, 6)   because 1 divides 2 and 2 divides 6.
#   - (1, 3, 6)   because 1 divides 3 and 3 divides 6.
#
# Any occurrence of numbers 5 or 7 will immediately result in an invalid partition.
# The approach is to count the occurrences of each number (only numbers 1,2,3,4,6 are involved in valid groups)
# and then determine how many of each group we can form using the equations:
#
#   Let:
#     A = count of (1,2,4)
#     B = count of (1,2,6)
#     C = count of (1,3,6)
#
#   Then, the counts in the list must satisfy:
#     Total groups: A + B + C = count[1] (each group uses one ""1"")
#     For number 2:  A + B = count[2]
#     For number 3:  C = count[3]
#     For number 4:  A = count[4]
#     For number 6:  B + C = count[6]
#
# Also, count[1] must equal count[2] + count[3].
#
# If these conditions hold, then the partition is possible. Otherwise, print -1.
