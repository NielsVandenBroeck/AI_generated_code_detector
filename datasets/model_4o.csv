604,A,Uncowed Forces,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Kevin Sun has just finished competing in Codeforces Round #334! The round was 120 minutes long and featured five problems with maximum point values of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500, respectively. Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.

Codeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is *x*, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute *m* but made *w* wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is . His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.

All arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.","The first line of the input contains five space-separated integers *m*1, *m*2, *m*3, *m*4, *m*5, where *m**i* (0<=≤<=*m**i*<=≤<=119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem *i*. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted.

The second line contains five space-separated integers *w*1, *w*2, *w*3, *w*4, *w*5, where *w**i* (0<=≤<=*w**i*<=≤<=10) is Kevin's number of wrong submissions on problem *i*.

The last line contains two space-separated integers *h**s* and *h**u* (0<=≤<=*h**s*,<=*h**u*<=≤<=20), denoting the Kevin's numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively.","Print a single integer, the value of Kevin's final score.","['20 40 60 80 100\n0 1 2 3 4\n1 0\n', '119 119 119 119 119\n0 0 0 0 0\n10 0\n']","['4900\n', '4930\n']","In the second sample, Kevin takes 119 minutes on all of the problems.

Kostya has a friend Zahar who works at a career. Zahar knows about Kostya's idea and wants to present him a rectangular parallelepiped of marble from which he can carve the sphere. 

Zahar has *n* stones which are rectangular parallelepipeds. The edges sizes of the *i*-th of them are *a**i*, *b**i* and *c**i*. He can take no more than two stones and present them to Kostya. 

If Zahar takes two stones, he should glue them together on one of the faces in order to get a new piece of rectangular parallelepiped of marble. Thus, it is possible to glue a pair of stones together if and only if two faces on which they are glued together match as rectangles. In such gluing it is allowed to rotate and flip the stones in any way. 

Help Zahar choose such a present so that Kostya can carve a sphere of the maximum possible volume and present it to Zahar.","The first line contains the integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105).

Embosser is a special devise that allows to ""print"" the text of a plastic tape. Text is printed sequentially, character by character. The device consists of a wheel with a lowercase English letters written in a circle, static pointer to the current letter and a button that print the chosen letter. At one move it's allowed to rotate the alphabetic wheel one step clockwise or counterclockwise. Initially, static pointer points to letter 'a'. Other letters are located as shown on the picture:

834,A,The Useless Toy,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Walking through the streets of Marshmallow City, Slastyona have spotted some merchants selling a kind of useless toy which is very popular nowadays – caramel spinner! Wanting to join the craze, she has immediately bought the strange contraption.

Spinners in Sweetland have the form of V-shaped pieces of caramel. Each spinner can, well, spin around an invisible magic axis. At a specific point in time, a spinner can take 4 positions shown below (each one rotated 90 degrees relative to the previous, with the fourth one followed by the first one):

After the spinner was spun, it starts its rotation, which is described by a following algorithm: the spinner maintains its position for a second then majestically switches to the next position in clockwise or counter-clockwise order, depending on the direction the spinner was spun in.

Slastyona managed to have spinner rotating for exactly *n* seconds. Being fascinated by elegance of the process, she completely forgot the direction the spinner was spun in! Lucky for her, she managed to recall the starting position, and wants to deduct the direction given the information she knows. Help her do this.","There are two characters in the first string – the starting and the ending position of a spinner. The position is encoded with one of the following characters: v (ASCII code 118, lowercase v), &lt; (ASCII code 60), ^ (ASCII code 94) or &gt; (ASCII code 62) (see the picture above for reference). Characters are separated by a single space.

In the second strings, a single number *n* is given (0<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=109) – the duration of the rotation.

It is guaranteed that the ending position of a spinner is a result of a *n* second spin in any of the directions, assuming the given starting position.","Output cw, if the direction is clockwise, ccw – if counter-clockwise, and undefined otherwise.","['^ &gt;\n1\n', '&lt; ^\n3\n', '^ v\n6\n']","['cw\n', 'ccw\n', 'undefined\n']",none,RUNTIME_ERROR,"c=['^','<','v','>']

With his old computer Ivan had to choose the worst possible graphic settings (because otherwise the framerate would be really low), but now he wants to check, maybe his new computer can perform well even with the best possible graphics?

There are *m* graphics parameters in the game. *i*-th parameter can be set to any positive integer from 1 to *a**i*, and initially is set to *b**i* (*b**i*<=≤<=*a**i*). So there are  different combinations of parameters. Ivan can increase or decrease any of these parameters by 1; after that the game will be restarted with new parameters (and Ivan will have the opportunity to check chosen combination of parameters).

Ivan wants to try all *p* possible combinations. Also he wants to return to the initial settings after trying all combinations, because he thinks that initial settings can be somehow best suited for his hardware. But Ivan doesn't really want to make a lot of restarts.

So he wants you to tell the following:
 -  If there exists a way to make exactly *p* changes (each change either decreases or increases some parameter by 1) to try all possible combinations and return to initial combination, then Ivan wants to know this way. -  Otherwise, if there exists a way to make exactly *p*<=-<=1 changes to try all possible combinations (including the initial one), then Ivan wants to know this way.

46,A,Ball Game,PROGRAMMING,"['brute force', 'implementation']","A kindergarten teacher Natalia Pavlovna has invented a new ball game. This game not only develops the children's physique, but also teaches them how to count. 

The game goes as follows. Kids stand in circle. Let's agree to think of the children as numbered with numbers from 1 to *n* clockwise and the child number 1 is holding the ball. First the first child throws the ball to the next one clockwise, i.e. to the child number 2. Then the child number 2 throws the ball to the next but one child, i.e. to the child number 4, then the fourth child throws the ball to the child that stands two children away from him, i.e. to the child number 7, then the ball is thrown to the child who stands 3 children away from the child number 7, then the ball is thrown to the child who stands 4 children away from the last one, and so on. It should be mentioned that when a ball is thrown it may pass the beginning of the circle. For example, if *n*<==<=5, then after the third throw the child number 2 has the ball again. Overall, *n*<=-<=1 throws are made, and the game ends.

The problem is that not all the children get the ball during the game. If a child doesn't get the ball, he gets very upset and cries until Natalia Pavlovna gives him a candy. That's why Natalia Pavlovna asks you to help her to identify the numbers of the children who will get the ball after each throw.",The first line contains integer *n* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100) which indicates the number of kids in the circle.,In the single line print *n*<=-<=1 numbers which are the numbers of children who will get the ball after each throw.

Since Jaggy became the ruler of the forest, he has been trying his best to improve the diplomatic relations between the forest region and the nearby ones. 

Some other rulers, however, have requested too much in return for peace between their two regions, so he realized he has to resort to intimidation. Once a delegate for diplomatic relations of a neighboring region visits Jaggy’s forest, if they see a whole bunch of black boars, they might suddenly change their mind about attacking Jaggy. Black boars are really scary, after all. 

Jaggy’s forest can be represented as a tree (connected graph without cycles) with *n* vertices. Each vertex represents a boar and is colored either black or pink. Jaggy has sent a squirrel to travel through the forest and paint all the boars black. The squirrel, however, is quite unusually trained and while it traverses the graph, it changes the color of every vertex it visits, regardless of its initial color: pink vertices become black and black vertices become pink. 

Since Jaggy is too busy to plan the squirrel’s route, he needs your help. He wants you to construct a walk through the tree starting from vertex 1 such that in the end all vertices are black.

 -  each student in the team scored at least *l* points and at most *r* points; -  in total, all members of the team scored exactly *s**all* points; -  the total score of the *k* members of the team who scored the most points is equal to exactly *s**k*; more formally, if *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* is the sequence of points earned by the team of students in the non-increasing order (*a*1<=≥<=*a*2<=≥<=...<=≥<=*a**n*), then *s**k*<==<=*a*1<=+<=*a*2<=+<=...<=+<=*a**k*.

Find the minimum number of days on which Vasya will have a rest (it means, he will not do sport and write the contest at the same time).

681,C,Heap Operations,PROGRAMMING,"['constructive algorithms', 'data structures', 'greedy']","Petya has recently learned data structure named ""Binary heap"".

The heap he is now operating with allows the following operations: 
 -  put the given number into the heap; -  get the value of the minimum element in the heap; -  extract the minimum element from the heap; 
Thus, at any moment of time the heap contains several integers (possibly none), some of them might be equal.

In order to better learn this data structure Petya took an empty heap and applied some operations above to it. Also, he carefully wrote down all the operations and their results to his event log, following the format: 
 -  insert *x* — put the element with value *x* in the heap; -  getMin *x* — the value of the minimum element contained in the heap was equal to *x*; -  removeMin — the minimum element was extracted from the heap (only one instance, if there were many). 
All the operations were correct, i.e. there was at least one element in the heap each time getMin or removeMin operations were applied.

While Petya was away for a lunch, his little brother Vova came to the room, took away some of the pages from Petya's log and used them to make paper boats.

Now Vova is worried, if he made Petya's sequence of operations inconsistent. For example, if one apply operations one-by-one in the order they are written in the event log, results of getMin operations might differ from the results recorded by Petya, and some of getMin or removeMin operations may be incorrect, as the heap is empty at the moment they are applied.

Now Vova wants to add some new operation records to the event log in order to make the resulting sequence of operations correct. That is, the result of each getMin operation is equal to the result in the record, and the heap is non-empty when getMin ad removeMin are applied. Vova wants to complete this as fast as possible, as the Petya may get back at any moment. He asks you to add the least possible number of operation records to the current log. Note that arbitrary number of operations may be added at the beginning, between any two other operations, or at the end of the log.","The first line of the input contains the only integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100<=000) — the number of the records left in Petya's journal.

Each of the following *n* lines describe the records in the current log in the order they are applied. Format described in the statement is used. All numbers in the input are integers not exceeding 109 by their absolute value.","The first line of the output should contain a single integer *m* — the minimum possible number of records in the modified sequence of operations.

Next *m* lines should contain the corrected sequence of records following the format of the input (described in the statement), one per line and in the order they are applied. All the numbers in the output should be integers not exceeding 109 by their absolute value.

Note that the input sequence of operations must be the subsequence of the output sequence.

It's guaranteed that there exists the correct answer consisting of no more than 1<=000<=000 operations.","['2\ninsert 3\ngetMin 4\n', '4\ninsert 1\ninsert 1\nremoveMin\ngetMin 2\n']","['4\ninsert 3\nremoveMin\ninsert 4\ngetMin 4\n', '6\ninsert 1\ninsert 1\nremoveMin\nremoveMin\ninsert 2\ngetMin 2\n']","In the first sample, after number 3 is inserted into the heap, the minimum number is 3.

Each of the stages is defined by a lowercase Latin letter. This way, the rocket can be described by the string — concatenation of letters, which correspond to the stages.

There are $n$ stages available. The rocket must contain exactly $k$ of them. Stages in the rocket should be ordered by their weight. So, after the stage with some letter can go only stage with a letter, which is at least two positions after in the alphabet (skipping one letter in between, or even more). For example, after letter 'c' can't go letters 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd', but can go letters 'e', 'f', ..., 'z'.

For the rocket to fly as far as possible, its weight should be minimal. The weight of the rocket is equal to the sum of the weights of its stages. The weight of the stage is the number of its letter in the alphabet. For example, the stage 'a 'weighs one ton,' b 'weighs two tons, and' z' — $26$ tons.

757,D,Felicity's Big Secret Revealed,PROGRAMMING,"['bitmasks', 'dp']","The gym leaders were fascinated by the evolutions which took place at Felicity camp. So, they were curious to know about the secret behind evolving Pokemon. 

The organizers of the camp gave the gym leaders a PokeBlock, a sequence of *n* ingredients. Each ingredient can be of type 0 or 1. Now the organizers told the gym leaders that to evolve a Pokemon of type *k* (*k*<=≥<=2), they need to make a valid set of *k* cuts on the PokeBlock to get smaller blocks.

Suppose the given PokeBlock sequence is *b*0*b*1*b*2... *b**n*<=-<=1. You have a choice of making cuts at *n*<=+<=1 places, i.e., Before *b*0, between *b*0 and *b*1, between *b*1 and *b*2, ..., between *b**n*<=-<=2 and *b**n*<=-<=1, and after *b**n*<=-<=1.

The *n*<=+<=1 choices of making cuts are as follows (where a | denotes a possible cut):

Consider a sequence of *k* cuts. Now each pair of consecutive cuts will contain a binary string between them, formed from the ingredient types. The ingredients before the first cut and after the last cut are wasted, which is to say they are not considered. So there will be exactly *k*<=-<=1 such binary substrings. Every substring can be read as a binary number. Let *m* be the maximum number out of the obtained numbers. If all the obtained numbers are positive and the set of the obtained numbers contains all integers from 1 to *m*, then this set of cuts is said to be a valid set of cuts.

For example, suppose the given PokeBlock sequence is 101101001110 and we made 5 cuts in the following way:

So the 4 binary substrings obtained are: 11, 010, 01 and 1, which correspond to the numbers 3, 2, 1 and 1 respectively. Here *m*<==<=3, as it is the maximum value among the obtained numbers. And all the obtained numbers are positive and we have obtained all integers from 1 to *m*. Hence this set of cuts is a valid set of 5 cuts.

A Pokemon of type *k* will evolve only if the PokeBlock is cut using a valid set of *k* cuts. There can be many valid sets of the same size. Two valid sets of *k* cuts are considered different if there is a cut in one set which is not there in the other set.

Let *f*(*k*) denote the number of valid sets of *k* cuts. Find the value of . Since the value of *s* can be very large, output *s* modulo 109<=+<=7.","The input consists of two lines. The first line consists an integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=75) — the length of the PokeBlock. The next line contains the PokeBlock, a binary string of length *n*.","Output a single integer, containing the answer to the problem, i.e., the value of *s* modulo 109<=+<=7.","['4\n1011\n', '2\n10\n']","['10\n', '1\n']","In the first sample, the sets of valid cuts are:

Size 3: |1|01|1, |10|1|1, 10|1|1|, 1|01|1|.

Size 4: |10|1|1|, |1|01|1|.

Hence, *f*(2) = 4, *f*(3) = 4 and *f*(4) = 2. So, the value of *s* = 10.

In the second sample, the set of valid cuts is:

Size 2: |1|0.

Hence, *f*(2) = 1 and *f*(3) = 0. So, the value of *s* = 1.",OK,"mo = 10**9+7

You can find more formal definitions of a tree and a bipartite graph in the notes section below.

Dr. Evil gave Mahmoud and Ehab a tree consisting of *n* nodes and asked them to add edges to it in such a way, that the graph is still bipartite. Besides, after adding these edges the graph should be simple (doesn't contain loops or multiple edges). What is the maximum number of edges they can add?

Each edge of the graph is weighted, each weight is a positive integer.

The next day, ZS the Coder realized that some of the weights were erased! So he wants to reassign positive integer weight to each of the edges which weights were erased, so that the length of the shortest path between vertices *s* and *t* in the resulting graph is exactly *L*. Can you help him?","The first line contains five integers *n*,<=*m*,<=*L*,<=*s*,<=*t* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=1000,<=<=1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=10<=000,<=<=1<=≤<=*L*<=≤<=109,<=<=0<=≤<=*s*,<=*t*<=≤<=*n*<=-<=1,<=<=*s*<=≠<=*t*) — the number of vertices, number of edges, the desired length of shortest path, starting vertex and ending vertex respectively.

Then, *m* lines describing the edges of the graph follow. *i*-th of them contains three integers, *u**i*,<=*v**i*,<=*w**i* (0<=≤<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=≤<=*n*<=-<=1,<=<=*u**i*<=≠<=*v**i*,<=<=0<=≤<=*w**i*<=≤<=109). *u**i* and *v**i* denote the endpoints of the edge and *w**i* denotes its weight. If *w**i* is equal to 0 then the weight of the corresponding edge was erased.

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.","Print ""NO"" (without quotes) in the only line if it's not possible to assign the weights in a required way.

Otherwise, print ""YES"" in the first line. Next *m* lines should contain the edges of the resulting graph, with weights assigned to edges which weights were erased. *i*-th of them should contain three integers *u**i*, *v**i* and *w**i*, denoting an edge between vertices *u**i* and *v**i* of weight *w**i*. The edges of the new graph must coincide with the ones in the graph from the input.

The term is coming to an end and students start thinking about their grades. Today, a professor told his students that the grades for his course would be given out automatically  — he would calculate the simple average (arithmetic mean) of all grades given out for lab works this term and round to the nearest integer. The rounding would be done in favour of the student — $4.5$ would be rounded up to $5$ (as in example 3), but $4.4$ would be rounded down to $4$.

This does not bode well for Vasya who didn't think those lab works would influence anything, so he may receive a grade worse than $5$ (maybe even the dreaded $2$). However, the professor allowed him to redo some of his works of Vasya's choosing to increase his average grade. Vasya wants to redo as as few lab works as possible in order to get $5$ for the course. Of course, Vasya will get $5$ for the lab works he chooses to redo.

Alexander has *n* cards containing integers. Arthur wants to give Alexander exactly one more card with a number so that he could use the resulting *n*<=+<=1 cards to make an arithmetic progression (Alexander has to use all of his cards).

Arthur has already bought a card but he hasn't written a number on it.

He decided to find the longest subsequence of cards which satisfies the following conditions:
 -  the number of occurrences of each number from 1 to 8 in the subsequence doesn't differ by more then 1 from the number of occurrences of any other number. Formally, if there are *c**k* cards with number *k* on them in the subsequence, than for all pairs of integers  the condition |*c**i*<=-<=*c**j*|<=≤<=1 must hold. -  if there is at least one card with number *x* on it in the subsequence, then all cards with number *x* in this subsequence must form a continuous segment in it (but not necessarily a continuous segment in the original sequence). For example, the subsequence [1,<=1,<=2,<=2] satisfies this condition while the subsequence [1,<=2,<=2,<=1] doesn't. Note that [1,<=1,<=2,<=2] doesn't satisfy the first condition.

182,E,Wooden Fence,PROGRAMMING,['dp'],"Vasya has recently bought some land and decided to surround it with a wooden fence.

He went to a company called ""Wooden board"" that produces wooden boards for fences. Vasya read in the catalog of products that the company has at its disposal *n* different types of wood. The company uses the *i*-th type of wood to produce a board of this type that is a rectangular *a**i* by *b**i* block.

Vasya decided to order boards in this company and build a fence from them. It turned out that the storehouse of the company is so large that Vasya can order arbitrary number of boards of every type. Note that Vasya is allowed to turn the boards as he builds the fence. However, Vasya cannot turn square boards.

Vasya is required to construct a fence of length *l*, however, an arbitrary fence won't do. Vasya wants his fence to look beautiful. We'll say that a fence is beautiful if and only if the following two conditions are fulfilled:
 -  there are no two successive boards of the same type -  the first board of the fence has an arbitrary length, and the length of each subsequent board equals the width of the previous one 
In other words, the fence is considered beautiful, if the type of the *i*-th board in the fence is different from the *i*<=-<=1-th board's type; besides, the *i*-th board's length is equal to the *i*<=-<=1-th board's width (for all *i*, starting from 2).

Now Vasya wonders, how many variants of arranging a fence for his land exist. Your task is to count the number of different beautiful fences of length *l*.

Two fences will be considered the same if the corresponding sequences of fence boards types and rotations are the same, otherwise the fences are different. Since the sought number can be large enough, you need to calculate the answer modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).","The first line contains two integers *n* and *l* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100,<=1<=≤<=*l*<=≤<=3000) — the number of different board types and the fence length, correspondingly. Next *n* lines contain descriptions of board types: the *i*-th line contains two integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=≤<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=≤<=100) — the sizes of the board of the *i*-th type.

729,A,Interview with Oleg,PROGRAMMING,"['implementation', 'strings']","Polycarp has interviewed Oleg and has written the interview down without punctuation marks and spaces to save time. Thus, the interview is now a string *s* consisting of *n* lowercase English letters.

There is a filler word ogo in Oleg's speech. All words that can be obtained from ogo by adding go several times to the end of it are also considered to be fillers. For example, the words ogo, ogogo, ogogogo are fillers, but the words go, og, ogog, ogogog and oggo are not fillers.

The fillers have maximal size, for example, for ogogoo speech we can't consider ogo a filler and goo as a normal phrase. We should consider ogogo as a filler here.

To print the interview, Polycarp has to replace each of the fillers with three asterisks. Note that a filler word is replaced with exactly three asterisks regardless of its length.

Polycarp has dealt with this problem in no time. Can you do the same? The clock is ticking!","The first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100) — the length of the interview.

730,H,Delete Them,PROGRAMMING,"['constructive algorithms', 'implementation']","Polycarp is a beginner programmer. He is studying how to use a command line.

Polycarp faced the following problem. There are *n* files in a directory and he needs to delete some of them. Polycarp wants to run a single delete command with filename pattern as an argument. All the files to be deleted should match the pattern and all other files shouldn't match the pattern.

Polycarp doesn't know about an asterisk '*', the only special character he knows is a question mark '?' which matches any single character. All other characters in the pattern match themselves only.

Formally, a pattern matches a filename if and only if they have equal lengths and all characters in the corresponding positions are equal except when the character in the pattern is '?', in which case the corresponding filename character does not matter.

For example, the filename pattern ""a?ba?"":
 -  matches filenames ""aabaa"", ""abba."", ""a.ba9"" and ""a.ba.""; -  does not match filenames ""aaba"", ""abaab"", ""aabaaa"" and ""aabaa."". 
Help Polycarp find a pattern which matches files to be deleted and only them or report if there is no such pattern.","The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100) — the total number of files and the number of files to be deleted.

The following *n* lines contain filenames, single filename per line. All filenames are non-empty strings containing only lowercase English letters, digits and dots ('.'). The length of each filename doesn't exceed 100. It is guaranteed that all filenames are distinct.

The last line of the input contains *m* distinct integer numbers in ascending order *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**m* (1<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=*n*) — indices of files to be deleted. All files are indexed from 1 to *n* in order of their appearance in the input.","If the required pattern exists, print ""Yes"" in the first line of the output.

For example, during yesterday sitting the Berland Parliament approved as much as *n* laws (each law has been assigned a unique number from 1 to *n*). Today all these laws were put on the table of the President of Berland, G.W. Boosch, to be signed.

This time mr. Boosch plans to sign 2*k* laws. He decided to choose exactly two non-intersecting segments of integers from 1 to *n* of length *k* and sign all laws, whose numbers fall into these segments. More formally, mr. Boosch is going to choose two integers *a*, *b* (1<=≤<=*a*<=≤<=*b*<=≤<=*n*<=-<=*k*<=+<=1,<=*b*<=-<=*a*<=≥<=*k*) and sign all laws with numbers lying in the segments [*a*; *a*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] and [*b*; *b*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] (borders are included).

As mr. Boosch chooses the laws to sign, he of course considers the public opinion. Allberland Public Opinion Study Centre (APOSC) conducted opinion polls among the citizens, processed the results into a report and gave it to the president. The report contains the absurdity value for each law, in the public opinion. As mr. Boosch is a real patriot, he is keen on signing the laws with the maximum total absurdity. Help him.","The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=2·105, 0<=&lt;<=2*k*<=≤<=*n*) — the number of laws accepted by the parliament and the length of one segment in the law list, correspondingly. The next line contains *n* integers *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n* — the absurdity of each law (1<=≤<=*x**i*<=≤<=109).","Print two integers *a*, *b* — the beginning of segments that mr. Boosch should choose. That means that the president signs laws with numbers from segments [*a*; *a*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] and [*b*; *b*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1].

721,A,One-dimensional Japanese Crossword,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Recently Adaltik discovered japanese crosswords. Japanese crossword is a picture, represented as a table sized *a*<=×<=*b* squares, and each square is colored white or black. There are integers to the left of the rows and to the top of the columns, encrypting the corresponding row or column. The number of integers represents how many groups of black squares there are in corresponding row or column, and the integers themselves represents the number of consecutive black squares in corresponding group (you can find more detailed explanation in Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_crossword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_crossword)).

Adaltik decided that the general case of japanese crossword is too complicated and drew a row consisting of *n* squares (e.g. japanese crossword sized 1<=×<=*n*), which he wants to encrypt in the same way as in japanese crossword.

As we know from the previous problem, the nervous system of a zombie consists of *n* brains and *m* brain connectors joining some pairs of brains together. It was observed that the intellectual abilities of a zombie depend mainly on the topology of its nervous system. More precisely, we define the distance between two brains *u* and *v* (1<=≤<=*u*,<=*v*<=≤<=*n*) as the minimum number of brain connectors used when transmitting a thought between these two brains. The brain latency of a zombie is defined to be the maximum distance between any two of its brains. Researchers conjecture that the brain latency is the crucial parameter which determines how smart a given zombie is. Help them test this conjecture by writing a program to compute brain latencies of nervous systems.

Because the name of technology was already printed on all devices, the Gogol's director decided to replace some characters in AI name with ""#"".

61,A,Ultra-Fast Mathematician,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Shapur was an extremely gifted student. He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.

One day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.

In his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.

Shapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length ∞ (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.

Now you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.",There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number.

There is exactly one relative living in each vertex of each tree, they have unique ids from 1 to *n*. For each Ball *i* we know the id of its most distant relative living on the same tree. If there are several such vertices, we only know the value of the one with smallest id among those.

The second line contains a sequence *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n* of length *n*, where (1<=≤<=*p**i*<=≤<=*n*) holds and *p**i* denotes the most distant from Ball *i* relative living on the same tree. If there are several most distant relatives living on the same tree, *p**i* is the id of one with the smallest id.

It's guaranteed that the sequence *p* corresponds to some valid forest.

Hacking: To hack someone, you should provide a correct forest as a test. The sequence *p* will be calculated according to the forest and given to the solution you try to hack as input. Use the following format:

In the first line, output the integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=104) — the number of Balls and the integer *m* (0<=≤<=*m*<=&lt;<=*n*) — the total number of edges in the forest. Then *m* lines should follow. The *i*-th of them should contain two integers *a**i* and *b**i* and represent an edge between vertices in which relatives *a**i* and *b**i* live. For example, the first sample is written as follows:",You should output the number of trees in the forest where PolandBall lives.,"['5\n2 1 5 3 3', '1\n1\n']","['2', '1']","In the first sample testcase, possible forest is: 1-2 3-4-5.

227,B,Effective Approach,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.

According to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.

Vasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.

To finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.

But the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.","The first line contains integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105) — the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the elements of array. 

The third line contains integer *m* (1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=105) — the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=≤<=*b**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.","Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs. Separate the numbers by spaces.

In the second sample, on the contrary, Vasya's approach will need two comparisons (first with 1-st element, and then with the 2-nd), and Petya's approach will find the required value in one comparison (the first comparison with the 2-nd element).",TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED,"from sys import stdin, stdout

Empty cells are marked with '.', impassable cells are marked with '*'. Let's call two empty cells adjacent if they share a side.

Let's call a connected component any non-extendible set of cells such that any two of them are connected by the path of adjacent cells. It is a typical well-known definition of a connected component.

For each impassable cell (*x*,<=*y*) imagine that it is an empty cell (all other cells remain unchanged) and find the size (the number of cells) of the connected component which contains (*x*,<=*y*). You should do it for each impassable cell independently.

The answer should be printed as a matrix with *n* rows and *m* columns. The *j*-th symbol of the *i*-th row should be ""."" if the cell is empty at the start. Otherwise the *j*-th symbol of the *i*-th row should contain the only digit —- the answer modulo 10. The matrix should be printed without any spaces.

To make your output faster it is recommended to build the output as an array of *n* strings having length *m* and print it as a sequence of lines. It will be much faster than writing character-by-character.

553,B,Kyoya and Permutation,PROGRAMMING,"['binary search', 'combinatorics', 'constructive algorithms', 'greedy', 'implementation', 'math']","Let's define the permutation of length *n* as an array *p*<==<=[*p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n*] consisting of *n* distinct integers from range from 1 to *n*. We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value *p*1, value 2 into the value *p*2 and so on.

Kyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a permutation. A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle). The cyclic representation is a representation of *p* as a collection of cycles forming *p*. For example, permutation *p*<==<=[4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] has a cyclic representation that looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are swapped, and 5 remains in place. 

Permutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya defines the standard cyclic representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first. Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation of [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] is (421)(5)(63).

Now, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For instance, [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] will become [4,<=2,<=1,<=5,<=6,<=3].

Kyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of length *n* that do not change in a list in lexicographic order.

Each floor has $m$ sections with a single corridor connecting all of them. The sections are enumerated from $1$ to $m$ along the corridor, and all sections with equal numbers on different floors are located exactly one above the other. Thus, the hotel can be represented as a rectangle of height $n$ and width $m$. We can denote sections with pairs of integers $(i, j)$, where $i$ is the floor, and $j$ is the section number on the floor.

The guests can walk along the corridor on each floor, use stairs and elevators. Each stairs or elevator occupies all sections $(1, x)$, $(2, x)$, $\ldots$, $(n, x)$ for some $x$ between $1$ and $m$. All sections not occupied with stairs or elevators contain guest rooms. It takes one time unit to move between neighboring sections on the same floor or to move one floor up or down using stairs. It takes one time unit to move up to $v$ floors in any direction using an elevator. You can assume you don't have to wait for an elevator, and the time needed to enter or exit an elevator is negligible.

You are to process $q$ queries. Each query is a question ""what is the minimum time needed to go from a room in section $(x_1, y_1)$ to a room in section $(x_2, y_2)$?""","The first line contains five integers $n, m, c_l, c_e, v$ ($2 \leq n, m \leq 10^8$, $0 \leq c_l, c_e \leq 10^5$, $1 \leq c_l + c_e \leq m - 1$, $1 \leq v \leq n - 1$) — the number of floors and section on each floor, the number of stairs, the number of elevators and the maximum speed of an elevator, respectively.

The second line contains $c_l$ integers $l_1, \ldots, l_{c_l}$ in increasing order ($1 \leq l_i \leq m$), denoting the positions of the stairs. If $c_l = 0$, the second line is empty.

The third line contains $c_e$ integers $e_1, \ldots, e_{c_e}$ in increasing order, denoting the elevators positions in the same format. It is guaranteed that all integers $l_i$ and $e_i$ are distinct.

The fourth line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \leq q \leq 10^5$) — the number of queries.

The next $q$ lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains four integers $x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$ ($1 \leq x_1, x_2 \leq n$, $1 \leq y_1, y_2 \leq m$) — the coordinates of starting and finishing sections for the query. It is guaranteed that the starting and finishing sections are distinct.

Let us remind you the rules of moving chess pieces. A chessboard is 64 square fields organized into an 8<=×<=8 table. A field is represented by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*) — the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:
 -  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically. -  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally. -  A king moves one field in any direction — horizontally, vertically or diagonally. 
Petya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2)? At that, we assume that there are no more pieces besides this one on the board. Help him solve this problem.","The input contains four integers *r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2 (1<=≤<=*r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2<=≤<=8) — the coordinates of the starting and the final field. The starting field doesn't coincide with the final one.

You can assume that the chessboard rows are numbered from top to bottom 1 through 8, and the columns are numbered from left to right 1 through 8.","Print three space-separated integers: the minimum number of moves the rook, the bishop and the king (in this order) is needed to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2).

903,B,The Modcrab,PROGRAMMING,"['greedy', 'implementation']","Vova is again playing some computer game, now an RPG. In the game Vova's character received a quest: to slay the fearsome monster called Modcrab.

After two hours of playing the game Vova has tracked the monster and analyzed its tactics. The Modcrab has *h*2 health points and an attack power of *a*2. Knowing that, Vova has decided to buy a lot of strong healing potions and to prepare for battle.

Vova's character has *h*1 health points and an attack power of *a*1. Also he has a large supply of healing potions, each of which increases his current amount of health points by *c*1 when Vova drinks a potion. All potions are identical to each other. It is guaranteed that *c*1<=&gt;<=*a*2.

The battle consists of multiple phases. In the beginning of each phase, Vova can either attack the monster (thus reducing its health by *a*1) or drink a healing potion (it increases Vova's health by *c*1; Vova's health can exceed *h*1). Then, if the battle is not over yet, the Modcrab attacks Vova, reducing his health by *a*2. The battle ends when Vova's (or Modcrab's) health drops to 0 or lower. It is possible that the battle ends in a middle of a phase after Vova's attack.

Of course, Vova wants to win the fight. But also he wants to do it as fast as possible. So he wants to make up a strategy that will allow him to win the fight after the minimum possible number of phases.

Help Vova to make up a strategy! You may assume that Vova never runs out of healing potions, and that he can always win.","The first line contains three integers *h*1, *a*1, *c*1 (1<=≤<=*h*1,<=*a*1<=≤<=100, 2<=≤<=*c*1<=≤<=100) — Vova's health, Vova's attack power and the healing power of a potion.

The second line contains two integers *h*2, *a*2 (1<=≤<=*h*2<=≤<=100, 1<=≤<=*a*2<=&lt;<=*c*1) — the Modcrab's health and his attack power.","In the first line print one integer *n* denoting the minimum number of phases required to win the battle.

Then print *n* lines. *i*-th line must be equal to HEAL if Vova drinks a potion in *i*-th phase, or STRIKE if he attacks the Modcrab.

The strategy must be valid: Vova's character must not be defeated before slaying the Modcrab, and the monster's health must be 0 or lower after Vova's last action.

If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.","['10 6 100\n17 5\n', '11 6 100\n12 5\n']","['4\nSTRIKE\nHEAL\nSTRIKE\nSTRIKE\n', '2\nSTRIKE\nSTRIKE\n']","In the first example Vova's character must heal before or after his first attack. Otherwise his health will drop to zero in 2 phases while he needs 3 strikes to win.

In the second example no healing needed, two strikes are enough to get monster to zero health and win with 6 health left.",WRONG_ANSWER,"import bisect

873,D,Merge Sort,PROGRAMMING,"['constructive algorithms', 'divide and conquer']","Merge sort is a well-known sorting algorithm. The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:
 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=≤<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=≤<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. 
The array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).

The number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* — *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.

Ivan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.

7,A,Kalevitch and Chess,PROGRAMMING,"['brute force', 'constructive algorithms']","A famous Berland's painter Kalevitch likes to shock the public. One of his last obsessions is chess. For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards.

As before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8<=×<=8 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke.

Kalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client's requirements.

It goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything — for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's needs. You are asked to help Kalevitch with this task.","The input file contains 8 lines, each of the lines contains 8 characters.

61,C,Capture Valerian,PROGRAMMING,['math'],"It's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.

Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.

Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.

Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number *a*. The second part is either an integer number *b* or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer *c* and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.

*c* is an integer written in base *a*, to open the door we should write it in base *b*. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!

Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:

Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.:
-  I=1-  V=5-  X=10-  L=50-  C=100-  D=500-  M=1000
Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1,<=000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.

Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.

Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.","The first line contains two integers *a* and *b* (2<=≤<=*a*,<=*b*<=≤<=25). Only *b* may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.

The next line contains a single non-negative integer *c* in base *a* which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. 

It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.",Write a single line that contains integer *c* in base *b*.

754,B,Ilya and tic-tac-toe game,PROGRAMMING,"['brute force', 'implementation']","Ilya is an experienced player in tic-tac-toe on the 4<=×<=4 field. He always starts and plays with Xs. He played a lot of games today with his friend Arseny. The friends became tired and didn't finish the last game. It was Ilya's turn in the game when they left it. Determine whether Ilya could have won the game by making single turn or not. 

The rules of tic-tac-toe on the 4<=×<=4 field are as follows. Before the first turn all the field cells are empty. The two players take turns placing their signs into empty cells (the first player places Xs, the second player places Os). The player who places Xs goes first, the another one goes second. The winner is the player who first gets three of his signs in a row next to each other (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).","The tic-tac-toe position is given in four lines.

Each of these lines contains four characters. Each character is '.' (empty cell), 'x' (lowercase English letter x), or 'o' (lowercase English letter o). It is guaranteed that the position is reachable playing tic-tac-toe, and it is Ilya's turn now (in particular, it means that the game is not finished). It is possible that all the cells are empty, it means that the friends left without making single turn.","Print single line: ""YES"" in case Ilya could have won by making single turn, and ""NO"" otherwise.","['xx..\n.oo.\nx...\noox.\n', 'x.ox\nox..\nx.o.\noo.x\n', 'x..x\n..oo\no...\nx.xo\n', 'o.x.\no...\n.x..\nooxx\n']","['YES\n', 'NO\n', 'YES\n', 'NO\n']","In the first example Ilya had two winning moves: to the empty cell in the left column and to the leftmost empty cell in the first row.

After that, the water will flow out from the non-blocked holes proportionally to their sizes $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n$.

But there were so many of them that Gerald lost the track of his counting. Help the boy count the triangles.","The first and the single line of the input contains 6 space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=*a*3,<=*a*4,<=*a*5 and *a*6 (1<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=1000) — the lengths of the sides of the hexagons in centimeters in the clockwise order.

7,B,Memory Manager,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet — the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: 
 -  alloc n — to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x — to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment — to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; 
The memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.

The first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.

The second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.

The last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.

In the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.

You are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.","The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=≤<=*t*<=≤<=100;1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=100), where *t* — the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* — the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.","Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession. Output lines should go in the same order in which the operations are processed. Successful procession of alloc operation should return integers, starting with 1, as the identifiers of the allocated blocks.",['6 10\nalloc 5\nalloc 3\nerase 1\nalloc 6\ndefragment\nalloc 6\n'],['1\n2\nNULL\n3\n'],none,WRONG_ANSWER,"def main():

You are given string *s* consisting of lowercase English letters only. Find its lexicographically largest palindromic subsequence.

We'll call a non-empty string *s*[*p*1*p*2... *p**k*] = *s**p*1*s**p*2... *s**p**k* (1 <=≤<= *p*1<=&lt;<=*p*2<=&lt;<=...<=&lt;<=*p**k* <=≤<= |*s*|) a subsequence of string *s* = *s*1*s*2... *s*|*s*|, where |*s*| is the length of string *s*. For example, strings ""abcb"", ""b"" and ""abacaba"" are subsequences of string ""abacaba"".

String *x* = *x*1*x*2... *x*|*x*| is lexicographically larger than string *y* = *y*1*y*2... *y*|*y*| if either |*x*| &gt; |*y*| and *x*1<==<=*y*1, *x*2<==<=*y*2, ...,<=*x*|*y*|<==<=*y*|*y*|, or there exists such number *r* (*r*<=&lt;<=|*x*|, *r*<=&lt;<=|*y*|) that *x*1<==<=*y*1, *x*2<==<=*y*2, ..., *x**r*<==<=*y**r* and *x**r*<=<=+<=<=1<=&gt;<=*y**r*<=<=+<=<=1. Characters in the strings are compared according to their ASCII codes. For example, string ""ranger"" is lexicographically larger than string ""racecar"" and string ""poster"" is lexicographically larger than string ""post"".

String *s* = *s*1*s*2... *s*|*s*| is a palindrome if it matches string *rev*(*s*) = *s*|*s*|*s*|*s*|<=-<=1... *s*1. In other words, a string is a palindrome if it reads the same way from left to right and from right to left.

Vitaly calls a positive integer good, if the decimal representation of this integer only contains digits *a* and *b*. Vitaly calls a good number excellent, if the sum of its digits is a good number.

For example, let's say that Vitaly's favourite digits are 1 and 3, then number 12 isn't good and numbers 13 or 311 are. Also, number 111 is excellent and number 11 isn't. 

Now Vitaly is wondering, how many excellent numbers of length exactly *n* are there. As this number can be rather large, he asks you to count the remainder after dividing it by 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).

 -  each comma is followed by exactly one space (if the comma is the last character in the string, this rule does not apply to it), -  each ""three dots"" term is preceded by exactly one space (if the dots are at the beginning of the string, this rule does not apply to the term), -  if two consecutive numbers were separated by spaces only (one or more), then exactly one of them should be left, -  there should not be other spaces.

To make the round good, he needs to put at least *n* problems there. Besides, he needs to have at least one problem with complexity exactly *a*1, at least one with complexity exactly *a*2, ..., and at least one with complexity exactly *a**n*. Of course, the round can also have problems with other complexities.

George has a poor imagination. It's easier for him to make some already prepared problem simpler than to come up with a new one and prepare it. George is magnificent at simplifying problems. He can simplify any already prepared problem with complexity *c* to any positive integer complexity *d* (*c*<=≥<=*d*), by changing limits on the input data.

However, nothing is so simple. George understood that even if he simplifies some problems, he can run out of problems for a good round.

If at the end of the game there is only one player with the maximum number of points, he is the winner. The situation becomes more difficult if the number of such players is more than one. During each round a player gains or loses a particular number of points. In the course of the game the number of points is registered in the line ""name score"", where name is a player's name, and score is the number of points gained in this round, which is an integer number. If score is negative, this means that the player has lost in the round. So, if two or more players have the maximum number of points (say, it equals to *m*) at the end of the game, than wins the one of them who scored at least *m* points first.

When viewed from the side, Mike's hard drive is an endless array of tracks. The tracks of the array are numbered from left to right with integers, starting with 1. In the initial state the *i*-th reading head is above the track number *h**i*. For each of the reading heads, the hard drive's firmware can move the head exactly one track to the right or to the left, or leave it on the current track. During the operation each head's movement does not affect the movement of the other heads: the heads can change their relative order; there can be multiple reading heads above any of the tracks. A track is considered read if at least one head has visited this track. In particular, all of the tracks numbered *h*1, *h*2, ..., *h**n* have been read at the beginning of the operation.

Mike needs to read the data on *m* distinct tracks with numbers *p*1, *p*2, ..., *p**m*. Determine the minimum time the hard drive firmware needs to move the heads and read all the given tracks. Note that an arbitrary number of other tracks can also be read.","The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers *n*, *m* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=105) — the number of disk heads and the number of tracks to read, accordingly. The second line contains *n* distinct integers *h**i* in ascending order (1<=≤<=*h**i*<=≤<=1010, *h**i*<=&lt;<=*h**i*<=+<=1) — the initial positions of the heads. The third line contains *m* distinct integers *p**i* in ascending order (1<=≤<=*p**i*<=≤<=1010, *p**i*<=&lt;<=*p**i*<=+<=1) - the numbers of tracks to read.

822,A,I'm bored with life,PROGRAMMING,"['implementation', 'math', 'number theory']","Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vičkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vičkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!

Leha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers ""*A* factorial"" and ""*B* factorial"". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*.

601,A,The Two Routes,PROGRAMMING,"['graphs', 'shortest paths']","In Absurdistan, there are *n* towns (numbered 1 through *n*) and *m* bidirectional railways. There is also an absurdly simple road network — for each pair of different towns *x* and *y*, there is a bidirectional road between towns *x* and *y* if and only if there is no railway between them. Travelling to a different town using one railway or one road always takes exactly one hour.

A train and a bus leave town 1 at the same time. They both have the same destination, town *n*, and don't make any stops on the way (but they can wait in town *n*). The train can move only along railways and the bus can move only along roads.

You've been asked to plan out routes for the vehicles; each route can use any road/railway multiple times. One of the most important aspects to consider is safety — in order to avoid accidents at railway crossings, the train and the bus must not arrive at the same town (except town *n*) simultaneously.

Under these constraints, what is the minimum number of hours needed for both vehicles to reach town *n* (the maximum of arrival times of the bus and the train)? Note, that bus and train are not required to arrive to the town *n* at the same moment of time, but are allowed to do so.","The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=400, 0<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=*n*(*n*<=-<=1)<=/<=2) — the number of towns and the number of railways respectively.

Sam would spend the whole summer stocking hay to feed Dawn in winter. Sam scythed hay and put it into haystack. As Sam was a bright farmer, he tried to make the process of storing hay simpler and more convenient to use. He collected the hay into cubical hay blocks of the same size. Then he stored the blocks in his barn. After a summer spent in hard toil Sam stored *A*·*B*·*C* hay blocks and stored them in a barn as a rectangular parallelepiped *A* layers high. Each layer had *B* rows and each row had *C* blocks.

At the end of the autumn Sam came into the barn to admire one more time the hay he'd been stacking during this hard summer. Unfortunately, Sam was horrified to see that the hay blocks had been carelessly scattered around the barn. The place was a complete mess. As it turned out, thieves had sneaked into the barn. They completely dissembled and took away a layer of blocks from the parallelepiped's front, back, top and sides. As a result, the barn only had a parallelepiped containing (*A*<=-<=1)<=×<=(*B*<=-<=2)<=×<=(*C*<=-<=2) hay blocks. To hide the evidence of the crime, the thieves had dissembled the parallelepiped into single 1<=×<=1<=×<=1 blocks and scattered them around the barn.

Pasha has installed a new game to his phone. The goal of the game is following. There is a rectangular field consisting of *n* row with *m* pixels in each row. Initially, all the pixels are colored white. In one move, Pasha can choose any pixel and color it black. In particular, he can choose the pixel that is already black, then after the boy's move the pixel does not change, that is, it remains black. Pasha loses the game when a 2<=×<=2 square consisting of black pixels is formed. 

Pasha has made a plan of *k* moves, according to which he will paint pixels. Each turn in his plan is represented as a pair of numbers *i* and *j*, denoting respectively the row and the column of the pixel to be colored on the current move.

Determine whether Pasha loses if he acts in accordance with his plan, and if he does, on what move the 2<=×<=2 square consisting of black pixels is formed.","The first line of the input contains three integers *n*,<=*m*,<=*k* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=1000, 1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=105) — the number of rows, the number of columns and the number of moves that Pasha is going to perform. 

The next *k* lines contain Pasha's moves in the order he makes them.

Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell.

A string *a* is alphabetically earlier than a string *b*, if *a* is a prefix of *b*, or *a* and *b* coincide up to some position, and then *a* has a letter that is alphabetically earlier than the corresponding letter in *b*: ""a"" and ""ab"" are alphabetically earlier than ""ac"" but ""b"" and ""ba"" are alphabetically later than ""ac"".","The input consists of a single line containing two space-separated strings: the first and the last names.

Allen had a bit too much to drink at the bar, which is at the origin. There are $n$ vectors $\vec{v_1}, \vec{v_2}, \cdots, \vec{v_n}$. Allen will make $n$ moves. As Allen's sense of direction is impaired, during the $i$-th move he will either move in the direction $\vec{v_i}$ or $-\vec{v_i}$. In other words, if his position is currently $p = (x, y)$, he will either move to $p + \vec{v_i}$ or $p - \vec{v_i}$.

Allen doesn't want to wander too far from home (which happens to also be the bar).

33,A,What is for dinner?,PROGRAMMING,"['greedy', 'implementation']","In one little known, but very beautiful country called Waterland, lives a lovely shark Valerie. Like all the sharks, she has several rows of teeth, and feeds on crucians. One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are ""relaxing"".

For a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap).

It turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again. 

Unhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her. For sure, the shark couldn't say no to her favourite meal, but she had no desire to go back to the dentist. That's why she decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that the viability of no tooth becomes negative. 

As Valerie is not good at mathematics, she asked you to help her to find out the total amount of crucians that she can consume for dinner.

We should remind you that while eating one crucian Valerie uses exactly one row of teeth and the viability of each tooth from this row decreases by one.","The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=1000,<=0<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=106) — total amount of Valerie's teeth, amount of tooth rows and amount of crucians in Valerie's portion for dinner.

You know that each card has a lowercase English letter on one side and a digit on the other.

Currently, your friend has laid out the cards on a table so only one side of each card is visible.

You would like to know if the following statement is true for cards that your friend owns: ""If a card has a vowel on one side, then it has an even digit on the other side."" More specifically, a vowel is one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' or 'u', and even digit is one of '0', '2', '4', '6' or '8'.

For example, if a card has 'a' on one side, and '6' on the other side, then this statement is true for it. Also, the statement is true, for example, for a card with 'b' and '4', and for a card with 'b' and '3' (since the letter is not a vowel). The statement is false, for example, for card with 'e' and '5'. You are interested if the statement is true for all cards. In particular, if no card has a vowel, the statement is true.

To determine this, you can flip over some cards to reveal the other side. You would like to know what is the minimum number of cards you need to flip in the worst case in order to verify that the statement is true.","The first and only line of input will contain a string *s* (1<=≤<=|*s*|<=≤<=50), denoting the sides of the cards that you can see on the table currently.

Crucial moment is just around the corner: Gogol is ready to release it's new tablet Lastus 3000.

This new device is equipped with specially designed artificial intelligence (AI). Employees of Pineapple did their best to postpone the release of Lastus 3000 as long as possible. Finally, they found out, that the name of the new artificial intelligence is similar to the name of the phone, that Pineapple released 200 years ago. As all rights on its name belong to Pineapple, they stand on changing the name of Gogol's artificial intelligence.

Pineapple insists, that the name of their phone occurs in the name of AI as a substring. Because the name of technology was already printed on all devices, the Gogol's director decided to replace some characters in AI name with ""#"". As this operation is pretty expensive, you should find the minimum number of characters to replace with ""#"", such that the name of AI doesn't contain the name of the phone as a substring.

You are given string *s* consisting of lowercase English letters only. Find its lexicographically largest palindromic subsequence.

We'll call a non-empty string *s*[*p*1*p*2... *p**k*] = *s**p*1*s**p*2... *s**p**k* (1 <=≤<= *p*1<=&lt;<=*p*2<=&lt;<=...<=&lt;<=*p**k* <=≤<= |*s*|) a subsequence of string *s* = *s*1*s*2... *s*|*s*|, where |*s*| is the length of string *s*. For example, strings ""abcb"", ""b"" and ""abacaba"" are subsequences of string ""abacaba"".

String *x* = *x*1*x*2... *x*|*x*| is lexicographically larger than string *y* = *y*1*y*2... *y*|*y*| if either |*x*| &gt; |*y*| and *x*1<==<=*y*1, *x*2<==<=*y*2, ...,<=*x*|*y*|<==<=*y*|*y*|, or there exists such number *r* (*r*<=&lt;<=|*x*|, *r*<=&lt;<=|*y*|) that *x*1<==<=*y*1, *x*2<==<=*y*2, ..., *x**r*<==<=*y**r* and *x**r*<=<=+<=<=1<=&gt;<=*y**r*<=<=+<=<=1. Characters in the strings are compared according to their ASCII codes. For example, string ""ranger"" is lexicographically larger than string ""racecar"" and string ""poster"" is lexicographically larger than string ""post"".

String *s* = *s*1*s*2... *s*|*s*| is a palindrome if it matches string *rev*(*s*) = *s*|*s*|*s*|*s*|<=-<=1... *s*1.

In particular, he can choose the pixel that is already black, then after the boy's move the pixel does not change, that is, it remains black. Pasha loses the game when a 2<=×<=2 square consisting of black pixels is formed. 

Pasha has made a plan of *k* moves, according to which he will paint pixels. Each turn in his plan is represented as a pair of numbers *i* and *j*, denoting respectively the row and the column of the pixel to be colored on the current move.

Determine whether Pasha loses if he acts in accordance with his plan, and if he does, on what move the 2<=×<=2 square consisting of black pixels is formed.","The first line of the input contains three integers *n*,<=*m*,<=*k* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=1000, 1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=105) — the number of rows, the number of columns and the number of moves that Pasha is going to perform. 

The next *k* lines contain Pasha's moves in the order he makes them. Each line contains two integers *i* and *j* (1<=≤<=*i*<=≤<=*n*, 1<=≤<=*j*<=≤<=*m*), representing the row number and column number of the pixel that was painted during a move.","If Pasha loses, print the number of the move when the 2<=×<=2 square consisting of black pixels is formed.

As the lecture was boring, Vasya decided to complete the picture by composing a graph *G* with the following properties: 
 -  *G* has exactly *n* vertices, numbered from 1 to *n*. -  For all pairs of vertices *i* and *j*, where *i*<=≠<=*j*, there is an edge connecting them if and only if characters *s**i* and *s**j* are either equal or neighbouring in the alphabet. That is, letters in pairs ""a""-""b"" and ""b""-""c"" are neighbouring, while letters ""a""-""c"" are not. 
Vasya painted the resulting graph near the string and then erased the string. Next day Vasya's friend Petya came to a lecture and found some graph at his desk. He had heard of Vasya's adventure and now he wants to find out whether it could be the original graph *G*, painted by Vasya.

If the string *s* exists, then print it on the second line of the output.

104,A,Blackjack,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"One rainy gloomy evening when all modules hid in the nearby cafes to drink hot energetic cocktails, the Hexadecimal virus decided to fly over the Mainframe to look for a Great Idea. And she has found one!

Why not make her own Codeforces, with blackjack and other really cool stuff? Many people will surely be willing to visit this splendid shrine of high culture.

In Mainframe a standard pack of 52 cards is used to play blackjack. The pack contains cards of 13 values: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jacks, queens, kings and aces. Each value also exists in one of four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. Also, each card earns some value in points assigned to it: cards with value from two to ten earn from 2 to 10 points, correspondingly. An ace can either earn 1 or 11, whatever the player wishes. The picture cards (king, queen and jack) earn 10 points. The number of points a card earns does not depend on the suit. The rules of the game are very simple. The player gets two cards, if the sum of points of those cards equals *n*, then the player wins, otherwise the player loses.

The player has already got the first card, it's the queen of spades. To evaluate chances for victory, you should determine how many ways there are to get the second card so that the sum of points exactly equals *n*.",The only line contains *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=25) — the required sum of points.,Print the numbers of ways to get the second card in the required way if the first card is the queen of spades.,"['12\n', '20\n', '10\n']","['4', '15', '0']","In the first sample only four two's of different suits can earn the required sum of points.

Each of the stages is defined by a lowercase Latin letter. This way, the rocket can be described by the string — concatenation of letters, which correspond to the stages.

There are $n$ stages available. The rocket must contain exactly $k$ of them. Stages in the rocket should be ordered by their weight. So, after the stage with some letter can go only stage with a letter, which is at least two positions after in the alphabet (skipping one letter in between, or even more). For example, after letter 'c' can't go letters 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd', but can go letters 'e', 'f', ..., 'z'.

For the rocket to fly as far as possible, its weight should be minimal. The weight of the rocket is equal to the sum of the weights of its stages. The weight of the stage is the number of its letter in the alphabet. For example, the stage 'a 'weighs one ton,' b 'weighs two tons, and' z' — $26$ tons.

Build the rocket with the minimal weight or determine, that it is impossible to build a rocket at all. Each stage can be used at most once.","The first line of input contains two integers — $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 50$) – the number of available stages and the number of stages to use in the rocket.

The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.

Shapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length ∞ (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.

Now you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.",There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number. It is guaranteed that the numbers are made from 0 and 1 only and that their length is same. The numbers may start with 0. The length of each number doesn't exceed 100.,Write one line — the corresponding answer. Do not omit the leading 0s.,"['1010100\n0100101\n', '000\n111\n', '1110\n1010\n', '01110\n01100\n']","['1110001\n', '111\n', '0100\n', '00010\n']",none,OK,"def ultra(n,m):

""Once upon a time, there lived an emperor. He was very rich and had much grain. One day he ordered to build a huge barn to put there all his grain. Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through. Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...""

More formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of *n* grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:
 -  *m* grains are brought to the barn. If *m* grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account). -  Sparrows come and eat grain. In the *i*-th day *i* sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. 
Anton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn. Anton doesn't know when the fairy tale ends, so he asked you to determine, by the end of which day the barn will become empty for the first time. Help Anton and write a program that will determine the number of that day!","The only line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=1018) — the capacity of the barn and the number of grains that are brought every day.",Output one integer — the number of the day when the barn will become empty for the first time.

 -  At the beginning of the first day grain is brought to the barn.

The barn becomes full and one grain doesn't fit to it. -  At the end of the second day two sparrows come. 5 - 2 = 3 grains remain. -  At the beginning of the third day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full again. -  At the end of the third day three sparrows come and eat grain. 5 - 3 = 2 grains remain. -  At the beginning of the fourth day grain is brought again. 2 + 2 = 4 grains remain. -  At the end of the fourth day four sparrows come and eat grain. 4 - 4 = 0 grains remain.

Alex enjoyed playing Minesweeper that time. He imagined that he saved world from bombs planted by terrorists, but he rarely won.

Alex has grown up since then, so he easily wins the most difficult levels. This quickly bored him, and he thought: what if the computer gave him invalid fields in the childhood and Alex could not win because of it?

He needs your help to check it.

A Minesweeper field is a rectangle $n \times m$, where each cell is either empty, or contains a digit from $1$ to $8$, or a bomb. The field is valid if for each cell: 
 -  if there is a digit $k$ in the cell, then exactly $k$ neighboring cells have bombs. -  if the cell is empty, then all neighboring cells have no bombs. 
Two cells are neighbors if they have a common side or a corner (i. e. a cell has at most $8$ neighboring cells).","The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 100$) — the sizes of the field.

The next $n$ lines contain the description of the field. Each line contains $m$ characters, each of them is ""."" (if this cell is empty), ""*"" (if there is bomb in this cell), or a digit from $1$ to $8$, inclusive.","Print ""YES"", if the field is valid and ""NO"" otherwise.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrarily.","['3 3\n111\n1*1\n111\n', '2 4\n*.*.\n1211\n']","['YES', 'NO']","In the second example the answer is ""NO"" because, if the positions of the bombs are preserved, the first line of the field should be *2*1.

Maxim has a wallet which can be represented as an array of integers. His wallet contains $m$ bills, the $j$-th bill has value $a_j$.

Games in the shop are ordered from left to right, Maxim tries to buy every game in that order.

When Maxim stands at the position $i$ in the shop, he takes the first bill from his wallet (if his wallet is empty then he proceeds to the next position immediately) and tries to buy the $i$-th game using this bill. After Maxim tried to buy the $n$-th game, he leaves the shop.

Maxim buys the $i$-th game if and only if the value of the first bill (which he takes) from his wallet is greater or equal to the cost of the $i$-th game. If he successfully buys the $i$-th game, the first bill from his wallet disappears and the next bill becomes first. Otherwise Maxim leaves the first bill in his wallet (this bill still remains the first one) and proceeds to the next game.

For example, for array $c = [2, 4, 5, 2, 4]$ and array $a = [5, 3, 4, 6]$ the following process takes place: Maxim buys the first game using the first bill (its value is $5$), the bill disappears, after that the second bill (with value $3$) becomes the first one in Maxim's wallet, then Maxim doesn't buy the second game because $c_2 &gt; a_2$, the same with the third game, then he buys the fourth game using the bill of value $a_2$ (the third bill becomes the first one in Maxim's wallet) and buys the fifth game using the bill of value $a_3$.

Under these constraints, what is the minimum number of hours needed for both vehicles to reach town *n* (the maximum of arrival times of the bus and the train)?

A palindromic number is another matter. It is aesthetically pleasing, and it has a number of remarkable properties. Help Rikhail to convince the scientific community in this!

Let us remind you that a number is called prime if it is integer larger than one, and is not divisible by any positive integer other than itself and one.

Rikhail calls a number a palindromic if it is integer, positive, and its decimal representation without leading zeros is a palindrome, i.e. reads the same from left to right and right to left.

One problem with prime numbers is that there are too many of them. Let's introduce the following notation: π(*n*) — the number of primes no larger than *n*, *rub*(*n*) — the number of palindromic numbers no larger than *n*. Rikhail wants to prove that there are a lot more primes than palindromic ones.

The fly went along the coordinate plane to the center of the circle number  ( is the remainder after dividing number *x* by number *y*).

71,A,Way Too Long Words,PROGRAMMING,['strings'],"Sometimes some words like ""localization"" or ""internationalization"" are so long that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.

Let's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly more than 10 characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.

This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.

Thus, ""localization"" will be spelt as ""l10n"", and ""internationalization» will be spelt as ""i18n"".

You are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that all too long words should be replaced by the abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any changes.",The first line contains an integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100).

It is possible to reach each town from any other. Each road connects two towns $a$ and $b$. Kuro loves walking and he is planning to take a walking marathon, in which he will choose a pair of towns $(u, v)$ ($u \neq v$) and walk from $u$ using the shortest path to $v$ (note that $(u, v)$ is considered to be different from $(v, u)$).

Oddly, there are 2 special towns in Uberland named Flowrisa (denoted with the index $x$) and Beetopia (denoted with the index $y$). Flowrisa is a town where there are many strong-scent flowers, and Beetopia is another town where many bees live. In particular, Kuro will avoid any pair of towns $(u, v)$ if on the path from $u$ to $v$, he reaches Beetopia after he reached Flowrisa, since the bees will be attracted with the flower smell on Kuro’s body and sting him.

Kuro wants to know how many pair of city $(u, v)$ he can take as his route. Since he’s not really bright, he asked you to help him with this problem.","The first line contains three integers $n$, $x$ and $y$ ($1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \leq x, y \leq n$, $x \ne y$) - the number of towns, index of the town Flowrisa and index of the town Beetopia, respectively.

$n - 1$ lines follow, each line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \leq a, b \leq n$, $a \ne b$), describes a road connecting two towns $a$ and $b$.

It is guaranteed that from each town, we can reach every other town in the city using the given roads. That is, the given map of towns and roads is a tree.","A single integer resembles the number of pair of towns $(u, v)$ that Kuro can use as his walking route.","['3 1 3\n1 2\n2 3\n', '3 1 3\n1 2\n1 3\n']","['5', '4']","On the first example, Kuro can choose these pairs:

Kuro can't choose pair $(1, 3)$ since his walking route would be $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3$, in which Kuro visits town $1$ (Flowrisa) and then visits town $3$ (Beetopia), which is not allowed (note that pair $(3, 1)$ is still allowed because although Kuro visited Flowrisa and Beetopia, he did not visit them in that order).

On the second example, Kuro can choose the following pairs:

He has a huge number $s$. Polycarp wants to cut from it the maximum number of numbers that are divisible by $3$. To do this, he makes an arbitrary number of vertical cuts between pairs of adjacent digits. As a result, after $m$ such cuts, there will be $m+1$ parts in total. Polycarp analyzes each of the obtained numbers and finds the number of those that are divisible by $3$.

For example, if the original number is $s=3121$, then Polycarp can cut it into three parts with two cuts: $3|1|21$. As a result, he will get two numbers that are divisible by $3$.

Polycarp can make an arbitrary number of vertical cuts, where each cut is made between a pair of adjacent digits. The resulting numbers cannot contain extra leading zeroes (that is, the number can begin with 0 if and only if this number is exactly one character '0').

The rebuilding consists of performing several (perhaps zero) operations. An operation constitutes using a crane to take any tower and put it altogether on the top of some other neighboring tower. In other words, we can take the tower that stands *i*-th and put it on the top of either the (*i*<=-<=1)-th tower (if it exists), or the (*i*<=+<=1)-th tower (of it exists). The height of the resulting tower equals the sum of heights of the two towers that were put together.

227,B,Effective Approach,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.

According to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.

Vasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.

To finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.

But the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.","The first line contains integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105) — the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the elements of array. 

The third line contains integer *m* (1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=105) — the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=≤<=*b**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.","Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs. Separate the numbers by spaces.

In the second sample, on the contrary, Vasya's approach will need two comparisons (first with 1-st element, and then with the 2-nd), and Petya's approach will find the required value in one comparison (the first comparison with the 2-nd element).",TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED,"from sys import stdin

We will denote a cell of the field that is located in the *i*-th row and *j*-th column as (*i*,<=*j*).

You know that some squares of the given chess field are allowed. All allowed cells of the chess field are given as *n* segments.

Your task is to find the minimum number of moves the king needs to get from square (*x*0,<=*y*0) to square (*x*1,<=*y*1), provided that he only moves along the allowed cells. In other words, the king can be located only on allowed cells on his way.

The second line contains a single integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105), denoting the number of segments of allowed cells. Next *n* lines contain the descriptions of these segments.

191,A,Dynasty Puzzles,PROGRAMMING,['dp'],"The ancient Berlanders believed that the longer the name, the more important its bearer is. Thus, Berland kings were famous for their long names. But long names are somewhat inconvenient, so the Berlanders started to abbreviate the names of their kings. They called every king by the first letters of its name. Thus, the king, whose name was Victorious Vasily Pupkin, was always called by the berlanders VVP.

In Berland over its long history many dynasties of kings replaced each other, but they were all united by common traditions. Thus, according to one Berland traditions, to maintain stability in the country, the first name of the heir should be the same as the last name his predecessor (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the heir coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the predecessor). Berlanders appreciate stability, so this tradition has never been broken. Also Berlanders like perfection, so another tradition requires that the first name of the first king in the dynasty coincides with the last name of the last king in this dynasty (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the first king coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the last king). This tradition, of course, has also been always observed.

The name of a dynasty is formed by very simple rules: we take all the short names of the kings in the order in which they ruled, and write them in one line. Thus, a dynasty of kings ""ab"" and ""ba"" is called ""abba"", and the dynasty, which had only the king ""abca"", is called ""abca"".

Vasya, a historian, has recently found a list of abbreviated names of all Berland kings and their relatives. Help Vasya to find the maximally long name of the dynasty that could have existed in Berland.

1006,D,Two Strings Swaps,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"You are given two strings $a$ and $b$ consisting of lowercase English letters, both of length $n$. The characters of both strings have indices from $1$ to $n$, inclusive. 

You are allowed to do the following changes: 
 -  Choose any index $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) and swap characters $a_i$ and $b_i$; -  Choose any index $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) and swap characters $a_i$ and $a_{n - i + 1}$; -  Choose any index $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) and swap characters $b_i$ and $b_{n - i + 1}$. 
Note that if $n$ is odd, you are formally allowed to swap $a_{\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil}$ with $a_{\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil}$ (and the same with the string $b$) but this move is useless. Also you can swap two equal characters but this operation is useless as well.

You have to make these strings equal by applying any number of changes described above, in any order. But it is obvious that it may be impossible to make two strings equal by these swaps.

In one preprocess move you can replace a character in $a$ with another character. In other words, in a single preprocess move you can choose any index $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$), any character $c$ and set $a_i := c$.

Your task is to find the minimum number of preprocess moves to apply in such a way that after them you can make strings $a$ and $b$ equal by applying some number of changes described in the list above.

Note that the number of changes you make after the preprocess moves does not matter. Also note that you cannot apply preprocess moves to the string $b$ or make any preprocess moves after the first change is made.","The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) — the length of strings $a$ and $b$.

The second line contains the string $a$ consisting of exactly $n$ lowercase English letters.

The third line contains the string $b$ consisting of exactly $n$ lowercase English letters.","Print a single integer — the minimum number of preprocess moves to apply before changes, so that it is possible to make the string $a$ equal to string $b$ with a sequence of changes from the list above.","['7\nabacaba\nbacabaa\n', '5\nzcabd\ndbacz\n']","['4\n', '0\n']","In the first example preprocess moves are as follows: $a_1 := $'b', $a_3 := $'c', $a_4 := $'a' and $a_5:=$'b'. Afterwards, $a = $""bbcabba"". Then we can obtain equal strings by the following sequence of changes: $swap(a_2, b_2)$ and $swap(a_2, a_6)$. There is no way to use fewer than $4$ preprocess moves before a sequence of changes to make string equal, so the answer in this example is $4$.

In the second example no preprocess moves are required. We can use the following sequence of changes to make $a$ and $b$ equal: $swap(b_1, b_5)$, $swap(a_2, a_4)$.",WRONG_ANSWER,"import sys

Besides, the keys are of two types. Some of the keys have lowercase Latin letters on them and some of the keys work like the ""Shift"" key on standard keyboards, that is, they make lowercase letters uppercase.

Vasya can press one or two keys with one hand. However, he can only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the keys does not exceed *x*. The keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.

Vasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest ""Shift"" key is strictly larger than *x*.

The box's lock looks as follows: it contains 4 identical deepenings for gems as a 2<=×<=2 square, and some integer numbers are written at the lock's edge near the deepenings. The example of a lock is given on the picture below.

The box is accompanied with 9 gems. Their shapes match the deepenings' shapes and each gem contains one number from 1 to 9 (each number is written on exactly one gem). The box will only open after it is decorated with gems correctly: that is, each deepening in the lock should be filled with exactly one gem. Also, the sums of numbers in the square's rows, columns and two diagonals of the square should match the numbers written at the lock's edge. For example, the above lock will open if we fill the deepenings with gems with numbers as is shown on the picture below.

It is possible to reach each town from any other. Each road connects two towns $a$ and $b$. Kuro loves walking and he is planning to take a walking marathon, in which he will choose a pair of towns $(u, v)$ ($u \neq v$) and walk from $u$ using the shortest path to $v$ (note that $(u, v)$ is considered to be different from $(v, u)$).

Oddly, there are 2 special towns in Uberland named Flowrisa (denoted with the index $x$) and Beetopia (denoted with the index $y$). Flowrisa is a town where there are many strong-scent flowers, and Beetopia is another town where many bees live. In particular, Kuro will avoid any pair of towns $(u, v)$ if on the path from $u$ to $v$, he reaches Beetopia after he reached Flowrisa, since the bees will be attracted with the flower smell on Kuro’s body and sting him.

Kuro wants to know how many pair of city $(u, v)$ he can take as his route. Since he’s not really bright, he asked you to help him with this problem.","The first line contains three integers $n$, $x$ and $y$ ($1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \leq x, y \leq n$, $x \ne y$) - the number of towns, index of the town Flowrisa and index of the town Beetopia, respectively.

$n - 1$ lines follow, each line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \leq a, b \leq n$, $a \ne b$), describes a road connecting two towns $a$ and $b$.

It is guaranteed that from each town, we can reach every other town in the city using the given roads. That is, the given map of towns and roads is a tree.","A single integer resembles the number of pair of towns $(u, v)$ that Kuro can use as his walking route.","['3 1 3\n1 2\n2 3\n', '3 1 3\n1 2\n1 3\n']","['5', '4']","On the first example, Kuro can choose these pairs:

Kuro can't choose pair $(1, 3)$ since his walking route would be $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3$, in which Kuro visits town $1$ (Flowrisa) and then visits town $3$ (Beetopia), which is not allowed (note that pair $(3, 1)$ is still allowed because although Kuro visited Flowrisa and Beetopia, he did not visit them in that order).

On the second example, Kuro can choose the following pairs: 
 -  $(1, 2)$: his route would be $1 \rightarrow 2$, -  $(2, 1)$: his route would be $2 \rightarrow 1$, -  $(3, 2)$: his route would be $3 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2$, -  $(3, 1)$: his route would be $3 \rightarrow 1$.",TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED,"n,x,y=map(int,input().split(' '));x-=1;y-=1

The main character of this game has *n* different skills, each of which is characterized by an integer *a**i* from 0 to 100. The higher the number *a**i* is, the higher is the *i*-th skill of the character. The total rating of the character is calculated as the sum of the values ​​of  for all *i* from 1 to *n*. The expression ⌊ *x*⌋ denotes the result of rounding the number *x* down to the nearest integer.

At the beginning of the game Petya got *k* improvement units as a bonus that he can use to increase the skills of his character and his total rating. One improvement unit can increase any skill of Petya's character by exactly one. For example, if *a*4<==<=46, after using one imporvement unit to this skill, it becomes equal to 47. A hero's skill cannot rise higher more than 100. Thus, it is permissible that some of the units will remain unused.

Your task is to determine the optimal way of using the improvement units so as to maximize the overall rating of the character. It is not necessary to use all the improvement units.","The first line of the input contains two positive integers *n* and *k* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105, 0<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=107) — the number of skills of the character and the number of units of improvements at Petya's disposal.

The second line of the input contains a sequence of *n* integers *a**i* (0<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=100), where *a**i* characterizes the level of the *i*-th skill of the character.",The first line of the output should contain a single non-negative integer — the maximum total rating of the character that Petya can get using *k* or less improvement units.,"['2 4\n7 9\n', '3 8\n17 15 19\n', '2 2\n99 100\n']","['2\n', '5\n', '20\n']","In the first test case the optimal strategy is as follows. Petya has to improve the first skill to 10 by spending 3 improvement units, and the second skill to 10, by spending one improvement unit. Thus, Petya spends all his improvement units and the total rating of the character becomes equal to  *lfloor* *frac*{100}{10} *rfloor* +  *lfloor* *frac*{100}{10} *rfloor* = 10 + 10 =  20.

In the second test the optimal strategy for Petya is to improve the first skill to 20 (by spending 3 improvement units) and to improve the third skill to 20 (in this case by spending 1 improvement units). Thus, Petya is left with 4 improvement units and he will be able to increase the second skill to 19 (which does not change the overall rating, so Petya does not necessarily have to do it).

In the third test case the optimal strategy for Petya is to increase the first skill to 100 by spending 1 improvement unit.

Sergey gives Nastya the word *t* and wants to get the word *p* out of it. Nastya removes letters in a certain order (one after another, in this order strictly), which is specified by permutation of letters' indices of the word *t*: *a*1... *a*|*t*|. We denote the length of word *x* as |*x*|. Note that after removing one letter, the indices of other letters don't change. For example, if *t*<==<=""nastya"" and *a*<==<=[4,<=1,<=5,<=3,<=2,<=6] then removals make the following sequence of words ""nastya""  ""nastya""  ""nastya""  ""nastya""  ""nastya""  ""nastya""  ""nastya"".

Sergey knows this permutation. His goal is to stop his sister at some point and continue removing by himself to get the word *p*. Since Nastya likes this activity, Sergey wants to stop her as late as possible. Your task is to determine, how many letters Nastya can remove before she will be stopped by Sergey.

105,C,Item World,PROGRAMMING,"['brute force', 'implementation', 'sortings']","Each item in the game has a level. The higher the level is, the higher basic parameters the item has. We shall consider only the following basic parameters: attack (atk), defense (def) and resistance to different types of impact (res).

Each item belongs to one class. In this problem we will only consider three of such classes: weapon, armor, orb.

Besides, there's a whole new world hidden inside each item. We can increase an item's level travelling to its world. We can also capture the so-called residents in the Item World

Residents are the creatures that live inside items. Each resident gives some bonus to the item in which it is currently located. We will only consider residents of types: gladiator (who improves the item's atk), sentry (who improves def) and physician (who improves res).

Each item has the size parameter. The parameter limits the maximum number of residents that can live inside an item. We can move residents between items. Within one moment of time we can take some resident from an item and move it to some other item if it has a free place for a new resident. We cannot remove a resident from the items and leave outside — any of them should be inside of some item at any moment of time.

Laharl has a certain number of items. He wants to move the residents between items so as to equip himself with weapon, armor and a defensive orb. The weapon's atk should be largest possible in the end. Among all equipping patterns containing weapon's maximum atk parameter we should choose the ones where the armor’s def parameter is the largest possible. Among all such equipment patterns we should choose the one where the defensive orb would have the largest possible res parameter. Values of the parameters def and res of weapon, atk and res of armor and atk and def of orb are indifferent for Laharl.

Find the optimal equipment pattern Laharl can get.","The first line contains number *n* (3<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100) — representing how many items Laharl has.

Then follow *n* lines. Each line contains description of an item. The description has the following form: ""*name* *class* *atk* *def* *res* *size*"" — the item's name, class, basic attack, defense and resistance parameters and its size correspondingly. 
 -  *name* and *class* are strings and *atk*, *def*, *res* and *size* are integers. -  *name* consists of lowercase Latin letters and its length can range from 1 to 10, inclusive. -  *class* can be ""weapon"", ""armor"" or ""orb"". -  0<=≤<=*atk*,<=*def*,<=*res*<=≤<=1000. -  1<=≤<=*size*<=≤<=10. 
It is guaranteed that Laharl has at least one item of each class.

The next line contains an integer *k* (1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=1000) — the number of residents.

Then *k* lines follow. Each of them describes a resident. A resident description looks like: ""*name* *type* *bonus* *home*"" — the resident's name, his type, the number of points the resident adds to the item's corresponding parameter and the name of the item which currently contains the resident. 
 -  *name*, *type* and *home* are strings and *bonus* is an integer. -  *name* consists of lowercase Latin letters and its length can range from 1 to 10, inclusive. -  *type* may be ""gladiator"", ""sentry"" or ""physician"". -  1<=≤<=*bonus*<=≤<=100.

1009,E,Intercity Travelling,PROGRAMMING,"['combinatorics', 'math', 'probabilities']","Leha is planning his journey from Moscow to Saratov. He hates trains, so he has decided to get from one city to another by car.

The path from Moscow to Saratov can be represented as a straight line (well, it's not that straight in reality, but in this problem we will consider it to be straight), and the distance between Moscow and Saratov is $n$ km. Let's say that Moscow is situated at the point with coordinate $0$ km, and Saratov — at coordinate $n$ km.

Driving for a long time may be really difficult. Formally, if Leha has already covered $i$ kilometers since he stopped to have a rest, he considers the difficulty of covering $(i + 1)$-th kilometer as $a_{i + 1}$. It is guaranteed that for every $i \in [1, n - 1]$ $a_i \le a_{i + 1}$. The difficulty of the journey is denoted as the sum of difficulties of each kilometer in the journey.

Fortunately, there may be some rest sites between Moscow and Saratov. Every integer point from $1$ to $n - 1$ may contain a rest site. When Leha enters a rest site, he may have a rest, and the next kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the kilometer after it — difficulty $a_2$, and so on.

For example, if $n = 5$ and there is a rest site in coordinate $2$, the difficulty of journey will be $2a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3$: the first kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the second one — $a_2$, then Leha will have a rest, and the third kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the fourth — $a_2$, and the last one — $a_3$. Another example: if $n = 7$ and there are rest sites in coordinates $1$ and $5$, the difficulty of Leha's journey is $3a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3 + a_4$.

Leha doesn't know which integer points contain rest sites. So he has to consider every possible situation. Obviously, there are $2^{n - 1}$ different distributions of rest sites (two distributions are different if there exists some point $x$ such that it contains a rest site in exactly one of these distributions). Leha considers all these distributions to be equiprobable. He wants to calculate $p$ — the expected value of difficulty of his journey.

Obviously, $p \cdot 2^{n - 1}$ is an integer number. You have to calculate it modulo $998244353$.","The first line contains one number $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^6$) — the distance from Moscow to Saratov.

Two teams of company Q decided to battle each other. Let's enumerate players from both teams by integers from 1 to 4.

Before the game, the teams determine how they will play. First the players of the first team decide who will play in the attack, and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do the same, based on the choice of their opponents.

We will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.

1004,C,Sonya and Robots,PROGRAMMING,"['constructive algorithms', 'implementation']","Since Sonya is interested in robotics too, she decided to construct robots that will read and recognize numbers.

Sonya has drawn $n$ numbers in a row, $a_i$ is located in the $i$-th position. She also has put a robot at each end of the row (to the left of the first number and to the right of the last number). Sonya will give a number to each robot (they can be either same or different) and run them. When a robot is running, it is moving toward to another robot, reading numbers in the row. When a robot is reading a number that is equal to the number that was given to that robot, it will turn off and stay in the same position.

Sonya does not want robots to break, so she will give such numbers that robots will stop before they meet. That is, the girl wants them to stop at different positions so that the first robot is to the left of the second one.

For example, if the numbers $[1, 5, 4, 1, 3]$ are written, and Sonya gives the number $1$ to the first robot and the number $4$ to the second one, the first robot will stop in the $1$-st position while the second one in the $3$-rd position. In that case, robots will not meet each other. As a result, robots will not be broken. But if Sonya gives the number $4$ to the first robot and the number $5$ to the second one, they will meet since the first robot will stop in the $3$-rd position while the second one is in the $2$-nd position.

Sonya understands that it does not make sense to give a number that is not written in the row because a robot will not find this number and will meet the other robot.

Sonya is now interested in finding the number of different pairs that she can give to robots so that they will not meet. In other words, she wants to know the number of pairs ($p$, $q$), where she will give $p$ to the first robot and $q$ to the second one. Pairs ($p_i$, $q_i$) and ($p_j$, $q_j$) are different if $p_i\neq p_j$ or $q_i\neq q_j$.

Unfortunately, Sonya is busy fixing robots that broke after a failed launch. That is why she is asking you to find the number of pairs that she can give to robots so that they will not meet.","The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1\leq n\leq 10^5$) — the number of numbers in a row.

152,B,Steps,PROGRAMMING,"['binary search', 'implementation']","One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: ""How did he do that?"" The answer is simple.

Vasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=×<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=≤<=*x*<=≤<=*n*,<=1<=≤<=*y*<=≤<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.

Initially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).

A step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.

Vasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.","The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=109) — the yard's sizes. The second line contains integers *x**c* and *y**c* — the initial square's coordinates (1<=≤<=*x**c*<=≤<=*n*,<=1<=≤<=*y**c*<=≤<=*m*).

The third line contains an integer *k* (1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=104) — the number of vectors. Then follow *k* lines, each of them contains two integers *dx**i* and *dy**i* (|*dx**i*|,<=|*dy**i*|<=≤<=109,<=|*dx*|<=+<=|*dy*|<=≥<=1).","Print the single number — the number of steps Vasya had made.

For example, each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform and guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well. For each team the color of the home and guest uniform is different.

There are *n* teams taking part in the national championship. The championship consists of *n*·(*n*<=-<=1) games: each team invites each other team to its stadium. At this point Manao wondered: how many times during the championship is a host team going to put on the guest uniform? Note that the order of the games does not affect this number.

Every time he starts brooding he can no longer fully concentrate and repeatedly presses the keys that need to be pressed only once. For example, instead of the phrase ""how are you"" he can type ""hhoow aaaare yyoouu"". 

Polycarp decided to automate the process of correcting such errors. He decided to write a plug-in to the text editor that will remove pairs of identical consecutive letters (if there are any in the text). Of course, this is not exactly what Polycarp needs, but he's got to start from something! 

Help Polycarp and write the main plug-in module. Your program should remove from a string all pairs of identical letters, which are consecutive. If after the removal there appear new pairs, the program should remove them as well. Technically, its work should be equivalent to the following: while the string contains a pair of consecutive identical letters, the pair should be deleted. Note that deleting of the consecutive identical letters can be done in any order, as any order leads to the same result.",The input data consists of a single line to be processed.

The education is not easy because you need to have fundamental knowledge in different areas, which sometimes are not related to each other. 

For example, you should know linguistics very well. You learn a structure of Reberland language as foreign language. In this language words are constructed according to the following rules. First you need to choose the ""root"" of the word — some string which has more than 4 letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3 symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction —  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row. All these strings are considered to be suffixes of the word (this time we use word ""suffix"" to describe a morpheme but not the few last characters of the string as you may used to). 

Here is one exercise that you have found in your task list. You are given the word *s*. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language. 

Two strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match. 

Let's look at the example: the word *abacabaca* is given. This word can be obtained in the following ways: , where the root of the word is overlined, and suffixes are marked by ""corners"". Thus, the set of possible suffixes for this word is {*aca*,<=*ba*,<=*ca*}.",The only line contains a string *s* (5<=≤<=|*s*|<=≤<=104) consisting of lowercase English letters.,"On the first line print integer *k* — a number of distinct possible suffixes.

66,B,Petya and Countryside,PROGRAMMING,"['brute force', 'implementation']","Little Petya often travels to his grandmother in the countryside. The grandmother has a large garden, which can be represented as a rectangle 1<=×<=*n* in size, when viewed from above. This rectangle is divided into *n* equal square sections. The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.

Creating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section. At that, the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section. That is, for example, the garden can be represented by a 1<=×<=5 rectangle, where the section heights are equal to 4, 2, 3, 3, 2. Then if we create an artificial rain over any of the sections with the height of 3, the water will flow over all the sections, except the ones with the height of 4. See the illustration of this example at the picture:

As Petya is keen on programming, he decided to find such a section that if we create artificial rain above it, the number of watered sections will be maximal.

She said that at some time *n* snacks of distinct sizes will fall on the city, and the residents should build a Snacktower of them by placing snacks one on another. Of course, big snacks should be at the bottom of the tower, while small snacks should be at the top.

Years passed, and once different snacks started to fall onto the city, and the residents began to build the Snacktower.

However, they faced some troubles. Each day exactly one snack fell onto the city, but their order was strange. So, at some days the residents weren't able to put the new stack on the top of the Snacktower: they had to wait until all the bigger snacks fell. Of course, in order to not to anger miss Fortune again, the residents placed each snack on the top of the tower immediately as they could do it.

39,G,Inverse Function,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Petya wrote a programme on C++ that calculated a very interesting function *f*(*n*). Petya ran the program with a certain value of *n* and went to the kitchen to have some tea. The history has no records concerning how long the program had been working. By the time Petya returned, it had completed the calculations and had the result. However while Petya was drinking tea, a sly virus managed to destroy the input file so that Petya can't figure out for which value of *n* the program was run. Help Petya, carry out the inverse function!

Mostly, the program consists of a function in C++ with the following simplified syntax:
 -  *function* ::= int f(int n) {*operatorSequence*}-  *operatorSequence* ::= *operator* | *operator* *operatorSequence*-  *operator* ::= return *arithmExpr*; | if (*logicalExpr*) return *arithmExpr*;-  *logicalExpr* ::= *arithmExpr*<=&gt;<=*arithmExpr* | *arithmExpr*<=&lt;<=*arithmExpr* | *arithmExpr* == *arithmExpr*-  *arithmExpr* ::= *sum*-  *sum* ::= *product* | *sum*<=+<=*product* | *sum*<=-<=*product*-  *product* ::= *multiplier* | *product*<=*<=*multiplier* | *product*<=/<=*multiplier*-  *multiplier* ::= n | *number* | f(*arithmExpr*)-  *number* ::= 0|1|2|... |32767 
The whitespaces in a *operatorSequence* are optional.

Thus, we have a function, in which body there are two kinds of operators. There is the operator ""return *arithmExpr*;"" that returns the value of the expression as the value of the function, and there is the conditional operator ""if (*logicalExpr*) return *arithmExpr*;"" that returns the value of the arithmetical expression when and only when the logical expression is true. Guaranteed that no other constructions of C++ language — cycles, assignment operators, nested conditional operators etc, and other variables except the *n* parameter are used in the function. All the constants are integers in the interval [0..32767].

The operators are performed sequentially. After the function has returned a value other operators in the sequence are not performed. Arithmetical expressions are performed taking into consideration the standard priority of the operations. It means that first all the products that are part of the sum are calculated. During the calculation of the products the operations of multiplying and division are performed from the left to the right. Then the summands are summed, and the addition and the subtraction are also performed from the left to the right. Operations ""&gt;"" (more), ""&lt;"" (less) and ""=="" (equals) also have standard meanings.

Now you've got to pay close attention! The program is compiled with the help of 15-bit Berland C++ compiler invented by a Berland company BerSoft, that's why arithmetical operations are performed in a non-standard way. Addition, subtraction and multiplication are performed modulo 32768 (if the result of subtraction is negative, then 32768 is added to it until the number belongs to the interval [0..32767]). Division ""/"" is a usual integer division where the remainder is omitted.

Examples of arithmetical operations: 

Guaranteed that for all values of *n* from 0 to 32767 the given function is performed correctly. That means that:

1. Division by 0 never occures.

2. When performing a function for the value *n*<==<=*N* recursive calls of the function *f* may occur only for the parameter value of 0,<=1,<=...,<=*N*<=-<=1. Consequently, the program never has an infinite recursion.

3. As the result of the sequence of the operators, the function always returns a value.

We have to mention that due to all the limitations the value returned by the function *f* is independent from either global variables or the order of performing the calculations of arithmetical expressions as part of the logical one, or from anything else except the value of *n* parameter. That's why the *f* function can be regarded as a function in its mathematical sense, i.e. as a unique correspondence between any value of *n* from the interval [0..32767] and a value of *f*(*n*) from the same interval.

Given the value of *f*(*n*), and you should find *n*. If the suitable *n* value is not unique, you should find the maximal one (from the interval [0..32767]).","The first line has an integer *f*(*n*) from the interval [0..32767].

177,F1,Script Generation,PROGRAMMING,[],"The Smart Beaver from ABBYY was offered a job of a screenwriter for the ongoing TV series. In particular, he needs to automate the hard decision: which main characters will get married by the end of the series.

There are *n* single men and *n* single women among the main characters. An opinion poll showed that viewers like several couples, and a marriage of any of them will make the audience happy. The Smart Beaver formalized this fact as *k* triples of numbers (*h*,<=*w*,<=*r*), where *h* is the index of the man, *w* is the index of the woman, and *r* is the measure of the audience's delight in case of the marriage of this couple. The same poll showed that the marriage of any other couple will leave the audience indifferent, so the screenwriters decided not to include any such marriages in the plot.

The script allows you to arrange several marriages between the heroes or not to arrange marriages at all. A subset of some of the *k* marriages is considered acceptable if each man and each woman is involved in at most one marriage of the subset (the series won't allow any divorces). The value of the acceptable set of marriages is the total delight the spectators will get from the marriages included in this set.

Obviously, there is a finite number of acceptable sets, and they all describe some variants of the script. The screenwriters do not want to choose a set with maximum value — it would make the plot too predictable. So the Smart Beaver offers the following option: sort all the acceptable sets in increasing order of value and choose the *t*-th set from the sorted list. Thus, *t*<==<=1 corresponds to a plot without marriages, *t*<==<=2 — to a single marriage resulting in minimal delight for the audience, and so on.

Help the Beaver to implement the algorithm for selecting the desired set.","The first input line contains integers *n*, *k* and *t* (1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=*min*(100,<=*n*2), 1<=≤<=*t*<=≤<=2·105), separated by single spaces.

It is guaranteed that the input data is correct: *t* doesn't exceed the total number of acceptable sets, and each pair (*h*,<=*w*) is present in at most one triple.

455,C,Civilization,PROGRAMMING,"['dfs and similar', 'dp', 'dsu', 'ternary search', 'trees']","Andrew plays a game called ""Civilization"". Dima helps him.

The game has *n* cities and *m* bidirectional roads. The cities are numbered from 1 to *n*. Between any pair of cities there either is a single (unique) path, or there is no path at all. A path is such a sequence of distinct cities *v*1,<=*v*2,<=...,<=*v**k*, that there is a road between any contiguous cities *v**i* and *v**i*<=+<=1 (1<=≤<=*i*<=&lt;<=*k*). The length of the described path equals to (*k*<=-<=1). We assume that two cities lie in the same region if and only if, there is a path connecting these two cities.

During the game events of two types take place:
 1.  Andrew asks Dima about the length of the longest path in the region where city *x* lies. 1.  Andrew asks Dima to merge the region where city *x* lies with the region where city *y* lies. If the cities lie in the same region, then no merging is needed. Otherwise, you need to merge the regions as follows: choose a city from the first region, a city from the second region and connect them by a road so as to minimize the length of the longest path in the resulting region. If there are multiple ways to do so, you are allowed to choose any of them. 
Dima finds it hard to execute Andrew's queries, so he asks you to help him. Help Dima.","The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *q* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=3·105; 0<=≤<=*m*<=&lt;<=*n*; 1<=≤<=*q*<=≤<=3·105) — the number of cities, the number of the roads we already have and the number of queries, correspondingly.

Each of the following *m* lines contains two integers, *a**i* and *b**i* (*a**i*<=≠<=*b**i*; 1<=≤<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=≤<=*n*). These numbers represent the road between cities *a**i* and *b**i*. There can be at most one road between two cities.

Each of the following *q* lines contains one of the two events in the following format:
 -  1 *x**i*. It is the request Andrew gives to Dima to find the length of the maximum path in the region that contains city *x**i* (1<=≤<=*x**i*<=≤<=*n*).  2 *x**i* *y**i*. It is the request Andrew gives to Dima to merge the region that contains city *x**i* and the region that contains city *y**i* (1<=≤<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=≤<=*n*). Note, that *x**i* can be equal to *y**i*.

44,H,Phone Number,PROGRAMMING,['dp'],"Alas, finding one's true love is not easy. Masha has been unsuccessful in that yet. Her friend Dasha told Masha about a way to determine the phone number of one's Prince Charming through arithmancy. 

The phone number is divined like that. First one needs to write down one's own phone numbers. For example, let's suppose that Masha's phone number is 12345. After that one should write her favorite digit from 0 to 9 under the first digit of her number. That will be the first digit of the needed number. For example, Masha's favorite digit is 9. The second digit is determined as a half sum of the second digit of Masha's number and the already written down first digit from her beloved one's number. In this case the arithmetic average equals to (2<=+<=9)<=/<=2<==<=5.5. Masha can round the number up or down, depending on her wishes. For example, she chooses the digit 5. Having written down the resulting digit under the second digit of her number, Masha moves to finding the third digit in the same way, i.e. finding the half sum the the third digit of her number and the second digit of the new number. The result is (5<=+<=3)<=/<=2<==<=4. In this case the answer is unique. Thus, every *i*-th digit is determined as an arithmetic average of the *i*-th digit of Masha's number and the *i*<=-<=1-th digit of her true love's number. If needed, the digit can be rounded up or down. For example, Masha can get:",The first line contains nonempty sequence consisting of digits from 0 to 9 — Masha's phone number.

As the extreme archers (i.e. archers numbered 1 and *n*) are very far, the fire ball cannot reach them. Polycarp can hit any other archer with his fire ball.

Pari and Arya have won a great undirected graph as an award in a team contest. Now they have to split it in two parts, but both of them want their parts of the graph to be a vertex cover.

They have agreed to give you their graph and you need to find two disjoint subsets of its vertices *A* and *B*, such that both *A* and *B* are vertex cover or claim it's impossible.

Each of the next *m* lines contains a pair of integers *u**i* and *v**i* (1<=<=≤<=<=*u**i*,<=<=*v**i*<=<=≤<=<=*n*), denoting an undirected edge between *u**i* and *v**i*.

""But these blends are at their best, aren't they?"" Absorbed in the landscape, Kanno remains optimistic. 

The landscape can be expressed as a row of consecutive cells, each of which either contains a flower of colour amber or buff or canary yellow, or is empty.

When a flower withers, it disappears from the cell that it originally belonged to, and it spreads petals of its colour in its two neighbouring cells (or outside the field if the cell is on the side of the landscape). In case petals fall outside the given cells, they simply become invisible.

You are to help Kanno determine whether it's possible that after some (possibly none or all) flowers shed their petals, at least one of the cells contains all three colours, considering both petals and flowers. Note that flowers can wither in arbitrary order.","The first and only line of input contains a non-empty string $s$ consisting of uppercase English letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and characters '.' (dots) only ($\lvert s \rvert \leq 100$) — denoting cells containing an amber flower, a buff one, a canary yellow one, and no flowers, respectively.","Output ""Yes"" if it's possible that all three colours appear in some cell, and ""No"" otherwise.

1000,B,Light It Up,PROGRAMMING,['greedy'],"Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are ""lights on"" and ""lights off""). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.

The lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.

The lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.

Since you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.

Find such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.","First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$, $2 \le M \le 10^9$) — the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.

Second line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) — initially installed program $a$.",Print the only integer — maximum possible total time when the lamp is lit.,"['3 10\n4 6 7\n', '2 12\n1 10\n', '2 7\n3 4\n']","['8\n', '9\n', '6\n']","In the first example, one of possible optimal solutions is to insert value $x = 3$ before $a_1$, so program will be $[3, 4, 6, 7]$ and time of lamp being lit equals $(3 - 0) + (6 - 4) + (10 - 7) = 8$. Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.

In the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.

In the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$.",WRONG_ANSWER,"# template begins

The game goes as follows. Kids stand in circle. Let's agree to think of the children as numbered with numbers from 1 to *n* clockwise and the child number 1 is holding the ball. First the first child throws the ball to the next one clockwise, i.e. to the child number 2. Then the child number 2 throws the ball to the next but one child, i.e. to the child number 4, then the fourth child throws the ball to the child that stands two children away from him, i.e. to the child number 7, then the ball is thrown to the child who stands 3 children away from the child number 7, then the ball is thrown to the child who stands 4 children away from the last one, and so on. It should be mentioned that when a ball is thrown it may pass the beginning of the circle. For example, if *n*<==<=5, then after the third throw the child number 2 has the ball again. Overall, *n*<=-<=1 throws are made, and the game ends.

The problem is that not all the children get the ball during the game. If a child doesn't get the ball, he gets very upset and cries until Natalia Pavlovna gives him a candy.

If at the end of the game there is only one player with the maximum number of points, he is the winner. The situation becomes more difficult if the number of such players is more than one. During each round a player gains or loses a particular number of points. In the course of the game the number of points is registered in the line ""name score"", where name is a player's name, and score is the number of points gained in this round, which is an integer number. If score is negative, this means that the player has lost in the round. So, if two or more players have the maximum number of points (say, it equals to *m*) at the end of the game, than wins the one of them who scored at least *m* points first.

He ate his breakfast and sat in his car. Sadly, when he opened his GPS navigator, he found that some of the roads in Bankopolis, the city where he lives, are closed due to road works. Moreover, Igor has some problems with the steering wheel, so he can make no more than two turns on his way to his office in bank.

Bankopolis looks like a grid of *n* rows and *m* columns. Igor should find a way from his home to the bank that has no more than two turns and doesn't contain cells with road works, or determine that it is impossible and he should work from home. A turn is a change in movement direction. Igor's car can only move to the left, to the right, upwards and downwards. Initially Igor can choose any direction. Igor is still sleepy, so you should help him.","The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=1000) — the number of rows and the number of columns in the grid.

Now an exam on Mathematical Analysis is approaching and something has to be done asap (that is, quickly). Let's number the students of the group from 1 to *n*. Each student *i* (1<=≤<=*i*<=≤<=*n*) has a best friend *p*[*i*] (1<=≤<=*p*[*i*]<=≤<=*n*). In fact, each student is a best friend of exactly one student. In other words, all *p*[*i*] are different. It is possible that the group also has some really ""special individuals"" for who *i*<==<=*p*[*i*].

Each student wrote exactly one notebook of lecture notes. We know that the students agreed to act by the following algorithm: 
 -  on the first day of revising each student studies his own Mathematical Analysis notes, -  in the morning of each following day each student gives the notebook to his best friend and takes a notebook from the student who calls him the best friend. 
Thus, on the second day the student *p*[*i*] (1<=≤<=*i*<=≤<=*n*) studies the *i*-th student's notes, on the third day the notes go to student *p*[*p*[*i*]] and so on. Due to some characteristics of the boys' friendship (see paragraph 1), each day each student has exactly one notebook to study.

You are given two sequences that describe the situation on the third and fourth days of revising:
 -  *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*, where *a**i* means the student who gets the *i*-th student's notebook on the third day of revising; -  *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**n*, where *b**i* means the student who gets the *i*-th student's notebook on the fourth day of revising.

Most damage those strange creatures inflicted upon the kingdom was that they loved high precision numbers. As a result, the Kingdom healers had already had three appointments with the merchants who were asked to sell, say, exactly 0.273549107 beer barrels. To deal with the problem somehow, the King issued an order obliging rounding up all numbers to the closest integer to simplify calculations. Specifically, the order went like this:
-  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is strictly less than 0.5, then the rounded up number coincides with the number’s integer part. -  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is not less than 0.5, the rounded up number is obtained if we add 1 to the last digit of the number’s integer part.-  If the number’s integer part ends with digit 9, to round up the numbers one should go to Vasilisa the Wise. In the whole Kingdom she is the only one who can perform the tricky operation of carrying into the next position. 
Merchants found the algorithm very sophisticated and they asked you (the ACMers) to help them.

120,F,Spiders,PROGRAMMING,"['dp', 'greedy', 'trees']","One day mum asked Petya to sort his toys and get rid of some of them. Petya found a whole box of toy spiders. They were quite dear to him and the boy didn't want to throw them away. Petya conjured a cunning plan: he will glue all the spiders together and attach them to the ceiling. Besides, Petya knows that the lower the spiders will hang, the more mum is going to like it and then she won't throw his favourite toys away. Help Petya carry out the plan.

A spider consists of *k* beads tied together by *k*<=-<=1 threads. Each thread connects two different beads, at that any pair of beads that make up a spider is either directly connected by a thread, or is connected via some chain of threads and beads.

Petya may glue spiders together directly gluing their beads. The length of each thread equals 1. The sizes of the beads can be neglected. That's why we can consider that gluing spiders happens by identifying some of the beads (see the picture). Besides, the construction resulting from the gluing process should also represent a spider, that is, it should have the given features. 

After Petya glues all spiders together, he measures the length of the resulting toy. The distance between a pair of beads is identified as the total length of the threads that connect these two beads. The length of the resulting construction is the largest distance between all pairs of beads. Petya wants to make the spider whose length is as much as possible.

The picture two shows two spiders from the second sample. We can glue to the bead number 2 of the first spider the bead number 1 of the second spider. The threads in the spiders that form the sequence of threads of maximum lengths are highlighted on the picture.","The first input file line contains one integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100) — the number of spiders.

198,B,Jumping on Walls,PROGRAMMING,['shortest paths'],"Vasya plays a computer game with ninjas. At this stage Vasya's ninja should get out of a deep canyon.

The canyon consists of two vertical parallel walls, their height is *n* meters. Let's imagine that we split these walls into 1 meter-long areas and number them with positive integers from 1 to *n* from bottom to top. Some areas are safe and the ninja can climb them. Others are spiky and ninja can't be there. Let's call such areas dangerous.

Initially the ninja is on the lower area of the left wall. He can use each second to perform one of the following actions: 
 -  climb one area up; -  climb one area down; -  jump to the opposite wall. That gets the ninja to the area that is exactly *k* meters higher than the area he jumped from. More formally, if before the jump the ninja is located at area *x* of one wall, then after the jump he is located at area *x*<=+<=*k* of the other wall. 
If at some point of time the ninja tries to get to an area with a number larger than *n*, then we can assume that the ninja got out of the canyon.

The canyon gets flooded and each second the water level raises one meter. Initially the water level is at the lower border of the first area. Ninja cannot be on the area covered by water. We can assume that the ninja and the water ""move in turns"" — first the ninja performs some action, then the water raises for one meter, then the ninja performs one more action and so on.

The level is considered completed if the ninja manages to get out of the canyon.

After several failed attempts Vasya started to doubt whether it is possible to complete the level at all. Help him answer the question.","The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*k*<=≤<=105) — the height of the canyon and the height of ninja's jump, correspondingly.

The second line contains the description of the left wall — a string with the length of *n* characters. The *i*-th character represents the state of the *i*-th wall area: character ""X"" represents a dangerous area and character ""-"" represents a safe area.

The third line describes the right wall in the same format.

It is guaranteed that the first area of the left wall is not dangerous.","Print ""YES"" (without the quotes) if the ninja can get out from the canyon, otherwise, print ""NO"" (without the quotes).","['7 3\n---X--X\n-X--XX-\n', '6 2\n--X-X-\nX--XX-\n']","['YES\n', 'NO\n']","In the first sample the ninja should first jump to the right wall, then go one meter down along the right wall, then jump to the left wall.

Patrick believes that a message is fancy if any uppercase letter stands to the left of any lowercase one. In other words, this rule describes the strings where first go zero or more uppercase letters, and then — zero or more lowercase letters.

To make the message fancy, Patrick can erase some letter and add the same letter in the same place in the opposite case (that is, he can replace an uppercase letter with the lowercase one and vice versa).

Guests from all over the kingdom gather here to discuss new trends in the world of confectionery. Yet some of the things discussed here are not supposed to be disclosed to the general public: the information can cause discord in the kingdom of Sweetland in case it turns out to reach the wrong hands. So it's a necessity to not let any uninvited guests in.

There are 26 entrances in Jelly Castle, enumerated with uppercase English letters from A to Z. Because of security measures, each guest is known to be assigned an entrance he should enter the castle through. The door of each entrance is opened right before the first guest's arrival and closed right after the arrival of the last guest that should enter the castle through this entrance. No two guests can enter the castle simultaneously.

For an entrance to be protected from possible intrusion, a candy guard should be assigned to it. There are *k* such guards in the castle, so if there are more than *k* opened doors, one of them is going to be left unguarded! Notice that a guard can't leave his post until the door he is assigned to is closed.

Slastyona had a suspicion that there could be uninvited guests at the evening. She knows the order in which the invited guests entered the castle, and wants you to help her check whether there was a moment when more than *k* doors were opened.","Two integers are given in the first string: the number of guests *n* and the number of guards *k* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=106, 1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=26).

Your task is to split this array into three parts (some of which may be empty) in such a way that each element of the array belongs to exactly one of the three parts, and each of the parts forms a consecutive contiguous subsegment (possibly, empty) of the original array. 

Let the sum of elements of the first part be $sum_1$, the sum of elements of the second part be $sum_2$ and the sum of elements of the third part be $sum_3$. Among all possible ways to split the array you have to choose a way such that $sum_1 = sum_3$ and $sum_1$ is maximum possible.

More formally, if the first part of the array contains $a$ elements, the second part of the array contains $b$ elements and the third part contains $c$ elements, then:

$$sum_1 = \sum\limits_{1 \le i \le a}d_i,$$ $$sum_2 = \sum\limits_{a + 1 \le i \le a + b}d_i,$$ $$sum_3 = \sum\limits_{a + b + 1 \le i \le a + b + c}d_i.$$

Then he measured the length of its sides, and found that each of them is equal to an integer number of centimeters. There the properties of the hexagon ended and Gerald decided to draw on it.

He painted a few lines, parallel to the sides of the hexagon. The lines split the hexagon into regular triangles with sides of 1 centimeter. Now Gerald wonders how many triangles he has got. But there were so many of them that Gerald lost the track of his counting.

This string should also consist of lowercase English letters and have the length equal to the lengths of strings *s* and *t*. 

Let's help Vitaly solve this easy problem!","The first line contains string *s* (1<=≤<=|*s*|<=≤<=100), consisting of lowercase English letters. Here, |*s*| denotes the length of the string.

The second line contains string *t* (|*t*|<==<=|*s*|), consisting of lowercase English letters.

Patrick believes that a message is fancy if any uppercase letter stands to the left of any lowercase one. In other words, this rule describes the strings where first go zero or more uppercase letters, and then — zero or more lowercase letters.

To make the message fancy, Patrick can erase some letter and add the same letter in the same place in the opposite case (that is, he can replace an uppercase letter with the lowercase one and vice versa). Patrick got interested in the following question: what minimum number of actions do we need to make a message fancy? Changing a letter's case in the message counts as one action. Patrick cannot perform any other actions.",The only line of the input contains a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters.

The game is played on a tree having *n* nodes, numbered from 1 to *n*. Each node *i* has an initial value *init**i*, which is either 0 or 1. The root of the tree is node 1.

One can perform several (possibly, zero) operations on the tree during the game. The only available type of operation is to pick a node *x*. Right after someone has picked node *x*, the value of node *x* flips, the values of sons of *x* remain the same, the values of sons of sons of *x* flips, the values of sons of sons of sons of *x* remain the same and so on.

The goal of the game is to get each node *i* to have value *goal**i*, which can also be only 0 or 1. You need to reach the goal of the game by using minimum number of operations.","The first line contains an integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105).

71,A,Way Too Long Words,PROGRAMMING,['strings'],"Sometimes some words like ""localization"" or ""internationalization"" are so long that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.

Let's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly more than 10 characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.

This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.

Thus, ""localization"" will be spelt as ""l10n"", and ""internationalization» will be spelt as ""i18n"".

1006,E,Military Problem,PROGRAMMING,"['dfs and similar', 'graphs', 'trees']","In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.

There are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.

Officer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:
 -  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$; -  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. 
For example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.

The structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.

Formally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.

Berland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.

To process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.

Suppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ — one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.

Let's look at the following example:

If officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.

If officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.

If officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.

If officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.

To answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.

You should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.","The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.

The second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \dots, p_n$ ($1 \le p_i &lt; i$), where $p_i$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $i$. The commander has index $1$ and doesn't have any superiors.

The next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query is given as a pair ($u_i, k_i$) ($1 \le u_i, k_i \le n$), where $u_i$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $k_i$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence.","Print $q$ numbers, where the $i$-th number is the officer at the position $k_i$ in the list which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if it starts spreading from officer $u_i$. Print ""-1"" if the number of officers which receive the command is less than $k_i$.

Of course, big snacks should be at the bottom of the tower, while small snacks should be at the top.

Years passed, and once different snacks started to fall onto the city, and the residents began to build the Snacktower.

However, they faced some troubles. Each day exactly one snack fell onto the city, but their order was strange. So, at some days the residents weren't able to put the new stack on the top of the Snacktower: they had to wait until all the bigger snacks fell. Of course, in order to not to anger miss Fortune again, the residents placed each snack on the top of the tower immediately as they could do it.

While we still don't know why their movements are so sluggish, the problem of laggy thinking has been recently resolved. It turns out that the reason is not (as previously suspected) any kind of brain defect – it's the opposite! Independent researchers confirmed that the nervous system of a zombie is highly complicated – it consists of *n* brains (much like a cow has several stomachs). They are interconnected by brain connectors, which are veins capable of transmitting thoughts between brains. There are two important properties such a brain network should have to function properly: 
 1.  It should be possible to exchange thoughts between any two pairs of brains (perhaps indirectly, through other brains). 1.  There should be no redundant brain connectors, that is, removing any brain connector would make property 1 false. 
If both properties are satisfied, we say that the nervous system is valid. Unfortunately (?), if the system is not valid, the zombie stops thinking and becomes (even more) dead. Your task is to analyze a given nervous system of a zombie and find out whether it is valid.","The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=1000) denoting the number of brains (which are conveniently numbered from 1 to *n*) and the number of brain connectors in the nervous system, respectively.

At the station he told his parents about what he was doing, and wrote two sequences of the colours that he had seen before and after his sleep, respectively.

Peter's parents know that their son likes to fantasize. They give you the list of the flags' colours at the stations that the train passes sequentially on the way from A to B, and ask you to find out if Peter could see those sequences on the way from A to B, or from B to A. Remember, please, that Peter had two periods of wakefulness.

Peter's parents put lowercase Latin letters for colours. The same letter stands for the same colour, different letters — for different colours.","The input data contains three lines. The first line contains a non-empty string, whose length does not exceed 105, the string consists of lowercase Latin letters — the flags' colours at the stations on the way from A to B. On the way from B to A the train passes the same stations, but in reverse order. 

The second line contains the sequence, written by Peter during the first period of wakefulness. The third line contains the sequence, written during the second period of wakefulness. Both sequences are non-empty, consist of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of each does not exceed 100 letters. Each of the sequences is written in chronological order.","Output one of the four words without inverted commas:

To ensure a better life for the Mars citizens, their emperor decided to take tax from every tourist who visited the planet. Natasha is the inhabitant of Earth, therefore she had to pay the tax to enter the territory of Mars.

There are $n$ banknote denominations on Mars: the value of $i$-th banknote is $a_i$. Natasha has an infinite number of banknotes of each denomination.

Martians have $k$ fingers on their hands, so they use a number system with base $k$. In addition, the Martians consider the digit $d$ (in the number system with base $k$) divine. Thus, if the last digit in Natasha's tax amount written in the number system with the base $k$ is $d$, the Martians will be happy. Unfortunately, Natasha does not know the Martians' divine digit yet.

Determine for which values $d$ Natasha can make the Martians happy.

Natasha can use only her banknotes. Martians don't give her change.","The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 100\,000$, $2 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of denominations of banknotes and the base of the number system on Mars.

No other digits other than $0_8$ and $4_8$ can be obtained. Digits $0_8$ and $4_8$ could also be obtained in other ways.

Thus, ""localization"" will be spelt as ""l10n"", and ""internationalization» will be spelt as ""i18n"".

He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.

One day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.

In his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.

Shapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length ∞ (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.

Now you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.",There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number.

883,F,Lost in Transliteration,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"There are some ambiguities when one writes Berland names with the letters of the Latin alphabet.

For example, the Berland sound u can be written in the Latin alphabet as ""u"", and can be written as ""oo"". For this reason, two words ""ulyana"" and ""oolyana"" denote the same name.

The second ambiguity is about the Berland sound h: one can use both ""h"" and ""kh"" to write it. For example, the words ""mihail"" and ""mikhail"" denote the same name.

There are *n* users registered on the Polycarp's website. Each of them indicated a name represented by the Latin letters. How many distinct names are there among them, if two ambiguities described above are taken into account?

Formally, we assume that two words denote the same name, if using the replacements ""u""  ""oo"" and ""h""  ""kh"", you can make the words equal. One can make replacements in both directions, in any of the two words an arbitrary number of times. A letter that resulted from the previous replacement can participate in the next replacements.

For example, the following pairs of words denote the same name:
 -  ""koouper"" and ""kuooper"". Making the replacements described above, you can make both words to be equal: ""koouper""  ""kuuper"" and ""kuooper""  ""kuuper"". -  ""khun"" and ""kkkhoon"". With the replacements described above you can make both words to be equal: ""khun""  ""khoon"" and ""kkkhoon""  ""kkhoon""  ""khoon"".

980,C,Posterized,PROGRAMMING,"['games', 'greedy']","Professor Ibrahim has prepared the final homework for his algorithm’s class. He asked his students to implement the Posterization Image Filter.

Their algorithm will be tested on an array of integers, where the $i$-th integer represents the color of the $i$-th pixel in the image. The image is in black and white, therefore the color of each pixel will be an integer between 0 and 255 (inclusive).

To implement the filter, students are required to divide the black and white color range [0, 255] into groups of consecutive colors, and select one color in each group to be the group’s key. In order to preserve image details, the size of a group must not be greater than $k$, and each color should belong to exactly one group.

Finally, the students will replace the color of each pixel in the array with that color’s assigned group key.

To better understand the effect, here is an image of a basking turtle where the Posterization Filter was applied with increasing $k$ to the right. 

To make the process of checking the final answer easier, Professor Ibrahim wants students to divide the groups and assign the keys in a way that produces the lexicographically smallest possible array.","The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^5$, $1 \leq k \leq 256$), the number of pixels in the image, and the maximum size of a group, respectively.

Let us remind you the rules of moving chess pieces. A chessboard is 64 square fields organized into an 8<=×<=8 table. A field is represented by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*) — the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:
 -  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically. -  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally. -  A king moves one field in any direction — horizontally, vertically or diagonally. 
Petya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2)? At that, we assume that there are no more pieces besides this one on the board. Help him solve this problem.","The input contains four integers *r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2 (1<=≤<=*r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2<=≤<=8) — the coordinates of the starting and the final field. The starting field doesn't coincide with the final one.

You can assume that the chessboard rows are numbered from top to bottom 1 through 8, and the columns are numbered from left to right 1 through 8.","Print three space-separated integers: the minimum number of moves the rook, the bishop and the king (in this order) is needed to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2).

Dima put the chessboard in front of Inna and placed the candy in position (*i*,<=*j*) on the board. The boy said he would give the candy if it reaches one of the corner cells of the board. He's got one more condition. There can only be actions of the following types:
 -  move the candy from position (*x*,<=*y*) on the board to position (*x*<=-<=*a*,<=*y*<=-<=*b*); -  move the candy from position (*x*,<=*y*) on the board to position (*x*<=+<=*a*,<=*y*<=-<=*b*); -  move the candy from position (*x*,<=*y*) on the board to position (*x*<=-<=*a*,<=*y*<=+<=*b*); -  move the candy from position (*x*,<=*y*) on the board to position (*x*<=+<=*a*,<=*y*<=+<=*b*). 
Naturally, Dima doesn't allow to move the candy beyond the chessboard borders.

Inna and the pony started shifting the candy around the board. They wonder what is the minimum number of allowed actions that they need to perform to move the candy from the initial position (*i*,<=*j*) to one of the chessboard corners. Help them cope with the task!","The first line of the input contains six integers *n*,<=*m*,<=*i*,<=*j*,<=*a*,<=*b* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=106; 1<=≤<=*i*<=≤<=*n*; 1<=≤<=*j*<=≤<=*m*; 1<=≤<=*a*,<=*b*<=≤<=106).

You can assume that the chessboard rows are numbered from 1 to *n* from top to bottom and the columns are numbered from 1 to *m* from left to right. Position (*i*,<=*j*) in the statement is a chessboard cell on the intersection of the *i*-th row and the *j*-th column. You can consider that the corners are: (1,<=*m*), (*n*,<=1), (*n*,<=*m*), (1,<=1).","In a single line print a single integer — the minimum number of moves needed to get the candy.

633,C,Spy Syndrome 2,PROGRAMMING,"['data structures', 'dp', 'hashing', 'implementation', 'sortings', 'string suffix structures', 'strings']","After observing the results of Spy Syndrome, Yash realised the errors of his ways. He now believes that a super spy such as Siddhant can't use a cipher as basic and ancient as Caesar cipher. After many weeks of observation of Siddhant’s sentences, Yash determined a new cipher technique.

For a given sentence, the cipher is processed as: 
 1.  Convert all letters of the sentence to lowercase. 1.  Reverse each of the words of the sentence individually. 1.  Remove all the spaces in the sentence. 
For example, when this cipher is applied to the sentence

Kira is childish and he hates losing

the resulting string is

ariksihsidlihcdnaehsetahgnisol

Now Yash is given some ciphered string and a list of words. Help him to find out any original sentence composed using only words from the list. Note, that any of the given words could be used in the sentence multiple times.","The first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=10<=000) — the length of the ciphered text. The second line consists of *n* lowercase English letters — the ciphered text *t*.

The third line contains a single integer *m* (1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=100<=000) — the number of words which will be considered while deciphering the text. Each of the next *m* lines contains a non-empty word *w**i* (|*w**i*|<=≤<=1<=000) consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters only. It's guaranteed that the total length of all words doesn't exceed 1<=000<=000.","Print one line — the original sentence. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.

In the first case both of them know the shared number is $1$, in the second case both of them know the shared number is $4$. You don't have enough information to tell $1$ and $4$ apart.

In the third case if the first participant was given $(1,2)$, they don't know what the shared number is, since from their perspective the second participant might have been given either $(1,3)$, in which case the shared number is $1$, or $(2,3)$, in which case the shared number is $2$.

182,B,Vasya's Calendar,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Vasya lives in a strange world. The year has *n* months and the *i*-th month has *a**i* days. Vasya got a New Year present — the clock that shows not only the time, but also the date.

The clock's face can display any number from 1 to *d*. It is guaranteed that *a**i*<=≤<=*d* for all *i* from 1 to *n*. The clock does not keep information about the current month, so when a new day comes, it simply increases the current day number by one. The clock cannot display number *d*<=+<=1, so after day number *d* it shows day 1 (the current day counter resets). The mechanism of the clock allows you to increase the day number by one manually. When you execute this operation, day *d* is also followed by day 1.

Vasya begins each day checking the day number on the clock. If the day number on the clock does not match the actual day number in the current month, then Vasya manually increases it by one. Vasya is persistent and repeats this operation until the day number on the clock matches the actual number of the current day in the current month.

In addition, it was decided that a road between the states should be built to guarantee so that one could any point of any country can be reached from any point of any other State.

Since roads are always expensive, the governments of the states of the newly formed alliance asked you to help them assess the costs. To do this, you have been issued a map that can be represented as a rectangle table consisting of *n* rows and *m* columns. Any cell of the map either belongs to one of three states, or is an area where it is allowed to build a road, or is an area where the construction of the road is not allowed. A cell is called passable, if it belongs to one of the states, or the road was built in this cell. From any passable cells you can move up, down, right and left, if the cell that corresponds to the movement exists and is passable.

Your task is to construct a road inside a minimum number of cells, so that it would be possible to get from any cell of any state to any cell of any other state using only passable cells.

It is guaranteed that initially it is possible to reach any cell of any state from any cell of this state, moving only along its cells.

For this purpose the corporation has consecutively hired *m* designers.

This results in the new version. It is possible that some of these letters do no occur in the string. It may also happen that *x**i* coincides with *y**i*. The version of the name received after the work of the last designer becomes the new name of the corporation.

Manager Arkady has recently got a job in this company, but is already soaked in the spirit of teamwork and is very worried about the success of the rebranding. Naturally, he can't wait to find out what is the new name the Corporation will receive.

If there are multiple such cities, then the Little Elephant won't go anywhere.

Let's denote *s* as the total number of cells of table *a*, that is, . We know that each cell of the table contains a single integer from 1 to *s*, at that all written integers are distinct. 

Let's assume that the cells of the *i*-th row of table *a* are numbered from 1 to *c**i*, then let's denote the number written in the *j*-th cell of the *i*-th row as *a**i*,<=*j*. Your task is to perform several swap operations to rearrange the numbers in the table so as to fulfill the following conditions:
 1.  for all *i*,<=*j* (1<=&lt;<=*i*<=≤<=*n*; 1<=≤<=*j*<=≤<=*c**i*) holds *a**i*,<=*j*<=&gt;<=*a**i*<=-<=1,<=*j*; 1.  for all *i*,<=*j* (1<=≤<=*i*<=≤<=*n*; 1<=&lt;<=*j*<=≤<=*c**i*) holds *a**i*,<=*j*<=&gt;<=*a**i*,<=*j*<=-<=1. 
In one swap operation you are allowed to choose two different cells of the table and swap the recorded there numbers, that is the number that was recorded in the first of the selected cells before the swap, is written in the second cell after it. Similarly, the number that was recorded in the second of the selected cells, is written in the first cell after the swap.

Rearrange the numbers in the required manner. Note that you are allowed to perform any number of operations, but not more than *s*. You do not have to minimize the number of operations.","The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=50) that shows the number of rows in the table. The second line contains *n* space-separated integers *c**i* (1<=≤<=*c**i*<=≤<=50; *c**i*<=≤<=*c**i*<=-<=1) — the numbers of cells on the corresponding rows.

Next *n* lines contain table *а*. The *i*-th of them contains *c**i* space-separated integers: the *j*-th integer in this line represents *a**i*,<=*j*.

It is guaranteed that all the given numbers *a**i*,<=*j* are positive and do not exceed *s*. It is guaranteed that all *a**i*,<=*j* are distinct.","In the first line print a single integer *m* (0<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=*s*), representing the number of performed swaps.

This game takes some number of turns to complete. On a turn, Hongcow may do one of two things: 
 -  Collect tokens. Hongcow collects 1 red token and 1 blue token by choosing this option (thus, 2 tokens in total per one operation). -  Buy a card. Hongcow chooses some card and spends tokens to purchase it as specified below. 
The *i*-th card requires *r**i* red resources and *b**i* blue resources. Suppose Hongcow currently has *A* red cards and *B* blue cards. Then, the *i*-th card will require Hongcow to spend *max*(*r**i*<=-<=*A*,<=0) red tokens, and *max*(*b**i*<=-<=*B*,<=0) blue tokens.

Sometimes they receive parcels from Uncle Fyodor’s parents and sometimes from anonymous benefactors, in which case it is hard to determine to which one of them the package has been sent. A photographic rifle is obviously for Sharic who loves hunting and fish is for Matroskin, but for whom was a new video game console meant? Every one of the three friends claimed that the present is for him and nearly quarreled. Uncle Fyodor had an idea how to solve the problem justly: they should suppose that the console was sent to all three of them and play it in turns. Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up — who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that’s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player wins. Otherwise, another game round is required. Write a program that will determine the winner by the gestures they have shown.","The first input line contains the name of the gesture that Uncle Fyodor showed, the second line shows which gesture Matroskin showed and the third line shows Sharic’s gesture.","Print ""F"" (without quotes) if Uncle Fyodor wins.

He left a calculator on the floor and went to ask some money from his parents. Meanwhile his little brother Yusuf came and started to press the keys randomly. Unfortunately Max has forgotten the number which he had calculated. The only thing he knows is that the number is divisible by 4.

You are given a string *s* consisting of digits (the number on the display of the calculator after Yusuf randomly pressed the keys). Your task is to find the number of substrings which are divisible by 4. A substring can start with a zero.

A substring of a string is a nonempty sequence of consecutive characters.

For example if string *s* is 124 then we have four substrings that are divisible by 4: 12, 4, 24 and 124. For the string 04 the answer is three: 0, 4, 04.

As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use gets/scanf/printf instead of getline/cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java.",The only line contains string *s* (1<=≤<=|*s*|<=≤<=3·105). The string *s* contains only digits from 0 to 9.,"Print integer *a* — the number of substrings of the string *s* that are divisible by 4.

Note that the answer can be huge, so you should use 64-bit integer type to store it. In C++ you can use the long long integer type and in Java you can use long integer type.","['124\n', '04\n', '5810438174\n']","['4\n', '3\n', '9\n']",none,OK,"import sys

Sergey gives Nastya the word *t* and wants to get the word *p* out of it. Nastya removes letters in a certain order (one after another, in this order strictly), which is specified by permutation of letters' indices of the word *t*: *a*1... *a*|*t*|. We denote the length of word *x* as |*x*|. Note that after removing one letter, the indices of other letters don't change. For example, if *t*<==<=""nastya"" and *a*<==<=[4,<=1,<=5,<=3,<=2,<=6] then removals make the following sequence of words ""nastya""  ""nastya""  ""nastya""  ""nastya""  ""nastya""  ""nastya""  ""nastya"".

Sergey knows this permutation. His goal is to stop his sister at some point and continue removing by himself to get the word *p*. Since Nastya likes this activity, Sergey wants to stop her as late as possible. Your task is to determine, how many letters Nastya can remove before she will be stopped by Sergey.

A fixed point for a permutation is an element *a**k* which has value equal to *k* (*a**k*<==<=*k*). Your job is to proof to Iahub that trying to recover it is not a good idea.

227,B,Effective Approach,PROGRAMMING,['implementation'],"Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.

According to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.

Vasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.

To finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.

But the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.","The first line contains integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105) — the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=*n*) — the elements of array.

It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.

Now let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.

As you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. ""But why split the money equally?"" — you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.","The first line contains integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100) — the number of coins.

To restore order, Anna and Maria do the following. First, for each student Anna finds out what other students he is tied to. If a student is tied to exactly one other student, Anna reprimands him. Then Maria gathers in a single group all the students who have been just reprimanded. She kicks them out from the club. This group of students immediately leaves the club. These students takes with them the laces that used to tie them. Then again for every student Anna finds out how many other students he is tied to and so on.

At a specific point in time, a spinner can take 4 positions shown below (each one rotated 90 degrees relative to the previous, with the fourth one followed by the first one):

After the spinner was spun, it starts its rotation, which is described by a following algorithm: the spinner maintains its position for a second then majestically switches to the next position in clockwise or counter-clockwise order, depending on the direction the spinner was spun in.

Slastyona managed to have spinner rotating for exactly *n* seconds. Being fascinated by elegance of the process, she completely forgot the direction the spinner was spun in! Lucky for her, she managed to recall the starting position, and wants to deduct the direction given the information she knows. Help her do this.","There are two characters in the first string – the starting and the ending position of a spinner. The position is encoded with one of the following characters: v (ASCII code 118, lowercase v), &lt; (ASCII code 60), ^ (ASCII code 94) or &gt; (ASCII code 62) (see the picture above for reference). Characters are separated by a single space.

In the second strings, a single number *n* is given (0<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=109) – the duration of the rotation.

The round was 120 minutes long and featured five problems with maximum point values of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500, respectively. Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.

Codeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is *x*, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute *m* but made *w* wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is . His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.

All arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.","The first line of the input contains five space-separated integers *m*1, *m*2, *m*3, *m*4, *m*5, where *m**i* (0<=≤<=*m**i*<=≤<=119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem *i*. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted.

The second line contains five space-separated integers *w*1, *w*2, *w*3, *w*4, *w*5, where *w**i* (0<=≤<=*w**i*<=≤<=10) is Kevin's number of wrong submissions on problem *i*.

The game is played as follows. In each level, you have a grid with *n* rows and *m* columns. Each cell originally contains the number 0.

One move consists of choosing one row or column, and adding 1 to all of the cells in that row or column.

To win the level, after all the moves, the number in the cell at the *i*-th row and *j*-th column should be equal to *g**i*,<=*j*.

Karen is stuck on one level, and wants to know a way to beat this level using the minimum number of moves. Please, help her with this task!","The first line of input contains two integers, *n* and *m* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*m*<=≤<=100), the number of rows and the number of columns in the grid, respectively.

The next *n* lines each contain *m* integers. In particular, the *j*-th integer in the *i*-th of these rows contains *g**i*,<=*j* (0<=≤<=*g**i*,<=*j*<=≤<=500).","If there is an error and it is actually not possible to beat the level, output a single integer -1.

Otherwise, on the first line, output a single integer *k*, the minimum number of moves necessary to beat the level.

The next *k* lines should each contain one of the following, describing the moves in the order they must be done:
 -  row *x*, (1<=≤<=*x*<=≤<=*n*) describing a move of the form ""choose the *x*-th row"". -  col *x*, (1<=≤<=*x*<=≤<=*m*) describing a move of the form ""choose the *x*-th column"".

The landscape can be expressed as a row of consecutive cells, each of which either contains a flower of colour amber or buff or canary yellow, or is empty.

When a flower withers, it disappears from the cell that it originally belonged to, and it spreads petals of its colour in its two neighbouring cells (or outside the field if the cell is on the side of the landscape). In case petals fall outside the given cells, they simply become invisible.

You are to help Kanno determine whether it's possible that after some (possibly none or all) flowers shed their petals, at least one of the cells contains all three colours, considering both petals and flowers. Note that flowers can wither in arbitrary order.","The first and only line of input contains a non-empty string $s$ consisting of uppercase English letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and characters '.'

The leaf vertices of the park contain restaurants. Kefa wants to choose a restaurant where he will go, but unfortunately he is very afraid of cats, so there is no way he will go to the restaurant if the path from the restaurant to his house contains more than *m* consecutive vertices with cats.

The second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*, where each *a**i* either equals to 0 (then vertex *i* has no cat), or equals to 1 (then vertex *i* has a cat).

At that the resulting line can intersect with itself and partially repeat itself but Scrooge pays no attention to it and never changes his signing style.

653,B,Bear and Compressing,PROGRAMMING,"['brute force', 'dfs and similar', 'dp', 'strings']","Limak is a little polar bear. Polar bears hate long strings and thus they like to compress them. You should also know that Limak is so young that he knows only first six letters of the English alphabet: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' and 'f'.

You are given a set of *q* possible operations. Limak can perform them in any order, any operation may be applied any number of times. The *i*-th operation is described by a string *a**i* of length two and a string *b**i* of length one. No two of *q* possible operations have the same string *a**i*.

When Limak has a string *s* he can perform the *i*-th operation on *s* if the first two letters of *s* match a two-letter string *a**i*. Performing the *i*-th operation removes first two letters of *s* and inserts there a string *b**i*. See the notes section for further clarification.

You may note that performing an operation decreases the length of a string *s* exactly by 1. Also, for some sets of operations there may be a string that cannot be compressed any further, because the first two letters don't match any *a**i*.

Limak wants to start with a string of length *n* and perform *n*<=-<=1 operations to finally get a one-letter string ""a"". In how many ways can he choose the starting string to be able to get ""a""? Remember that Limak can use only letters he knows.","The first line contains two integers *n* and *q* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=6, 1<=≤<=*q*<=≤<=36) — the length of the initial string and the number of available operations.

The disk has *m* recorded files, the *i*-th file occupies clusters with numbers *a**i*,<=1, *a**i*,<=2, ..., *a**i*,<=*n**i*. These clusters are not necessarily located consecutively on the disk, but the order in which they are given corresponds to their sequence in the file (cluster *a**i*,<=1 contains the first fragment of the *i*-th file, cluster *a**i*,<=2 has the second fragment, etc.). Also the disc must have one or several clusters which are free from files.

You are permitted to perform operations of copying the contents of cluster number *i* to cluster number *j* (*i* and *j* must be different). Moreover, if the cluster number *j* used to keep some information, it is lost forever. Clusters are not cleaned, but after the defragmentation is complete, some of them are simply declared unusable (although they may possibly still contain some fragments of files).

Your task is to use a sequence of copy operations to ensure that each file occupies a contiguous area of memory. Each file should occupy a consecutive cluster section, the files must follow one after another from the beginning of the hard disk. After defragmentation all free (unused) clusters should be at the end of the hard disk. After defragmenting files can be placed in an arbitrary order. Clusters of each file should go consecutively from first to last. See explanatory examples in the notes.

896,A,Nephren gives a riddle,PROGRAMMING,"['binary search', 'dfs and similar']","

Nephren is playing a game with little leprechauns.

She gives them an infinite array of strings, *f*0... ∞.

*f*0 is ""What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?"".

She wants to let more people know about it, so she defines *f**i*<==<= ""What are you doing while sending ""*f**i*<=-<=1""? Are you busy? Will you send ""*f**i*<=-<=1""?"" for all *i*<=≥<=1.

For example, *f*1 is

""What are you doing while sending ""What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?""? Are you busy? Will you send ""What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?""?"". Note that the quotes in the very beginning and in the very end are for clarity and are not a part of *f*1.

It can be seen that the characters in *f**i* are letters, question marks, (possibly) quotation marks and spaces.

Nephren will ask the little leprechauns *q* times. Each time she will let them find the *k*-th character of *f**n*. The characters are indexed starting from 1. If *f**n* consists of less than *k* characters, output '.' (without quotes).

Can you answer her queries?","The first line contains one integer *q* (1<=≤<=*q*<=≤<=10) — the number of Nephren's questions.

979,C,Kuro and Walking Route,PROGRAMMING,"['dfs and similar', 'trees']","Kuro is living in a country called Uberland, consisting of $n$ towns, numbered from $1$ to $n$, and $n - 1$ bidirectional roads connecting these towns. It is possible to reach each town from any other. Each road connects two towns $a$ and $b$. Kuro loves walking and he is planning to take a walking marathon, in which he will choose a pair of towns $(u, v)$ ($u \neq v$) and walk from $u$ using the shortest path to $v$ (note that $(u, v)$ is considered to be different from $(v, u)$).

Oddly, there are 2 special towns in Uberland named Flowrisa (denoted with the index $x$) and Beetopia (denoted with the index $y$). Flowrisa is a town where there are many strong-scent flowers, and Beetopia is another town where many bees live. In particular, Kuro will avoid any pair of towns $(u, v)$ if on the path from $u$ to $v$, he reaches Beetopia after he reached Flowrisa, since the bees will be attracted with the flower smell on Kuro’s body and sting him.

Kuro wants to know how many pair of city $(u, v)$ he can take as his route. Since he’s not really bright, he asked you to help him with this problem.","The first line contains three integers $n$, $x$ and $y$ ($1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \leq x, y \leq n$, $x \ne y$) - the number of towns, index of the town Flowrisa and index of the town Beetopia, respectively.

$n - 1$ lines follow, each line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \leq a, b \leq n$, $a \ne b$), describes a road connecting two towns $a$ and $b$.

It is guaranteed that from each town, we can reach every other town in the city using the given roads. That is, the given map of towns and roads is a tree.","A single integer resembles the number of pair of towns $(u, v)$ that Kuro can use as his walking route.","['3 1 3\n1 2\n2 3\n', '3 1 3\n1 2\n1 3\n']","['5', '4']","On the first example, Kuro can choose these pairs:

Kuro can't choose pair $(1, 3)$ since his walking route would be $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3$, in which Kuro visits town $1$ (Flowrisa) and then visits town $3$ (Beetopia), which is not allowed (note that pair $(3, 1)$ is still allowed because although Kuro visited Flowrisa and Beetopia, he did not visit them in that order).

On the second example, Kuro can choose the following pairs:

If connection ping (delay) is *t* milliseconds, the competition passes for a participant as follows:

Wanting to join the craze, she has immediately bought the strange contraption.

Spinners in Sweetland have the form of V-shaped pieces of caramel. Each spinner can, well, spin around an invisible magic axis. At a specific point in time, a spinner can take 4 positions shown below (each one rotated 90 degrees relative to the previous, with the fourth one followed by the first one):

After the spinner was spun, it starts its rotation, which is described by a following algorithm: the spinner maintains its position for a second then majestically switches to the next position in clockwise or counter-clockwise order, depending on the direction the spinner was spun in.

Slastyona managed to have spinner rotating for exactly *n* seconds. Being fascinated by elegance of the process, she completely forgot the direction the spinner was spun in! Lucky for her, she managed to recall the starting position, and wants to deduct the direction given the information she knows. Help her do this.","There are two characters in the first string – the starting and the ending position of a spinner. The position is encoded with one of the following characters: v (ASCII code 118, lowercase v), &lt; (ASCII code 60), ^ (ASCII code 94) or &gt; (ASCII code 62) (see the picture above for reference). Characters are separated by a single space.

In the second strings, a single number *n* is given (0<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=109) – the duration of the rotation.

704,B,Ant Man,PROGRAMMING,"['dp', 'graphs', 'greedy']","Scott Lang is at war with Darren Cross. There are *n* chairs in a hall where they are, numbered with 1,<=2,<=...,<=*n* from left to right. The *i*-th chair is located at coordinate *x**i*. Scott is on chair number *s* and Cross is on chair number *e*. Scott can jump to all other chairs (not only neighboring chairs). He wants to start at his position (chair number *s*), visit each chair exactly once and end up on chair number *e* with Cross. 

As we all know, Scott can shrink or grow big (grow big only to his normal size), so at any moment of time he can be either small or large (normal). The thing is, he can only shrink or grow big while being on a chair (not in the air while jumping to another chair). Jumping takes time, but shrinking and growing big takes no time. Jumping from chair number *i* to chair number *j* takes |*x**i*<=-<=*x**j*| seconds. Also, jumping off a chair and landing on a chair takes extra amount of time. 

If Scott wants to jump to a chair on his left, he can only be small, and if he wants to jump to a chair on his right he should be large.

Jumping off the *i*-th chair takes:
 -  *c**i* extra seconds if he's small. -  *d**i* extra seconds otherwise (he's large). 
Also, landing on *i*-th chair takes:
 -  *b**i* extra seconds if he's small. -  *a**i* extra seconds otherwise (he's large). 
In simpler words, jumping from *i*-th chair to *j*-th chair takes exactly:
 -  |*x**i*<=-<=*x**j*|<=+<=*c**i*<=+<=*b**j* seconds if *j*<=&lt;<=*i*. -  |*x**i*<=-<=*x**j*|<=+<=*d**i*<=+<=*a**j* seconds otherwise (*j*<=&gt;<=*i*). 
Given values of *x*, *a*, *b*, *c*, *d* find the minimum time Scott can get to Cross, assuming he wants to visit each chair exactly once.","The first line of the input contains three integers *n*,<=*s* and *e* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=5000,<=1<=≤<=*s*,<=*e*<=≤<=*n*,<=*s*<=≠<=*e*) — the total number of chairs, starting and ending positions of Scott.

He lives by an unusual park. The park is a rooted tree consisting of *n* vertices with the root at vertex 1. Vertex 1 also contains Kefa's house. Unfortunaely for our hero, the park also contains cats. Kefa has already found out what are the vertices with cats in them.

The leaf vertices of the park contain restaurants. Kefa wants to choose a restaurant where he will go, but unfortunately he is very afraid of cats, so there is no way he will go to the restaurant if the path from the restaurant to his house contains more than *m* consecutive vertices with cats. 

Your task is to help Kefa count the number of restaurants where he can go.","The first line contains two integers, *n* and *m* (2<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105, 1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=*n*) — the number of vertices of the tree and the maximum number of consecutive vertices with cats that is still ok for Kefa.

The second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*, where each *a**i* either equals to 0 (then vertex *i* has no cat), or equals to 1 (then vertex *i* has a cat).

Recently at the BSU was an important test work on which Vasya recived the mark *a*. It is very hard for the teacher to remember the exact mark of every student, but he knows the mark *b*, such that every student recieved mark strictly smaller than *b*.

Vasya isn't satisfied with his mark so he decided to improve it. He can swap characters in the string corresponding to his mark as many times as he like. Now he want to know only the number of different ways to improve his mark so that his teacher didn't notice something suspicious.

More formally: you are given two strings *a*, *b* of the same length and you need to figure out the number of different strings *c* such that:

1) *c* can be obtained from *a* by swapping some characters, in other words *c* is a permutation of *a*.

2) String *a* is lexicographically smaller than *c*.

3) String *c* is lexicographically smaller than *b*.

For two strings *x* and *y* of the same length it is true that *x* is lexicographically smaller than *y* if there exists such *i*, that *x*1<==<=*y*1,<=*x*2<==<=*y*2,<=...,<=*x**i*<=-<=1<==<=*y**i*<=-<=1,<=*x**i*<=&lt;<=*y**i*.

However, despite the fact that B is sure that he corrected the two errors, he can not understand exactly what compilation errors disappeared — the compiler of the language which B uses shows errors in the new order every time! B is sure that unlike many other programming languages, compilation errors for his programming language do not depend on each other, that is, if you correct one error, the set of other error does not change.

Can you help B find out exactly what two errors he corrected?","The first line of the input contains integer *n* (3<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105) — the initial number of compilation errors.

253,C,Text Editor,PROGRAMMING,"['data structures', 'dfs and similar', 'graphs', 'greedy', 'shortest paths']","Vasya is pressing the keys on the keyboard reluctantly, squeezing out his ideas on the classical epos depicted in Homer's Odysseus... How can he explain to his literature teacher that he isn't going to become a writer? In fact, he is going to become a programmer. So, he would take great pleasure in writing a program, but none — in writing a composition.

As Vasya was fishing for a sentence in the dark pond of his imagination, he suddenly wondered: what is the least number of times he should push a key to shift the cursor from one position to another one?

Let's describe his question more formally: to type a text, Vasya is using the text editor. He has already written *n* lines, the *i*-th line contains *a**i* characters (including spaces). If some line contains *k* characters, then this line overall contains (*k*<=+<=1) positions where the cursor can stand: before some character or after all characters (at the end of the line). Thus, the cursor's position is determined by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*), where *r* is the number of the line and *c* is the cursor's position in the line (the positions are indexed starting from one from the beginning of the line).

Vasya doesn't use the mouse to move the cursor. He uses keys ""Up"", ""Down"", ""Right"" and ""Left"". When he pushes each of these keys, the cursor shifts in the needed direction. Let's assume that before the corresponding key is pressed, the cursor was located in the position (*r*,<=*c*), then Vasya pushed key:
-  ""Up"": if the cursor was located in the first line (*r*<==<=1), then it does not move. Otherwise, it moves to the previous line (with number *r*<=-<=1), to the same position. At that, if the previous line was short, that is, the cursor couldn't occupy position *c* there, the cursor moves to the last position of the line with number *r*<=-<=1;-  ""Down"": if the cursor was located in the last line (*r*<==<=*n*), then it does not move. Otherwise, it moves to the next line (with number *r*<=+<=1), to the same position. At that, if the next line was short, that is, the cursor couldn't occupy position *c* there, the cursor moves to the last position of the line with number *r*<=+<=1;-  ""Right"": if the cursor can move to the right in this line (*c*<=&lt;<=*a**r*<=+<=1), then it moves to the right (to position *c*<=+<=1). Otherwise, it is located at the end of the line and doesn't move anywhere when Vasya presses the ""Right"" key;-  ""Left"": if the cursor can move to the left in this line (*c*<=&gt;<=1), then it moves to the left (to position *c*<=-<=1). Otherwise, it is located at the beginning of the line and doesn't move anywhere when Vasya presses the ""Left"" key.
You've got the number of lines in the text file and the number of characters, written in each line of this file. Find the least number of times Vasya should push the keys, described above, to shift the cursor from position (*r*1,<=*c*1) to position (*r*2,<=*c*2).","The first line of the input contains an integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100) — the number of lines in the file. The second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=≤<=*a**i*<=≤<=105), separated by single spaces. The third line contains four integers *r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2 (1<=≤<=*r*1,<=*r*2<=≤<=*n*,<=1<=≤<=*c*1<=≤<=*a**r*1<=+<=1,<=1<=≤<=*c*2<=≤<=*a**r*2<=+<=1).","Print a single integer — the minimum number of times Vasya should push a key to move the cursor from position (*r*1,<=*c*1) to position (*r*2,<=*c*2).","['4\n2 1 6 4\n3 4 4 2\n', '4\n10 5 6 4\n1 11 4 2\n', '3\n10 1 10\n1 10 1 1\n']","['3\n', '6\n', '3\n']","In the first sample the editor contains four lines. Let's represent the cursor's possible positions in the line as numbers. Letter *s* represents the cursor's initial position, letter *t* represents the last one. Then all possible positions of the cursor in the text editor are described by the following table.

98,B,Help King,PROGRAMMING,"['implementation', 'probabilities', 'trees']","This is the modification of the problem used during the official round. Unfortunately, author's solution of the original problem appeared wrong, so the problem was changed specially for the archive.

Once upon a time in a far away kingdom lived the King. The King had a beautiful daughter, Victoria. They lived happily, but not happily ever after: one day a vicious dragon attacked the kingdom and stole Victoria. The King was full of grief, yet he gathered his noble knights and promised half of his kingdom and Victoria's hand in marriage to the one who will save the girl from the infernal beast.

Having travelled for some time, the knights found the dragon's lair and all of them rushed there to save Victoria. Each knight spat on the dragon once and, as the dragon had quite a fragile and frail heart, his heart broke and poor beast died. As for the noble knights, they got Victoria right to the King and started brawling as each one wanted the girl's hand in marriage.

The problem was that all the noble knights were equally noble and equally handsome, and Victoria didn't want to marry any of them anyway. Then the King (and he was a very wise man and didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings) decided to find out who will get his daughter randomly, i.e. tossing a coin. However, there turned out to be *n* noble knights and the coin only has two sides. The good thing is that when a coin is tossed, the coin falls on each side with equal probability. The King got interested how to pick one noble knight using this coin so that all knights had equal probability of being chosen (the probability in that case should always be equal to 1<=/<=*n*). First the King wants to know the expected number of times he will need to toss a coin to determine the winner. Besides, while tossing the coin, the King should follow the optimal tossing strategy (i.e. the strategy that minimizes the expected number of tosses). Help the King in this challenging task.",The first line contains a single integer *n* from the problem's statement (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=10000).,"Print the sought expected number of tosses as an irreducible fraction in the following form: ""*a*/*b*"" (without the quotes) without leading zeroes.","['2\n', '3\n', '4\n']","['1/1\n', '8/3\n', '2/1\n']",none,COMPILATION_ERROR,"import math

A natural problem occurred: on the one hand, it is not clear how many T-shirts of what sizes should be ordered, and on the other hand, one doesn't want to order too many T-shirts (and we do not exactly paper the walls with the oversupply). After considerable brain racking and some pre-estimating, the sponsor representatives ordered a certain number of T-shirts of sizes S, M, L, XL and XXL. The T-shirts turned out to bring good luck, that's why on the contest day there built up a line of *K* participants willing to get one. Every contestant is characterized by his/her desired T-shirt size (so it happens that for all the participants it is also one of the sizes S, M, L, XL and XXL). The participants come up to get a T-shirt one by one and try to choose the most suitable one, choosing it like this. If there is still a T-shirt of the optimal size left, that he/she takes it without further ado. Otherwise the contestant would prefer to choose a T-shirt with the size as close to the optimal one as possible (the distance between neighboring sizes is considered equal to one). If the variant of choice is not unique, the contestant will take a T-shirt of a bigger size (in case he/she grows more). For example, for a person whose optimal size is L the preference list looks like this: L, XL, M, XXL, S. Using the data on how many T-shirts of every size had been ordered by the organizers, on the size of contestants in the line determine who got a T-shirt of what size.","The first line contains five non-negative integers *N**S*,<=*N**M*,<=*N**L*,<=*N**XL*,<=*N**XXL* not exceeding 1000 which represent the number of T-shirts of the corresponding sizes.

186,B,Growing Mushrooms,PROGRAMMING,"['greedy', 'sortings']","Each year in the castle of Dwarven King there is a competition in growing mushrooms among the dwarves. The competition is one of the most prestigious ones, and the winner gets a wooden salad bowl. This year's event brought together the best mushroom growers from around the world, so we had to slightly change the rules so that the event gets more interesting to watch.

Each mushroom grower has a mushroom that he will grow on the competition. Under the new rules, the competition consists of two parts. The first part lasts *t*1 seconds and the second part lasts *t*2 seconds. The first and the second part are separated by a little break.

After the starting whistle the first part of the contest starts, and all mushroom growers start growing mushrooms at once, each at his individual speed of *v**i* meters per second. After *t*1 seconds, the mushroom growers stop growing mushrooms and go to have a break. During the break, for unexplained reasons, the growth of all mushrooms is reduced by *k* percent. After the break the second part of the contest starts and all mushrooms growers at the same time continue to grow mushrooms, each at his individual speed of *u**i* meters per second. After a *t*2 seconds after the end of the break, the competition ends. Note that the speeds before and after the break may vary.

Before the match dwarf Pasha learned from all participants, what two speeds they have chosen. However, the participants did not want to disclose to him all their strategy and therefore, did not say in what order they will be using these speeds. That is, if a participant chose speeds *a**i* and *b**i*, then there are two strategies: he either uses speed *a**i* before the break and speed *b**i* after it, or vice versa.

Dwarf Pasha really wants to win the totalizer. He knows that each participant chooses the strategy that maximizes the height of the mushroom. Help Dwarf Pasha make the final table of competition results.

The participants are sorted in the result table by the mushroom height (the participants with higher mushrooms follow earlier in the table). In case of equal mushroom heights, the participants are sorted by their numbers (the participants with a smaller number follow earlier).","The first input line contains four integer numbers *n*, *t*1, *t*2, *k* (1<=≤<=*n*,<=*t*1,<=*t*2<=≤<=1000; 1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=100) — the number of participants, the time before the break, the time after the break and the percentage, by which the mushroom growth drops during the break, correspondingly.

Each of the following *n* lines contains two integers. The *i*-th (1<=≤<=*i*<=≤<=*n*) line contains space-separated integers *a**i*, *b**i* (1<=≤<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=≤<=1000) — the speeds which the participant number *i* chose.","Print the final results' table: *n* lines, each line should contain the number of the corresponding dwarf and the final maximum height of his mushroom with exactly two digits after the decimal point.

412,A,Poster,PROGRAMMING,"['greedy', 'implementation']","The R1 company has recently bought a high rise building in the centre of Moscow for its main office. It's time to decorate the new office, and the first thing to do is to write the company's slogan above the main entrance to the building.

The slogan of the company consists of *n* characters, so the decorators hung a large banner, *n* meters wide and 1 meter high, divided into *n* equal squares. The first character of the slogan must be in the first square (the leftmost) of the poster, the second character must be in the second square, and so on.

Of course, the R1 programmers want to write the slogan on the poster themselves. To do this, they have a large (and a very heavy) ladder which was put exactly opposite the *k*-th square of the poster. To draw the *i*-th character of the slogan on the poster, you need to climb the ladder, standing in front of the *i*-th square of the poster. This action (along with climbing up and down the ladder) takes one hour for a painter. The painter is not allowed to draw characters in the adjacent squares when the ladder is in front of the *i*-th square because the uncomfortable position of the ladder may make the characters untidy. Besides, the programmers can move the ladder. In one hour, they can move the ladder either a meter to the right or a meter to the left.

Drawing characters and moving the ladder is very tiring, so the programmers want to finish the job in as little time as possible. Develop for them an optimal poster painting plan!","The first line contains two integers, *n* and *k* (1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100) — the number of characters in the slogan and the initial position of the ladder, correspondingly. The next line contains the slogan as *n* characters written without spaces. Each character of the slogan is either a large English letter, or digit, or one of the characters: '.', '!', ',', '?'.","In *t* lines, print the actions the programmers need to make. In the *i*-th line print:
 -  ""LEFT"" (without the quotes), if the *i*-th action was ""move the ladder to the left""; -  ""RIGHT"" (without the quotes), if the *i*-th action was ""move the ladder to the right""; -  ""PRINT *x*"" (without the quotes), if the *i*-th action was to ""go up the ladder, paint character *x*, go down the ladder"". 
The painting time (variable *t*) must be minimum possible. If there are multiple optimal painting plans, you can print any of them.","['2 2\nR1\n', '2 1\nR1\n', '6 4\nGO?GO!\n']","['PRINT 1\nLEFT\nPRINT R\n', 'PRINT R\nRIGHT\nPRINT 1\n', 'RIGHT\nRIGHT\nPRINT !\nLEFT\nPRINT O\nLEFT\nPRINT G\nLEFT\nPRINT ?\nLEFT\nPRINT O\nLEFT\nPRINT G\n']","Note that the ladder cannot be shifted by less than one meter.

He has already counted the time he wastes sleeping and eating. And now Mr. Scrooge wants to count the time he has wasted signing papers.

Mr. Scrooge's signature can be represented as a polyline *A*1*A*2... *A**n*. Scrooge signs like that: first it places a pen at the point *A*1, then draws a segment from point *A*1 to point *A*2, then he draws a segment from point *A*2 to point *A*3 and so on to point *A**n*, where he stops signing and takes the pen off the paper. At that the resulting line can intersect with itself and partially repeat itself but Scrooge pays no attention to it and never changes his signing style. As Scrooge makes the signature, he never takes the pen off the paper and his writing speed is constant — 50 millimeters per second.

Scrooge signed exactly *k* papers throughout his life and all those signatures look the same.

A substring *s*[*l*... *r*] (1<=≤<=*l*<=≤<=*r*<=≤<=|*s*|) of string *s*<==<=*s*1*s*2... *s*|*s*| (where |*s*| is the length of string *s*) is string *s**l**s**l*<=+<=1... *s**r*.

String *x*<==<=*x*1*x*2... *x**p* is lexicographically smaller than string *y*<==<=*y*1*y*2... *y**q*, if either *p*<=&lt;<=*q* and *x*1<==<=*y*1,<=*x*2<==<=*y*2,<=... ,<=*x**p*<==<=*y**p*, or there exists such number *r* (*r*<=&lt;<=*p*,<=*r*<=&lt;<=*q*), that *x*1<==<=*y*1,<=*x*2<==<=*y*2,<=... ,<=*x**r*<==<=*y**r* and *x**r*<=+<=1<=&lt;<=*y**r*<=+<=1. The string characters are compared by their ASCII codes.","The first line contains integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=30) — the number of titles you've got to consider. Then follow *n* problem titles, one per line. Each title only consists of lowercase English letters (specifically, it doesn't contain any spaces) and has the length from 1 to 20, inclusive.","Print a string, consisting of lowercase English letters — the lexicographically minimum shortest original title.","['5\nthreehorses\ngoodsubstrings\nsecret\nprimematrix\nbeautifulyear\n', '4\naa\nbdefghijklmn\nopqrstuvwxyz\nc\n']","['j\n', 'ab\n']","In the first sample the first 9 letters of the English alphabet (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i) occur in the problem titles, so the answer is letter j.

 — Of course, my Smart Beaver! Let us enjoy the splendid view together. How about Friday night? 

At this point the Smart Beaver got rushing. Everything should be perfect by Friday, so he needed to prepare the belt to the upcoming walk. He needed to cut down several trees.

Let's consider the woodland belt as a sequence of trees. Each tree *i* is described by the esthetic appeal *a**i* — some trees are very esthetically pleasing, others are 'so-so', and some trees are positively ugly!

The Smart Beaver calculated that he needed the following effects to win the Beaverette's heart: 
 -  The first objective is to please the Beaverette: the sum of esthetic appeal of the remaining trees must be maximum possible; -  the second objective is to surprise the Beaverette: the esthetic appeal of the first and the last trees in the resulting belt must be the same; -  and of course, the walk should be successful: there must be at least two trees in the woodland belt left. 
Now help the Smart Beaver! Which trees does he need to cut down to win the Beaverette's heart?","The first line contains a single integer *n* — the initial number of trees in the woodland belt, 2<=≤<=*n*. The second line contains space-separated integers *a**i* — the esthetic appeals of each tree. All esthetic appeals do not exceed 109 in their absolute value.
 -  to get 30 points, you need to solve the problem with constraints: *n*<=≤<=100 (subproblem A1); -  to get 100 points, you need to solve the problem with constraints: *n*<=≤<=3·105 (subproblems A1+A2).","In the first line print two integers — the total esthetic appeal of the woodland belt after the Smart Beaver's intervention and the number of the cut down trees *k*.

In the next line print *k* integers — the numbers of the trees the Beaver needs to cut down. Assume that the trees are numbered from 1 to *n* from left to right.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It is guaranteed that at least two trees have equal esthetic appeal.","['5\n1 2 3 1 2\n', '5\n1 -2 3 1 -2\n']","['8 1\n1 ', '5 2\n2 5 ']",none,WRONG_ANSWER,"from math import inf

Then at one turn Barney swaps the cup in the middle with any of other two cups randomly (he choses each with equal probability), so the chosen cup becomes the middle one. Game lasts *n* turns and Barney independently choses a cup to swap with the middle one within each turn, and the key always remains in the cup it was at the start.

After *n*-th turn Barney asks a girl to guess which cup contains the key. The girl points to the middle one but Barney was distracted while making turns and doesn't know if the key is under the middle cup. That's why he asked you to tell him the probability that girl guessed right.

Number *n* of game turns can be extremely large, that's why Barney did not give it to you. Instead he gave you an array *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**k* such that

The village is also well-structured: house *i* and house *i*<=+<=1 (1<=≤<=*i*<=&lt;<=*n*) are exactly 10 meters away. In this village, some houses are occupied, and some are not. Indeed, unoccupied houses can be purchased.

You will be given *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* that denote the availability and the prices of the houses. If house *i* is occupied, and therefore cannot be bought, then *a**i* equals 0. Otherwise, house *i* can be bought, and *a**i* represents the money required to buy it, in dollars.

As Zane has only *k* dollars to spare, it becomes a challenge for him to choose the house to purchase, so that he could live as near as possible to his crush.

Stones fall from a mountain. Initially Squirrel Liss occupies an interval [0,<=1]. Next, *n* stones will fall and Liss will escape from the stones. The stones are numbered from 1 to *n* in order.

The stones always fall to the center of Liss's interval. When Liss occupies the interval [*k*<=-<=*d*,<=*k*<=+<=*d*] and a stone falls to *k*, she will escape to the left or to the right.

The sum of numbers at the opposite dice faces always equals 7. Please note that there are only two dice (these dices are mirror of each other) that satisfy the given constraints (both of them are shown on the picture on the left).

Alice and Bob play dice. Alice has built a tower from *n* dice. We know that in this tower the adjacent dice contact with faces with distinct numbers. Bob wants to uniquely identify the numbers written on the faces of all dice, from which the tower is built. Unfortunately, Bob is looking at the tower from the face, and so he does not see all the numbers on the faces. Bob sees the number on the top of the tower and the numbers on the two adjacent sides (on the right side of the picture shown what Bob sees).

Help Bob, tell whether it is possible to uniquely identify the numbers on the faces of all the dice in the tower, or not.","The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=100) — the number of dice in the tower.

Especially he is interested if Bob is better at playing different games than the previous model, ""Alice"". 

So now Ilya wants to compare his robots' performance in a simple game called ""1-2-3"". This game is similar to the ""Rock-Paper-Scissors"" game: both robots secretly choose a number from the set {1,<=2,<=3} and say it at the same moment. If both robots choose the same number, then it's a draw and noone gets any points. But if chosen numbers are different, then one of the robots gets a point: 3 beats 2, 2 beats 1 and 1 beats 3. 

Both robots' programs make them choose their numbers in such a way that their choice in (*i*<=+<=1)-th game depends only on the numbers chosen by them in *i*-th game. 

Ilya knows that the robots will play *k* games, Alice will choose number *a* in the first game, and Bob will choose *b* in the first game.

Yakko thrown a die and got Y points, Wakko — W points. It was Dot's turn. But she didn't hurry. Dot wanted to know for sure what were her chances to visit Transylvania.

To play durak you need a pack of 36 cards. Each card has a suit (""S"", ""H"", ""D"" and ""C"") and a rank (in the increasing order ""6"", ""7"", ""8"", ""9"", ""T"", ""J"", ""Q"", ""K"" and ""A""). At the beginning of the game one suit is arbitrarily chosen as trump. 

The players move like that: one player puts one or several of his cards on the table and the other one should beat each of them with his cards.

A card beats another one if both cards have similar suits and the first card has a higher rank then the second one. Besides, a trump card can beat any non-trump card whatever the cards’ ranks are. In all other cases you can not beat the second card with the first one.

You are given the trump suit and two different cards. Determine whether the first one beats the second one or not.","The first line contains the tramp suit. It is ""S"", ""H"", ""D"" or ""C"".

But the Wi-Fi condition is so poor that Dreamoon's smartphone reports some of the commands can't be recognized and Dreamoon knows that some of them might even be wrong though successfully recognized. Dreamoon decides to follow every recognized command and toss a fair coin to decide those unrecognized ones (that means, he moves to the 1 unit to the negative or positive direction with the same probability 0.5). 

You are given an original list of commands sent by Drazil and list received by Dreamoon.

You are given geometric progression *b* defined by two integers *b*1 and *q*. Remind that a geometric progression is a sequence of integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=*b*3,<=..., where for each *i*<=&gt;<=1 the respective term satisfies the condition *b**i*<==<=*b**i*<=-<=1·*q*, where *q* is called the common ratio of the progression. Progressions in Uzhlyandia are unusual: both *b*1 and *q* can equal 0. Also, Dvastan gave Masha *m* ""bad"" integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**m*, and an integer *l*.

Masha writes all progression terms one by one onto the board (including repetitive) while condition |*b**i*|<=≤<=*l* is satisfied (|*x*| means absolute value of *x*). There is an exception: if a term equals one of the ""bad"" integers, Masha skips it (doesn't write onto the board) and moves forward to the next term.

But the lesson is going to end soon, so Masha has to calculate how many integers will be written on the board. In order not to get into depression, Masha asked you for help: help her calculate how many numbers she will write, or print ""inf"" in case she needs to write infinitely many integers.","The first line of input contains four integers *b*1, *q*, *l*, *m* (-109<=≤<=*b*1,<=*q*<=≤<=109, 1<=≤<=*l*<=≤<=109, 1<=≤<=*m*<=≤<=105) — the initial term and the common ratio of progression, absolute value of maximal number that can be written on the board and the number of ""bad"" integers, respectively.

Right now his task is to make a series of reports about the company's performance for the last *n* days. We know that the main information in a day report is value *a**i*, the company's profit on the *i*-th day. If *a**i* is negative, then the company suffered losses on the *i*-th day.

Polycarpus should sort the daily reports into folders. Each folder should include data on the company's performance for several consecutive days. Of course, the information on each of the *n* days should be exactly in one folder. Thus, Polycarpus puts information on the first few days in the first folder. The information on the several following days goes to the second folder, and so on.

It is known that the boss reads one daily report folder per day. If one folder has three or more reports for the days in which the company suffered losses (*a**i*<=&lt;<=0), he loses his temper and his wrath is terrible.

Therefore, Polycarpus wants to prepare the folders so that none of them contains information on three or more days with the loss, and the number of folders is minimal.

Valera has also found out that the ski resort had multiple ski tracks. Specifically, for each object *v*, the resort has at most one object *u*, such that there is a ski track built from object *u* to object *v*. We also know that no hotel has got a ski track leading from the hotel to some object.

Valera is afraid of getting lost on the resort. So he wants you to come up with a path he would walk along. The path must consist of objects *v*1,<=*v*2,<=...,<=*v**k* (*k*<=≥<=1) and meet the following conditions:
 1.  Objects with numbers *v*1,<=*v*2,<=...,<=*v**k*<=-<=1 are mountains and the object with number *v**k* is the hotel. 1.  For any integer *i* (1<=≤<=*i*<=&lt;<=*k*), there is exactly one ski track leading from object *v**i*. This track goes to object *v**i*<=+<=1. 1.

Sometimes they receive parcels from Uncle Fyodor’s parents and sometimes from anonymous benefactors, in which case it is hard to determine to which one of them the package has been sent. A photographic rifle is obviously for Sharic who loves hunting and fish is for Matroskin, but for whom was a new video game console meant? Every one of the three friends claimed that the present is for him and nearly quarreled. Uncle Fyodor had an idea how to solve the problem justly: they should suppose that the console was sent to all three of them and play it in turns. Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up — who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that’s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player wins. Otherwise, another game round is required.

The grandmother has a large garden, which can be represented as a rectangle 1<=×<=*n* in size, when viewed from above. This rectangle is divided into *n* equal square sections. The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.

Creating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section. At that, the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section. That is, for example, the garden can be represented by a 1<=×<=5 rectangle, where the section heights are equal to 4, 2, 3, 3, 2.

Your task is to reorder the letters in the string *s* in such a way that the resulting string is a *k*-string.","The first input line contains integer *k* (1<=≤<=*k*<=≤<=1000). The second line contains *s*, all characters in *s* are lowercase English letters. The string length *s* satisfies the inequality 1<=≤<=|*s*|<=≤<=1000, where |*s*| is the length of string *s*.","Rearrange the letters in string *s* in such a way that the result is a *k*-string. Print the result on a single output line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

If the solution doesn't exist, print ""-1"" (without quotes).","['2\naazz\n', '3\nabcabcabz\n']","['azaz\n', '-1\n']",none,WRONG_ANSWER,"k=int(input())
