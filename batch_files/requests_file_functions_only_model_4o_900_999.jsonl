Write a python script for the following problem: Each year in the castle of Dwarven King there is a competition in growing mushrooms among the dwarves. The competition is one of the most prestigious ones, and the winner gets a wooden salad bowl. This year's event brought together the best mushroom growers from around the world, so we had to slightly change the rules so that the event gets more interesting to watch.\n\nEach mushroom grower has a mushroom that he will grow on the competition. Under the new rules, the competition consists of two parts. The first part lasts *t*1 seconds and the second part lasts *t*2 seconds. The first and the second part are separated by a little break.\n\nAfter the starting whistle the first part of the contest starts, and all mushroom growers start growing mushrooms at once, each at his individual speed of *v**i* meters per second. After *t*1 seconds, the mushroom growers stop growing mushrooms and go to have a break. During the break, for unexplained reasons, the growth of all mushrooms is reduced by *k* percent. After the break the second part of the contest starts and all mushrooms growers at the same time continue to grow mushrooms, each at his individual speed of *u**i* meters per second. After a *t*2 seconds after the end of the break, the competition ends. Note that the speeds before and after the break may vary.\n\nBefore the match dwarf Pasha learned from all participants, what two speeds they have chosen. However, the participants did not want to disclose to him all their strategy and therefore, did not say in what order they will be using these speeds. That is, if a participant chose speeds *a**i* and *b**i*, then there are two strategies: he either uses speed *a**i* before the break and speed *b**i* after it, or vice versa.\n\nDwarf Pasha really wants to win the totalizer. He knows that each participant chooses the strategy that maximizes the height of the mushroom. Help Dwarf Pasha make the final table of competition results.\n\nThe participants are sorted in the result table by the mushroom height (the participants with higher mushrooms follow earlier in the table). In case of equal mushroom heights, the participants are sorted by their numbers (the participants with a smaller number follow earlier).\nInput specification: The first input line contains four integer numbers *n*, *t*1, *t*2, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*t*1,<=*t*2<=\u2264<=1000;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of participants, the time before the break, the time after the break and the percentage, by which the mushroom growth drops during the break, correspondingly.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains two integers. The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) line contains space-separated integers *a**i*, *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the speeds which the participant number *i* chose..

To do this, they have a large (and a very heavy) ladder which was put exactly opposite the *k*-th square of the poster. To draw the *i*-th character of the slogan on the poster, you need to climb the ladder, standing in front of the *i*-th square of the poster. This action (along with climbing up and down the ladder) takes one hour for a painter.

There are four types of acceptable questions:\n -  Is it true that *y* is strictly larger than number *x*? -  Is it true that *y* is strictly smaller than number *x*? -  Is it true that *y* is larger than or equal to number *x*? -  Is it true that *y* is smaller than or equal to number *x*? \nOn each question the host answers truthfully, \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\nGiven the sequence of questions and answers, find any integer value of *y* that meets the criteria of all answers. If there isn't such value, print \"Impossible\".\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=10000) \u2014 the number of questions (and answers). Next *n* lines each contain one question and one answer to it. The format of each line is like that: \"sign x answer\", where the sign is:\n -  \"&gt;\" (for the first type queries), -  \"&lt;\" (for the second type queries), -  \"&gt;=\" (for the third type queries), -  \"&lt;=\" (for the fourth type queries). \nAll values of *x* are integer and meet the inequation <=-<=109<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=109. The answer is an English letter \"Y\" (for \"yes\") or \"N\" (for \"no\").\n\nConsequtive elements in lines are separated by a single space.. Output specification: Print any of such integers *y*, that the answers to all the queries are correct. The printed number *y* must meet the inequation <=-<=2\u00b7109<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7109. If there are many answers, print any of them. If such value doesn't exist, print word \"Impossible\" (without the quotes).\nDemo input: ['4\\n&gt;= 1 Y\\n&lt; 3 N\\n&lt;= -3 N\\n&gt; 55 N\\n', '2\\n&gt; 100 Y\\n&lt; -100 Y\\n'], Demo output: ['17\\n', 'Impossible\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Yakko, Wakko and Dot, world-famous animaniacs, decided to rest from acting in cartoons, and take a leave to travel a bit. Yakko dreamt to go to Pennsylvania, his Motherland and the Motherland of his ancestors. Wakko thought about Tasmania, its beaches, sun and sea. Dot chose Transylvania as the most mysterious and unpredictable place.\n\nBut to their great regret, the leave turned to be very short, so it will be enough to visit one of the three above named places. That's why Yakko, as the cleverest, came up with a truly genius idea: let each of the three roll an ordinary six-sided die, and the one with the highest amount of points will be the winner, and will take the other two to the place of his/her dreams.\n\nYakko thrown a die and got Y points, Wakko \u2014 W points. It was Dot's turn. But she didn't hurry. Dot wanted to know for sure what were her chances to visit Transylvania.\n\nIt is known that Yakko and Wakko are true gentlemen, that's why if they have the same amount of points with Dot, they will let Dot win.\nInput specification: The only line of the input file contains two natural numbers Y and W \u2014 the results of Yakko's and Wakko's die rolls..

Right now his task is to make a series of reports about the company's performance for the last *n* days. We know that the main information in a day report is value *a**i*, the company's profit on the *i*-th day. If *a**i* is negative, then the company suffered losses on the *i*-th day.\n\nPolycarpus should sort the daily reports into folders. Each folder should include data on the company's performance for several consecutive days. Of course, the information on each of the *n* days should be exactly in one folder. Thus, Polycarpus puts information on the first few days in the first folder. The information on the several following days goes to the second folder, and so on.\n\nIt is known that the boss reads one daily report folder per day. If one folder has three or more reports for the days in which the company suffered losses (*a**i*<=&lt;<=0), he loses his temper and his wrath is terrible.\n\nTherefore, Polycarpus wants to prepare the folders so that none of them contains information on three or more days with the loss, and the number of folders is minimal.\n\nWrite a program that, given sequence *a**i*, will print the minimum number of folders.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), *n* is the number of days. The second line contains a sequence of integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (|*a**i*|<=\u2264<=100), where *a**i* means the company profit on the *i*-th day. It is possible that the company has no days with the negative *a**i*.. Output specification: Print an integer *k* \u2014 the required minimum number of folders. In the second line print a sequence of integers *b*1, *b*2, ..., *b**k*, where *b**j* is the number of day reports in the *j*-th folder.\n\nIf there are multiple ways to sort the reports into *k* days, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['11\\n1 2 3 -4 -5 -6 5 -5 -6 -7 6\\n', '5\\n0 -1 100 -1 0\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n5 3 3 ', '1\\n5 ']\nNote: Here goes a way to sort the reports from the first sample into three folders: \n\nIn the second sample you can put all five reports in one folder."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Bash likes playing with arrays. He has an array *a*1,<=*a*2,<=... *a**n* of *n* integers. He likes to guess the greatest common divisor (gcd) of different segments of the array. Of course, sometimes the guess is not correct. However, Bash will be satisfied if his guess is almost correct.\n\nSuppose he guesses that the gcd of the elements in the range [*l*,<=*r*] of *a* is *x*. He considers the guess to be almost correct if he can change at most one element in the segment such that the gcd of the segment is *x* after making the change. Note that when he guesses, he doesn't actually change the array \u2014 he just wonders if the gcd of the segment can be made *x*. Apart from this, he also sometimes makes changes to the array itself.\n\nSince he can't figure it out himself, Bash wants you to tell him which of his guesses are almost correct. Formally, you have to process *q* queries of one of the following forms:\n -  1<=*l*<=*r*<=*x* \u2014 Bash guesses that the gcd of the range [*l*,<=*r*] is *x*.

Uncle Fyodor had an idea how to solve the problem justly: they should suppose that the console was sent to all three of them and play it in turns. Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up \u2014 who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that\u2019s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player wins.

For example, the string \"aabaabaabaab\" is at the same time a 1-string, a 2-string and a 4-string, but it is not a 3-string, a 5-string, or a 6-string and so on. Obviously any string is a 1-string.\n\nYou are given a string *s*, consisting of lowercase English letters and a positive integer *k*. Your task is to reorder the letters in the string *s* in such a way that the resulting string is a *k*-string.\nInput specification: The first input line contains integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=1000). The second line contains *s*, all characters in *s* are lowercase English letters. The string length *s* satisfies the inequality 1<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=1000, where |*s*| is the length of string *s*.. Output specification: Rearrange the letters in string *s* in such a way that the result is a *k*-string. Print the result on a single output line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\nIf the solution doesn't exist, print \"-1\" (without quotes).\nDemo input: ['2\\naazz\\n', '3\\nabcabcabz\\n'], Demo output: ['azaz\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}
