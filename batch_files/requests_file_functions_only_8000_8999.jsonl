Write a python script for the following problem: Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.\n\nShop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following *n* days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in *i*-th day *k**i* products will be put up for sale and exactly *l**i* clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any *f* days from *n* next for sell-outs. On each of *f* chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on *i*-th day shop planned to put up for sale *k**i* products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7*k**i* products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.\n\nNoora's task is to choose *f* days to maximize total number of sold products.

In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2,\u20096,\u20092,\u20092] respectively.

Write a python script for the following problem: Most C/C++ programmers know about excellent opportunities that preprocessor #define directives give; but many know as well about the problems that can arise because of their careless use.\n\nIn this problem we consider the following model of #define constructions (also called macros). Each macro has its name and value. The generic syntax for declaring a macro is the following:\n\n#define macro_name macro_value\n\nAfter the macro has been declared, \"macro_name\" is replaced with \"macro_value\" each time it is met in the program (only the whole tokens can be replaced; i.e. \"macro_name\" is replaced only when it is surrounded by spaces or other non-alphabetic symbol). A \"macro_value\" within our model can only be an arithmetic expression consisting of variables, four arithmetic operations, brackets, and also the names of previously declared macros (in this case replacement is performed sequentially). The process of replacing macros with their values is called substitution.\n\nOne of the main problems arising while using macros \u2014 the situation when as a result of substitution we get an arithmetic expression with the changed order of calculation because of different priorities of the operations.\n\nLet's consider the following example. Say, we declared such a #define construction:\n\n#define sum x + y\n\nand further in the program the expression \"2 * sum\" is calculated. After macro substitution is performed we get \"2 * x + y\", instead of intuitively expected \"2 * (x + y)\".\n\nLet's call the situation \"suspicious\", if after the macro substitution the order of calculation changes, falling outside the bounds of some macro. Thus, your task is to find out by the given set of #define definitions and the given expression if this expression is suspicious or not.\n\nLet's speak more formally. We should perform an ordinary macros substitution in the given expression. Moreover, we should perform a \"safe\" macros substitution in the expression, putting in brackets each macro value; after this, guided by arithmetic rules of brackets expansion, we can omit some of the brackets. If there exist a way to get an expression, absolutely coinciding with the expression that is the result of an ordinary substitution (character-by-character, but ignoring spaces), then this expression and the macros system are called correct, otherwise \u2014 suspicious.\n\nNote that we consider the \"/\" operation as the usual mathematical division, not the integer division like in C/C++. That's why, for example, in the expression \"a*(b/c)\" we can omit brackets to get the expression \"a*b/c\".\nInput specification: The first line contains the only number *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the amount of #define constructions in the given program.\n\nThen there follow *n* lines, each of them contains just one #define construction. Each construction has the following syntax:\n\n#define name expression\n\nwhere\n -  name \u2014 the macro name, -  expression \u2014 the expression with which the given macro will be replaced. An expression is a non-empty string, containing digits,names of variables, names of previously declared macros, round brackets and operational signs +-*/. It is guaranteed that the expression (before and after macros substitution) is a correct arithmetic expression, having no unary operations. The expression contains only non-negative integers, not exceeding 109. \nAll the names (#define constructions' names and names of their arguments) are strings of case-sensitive Latin characters. It is guaranteed that the name of any variable is different from any #define construction.\n\nThen, the last line contains an expression that you are to check. This expression is non-empty and satisfies the same limitations as the expressions in #define constructions.\n\nThe input lines may contain any number of spaces anywhere, providing these spaces do not break the word \"define\" or the names of constructions and variables. In particular, there can be any number of spaces before and after the \"#\" symbol.\n\nThe length of any line from the input file does not exceed 100 characters.. Output specification: Output \"OK\", if the expression is correct according to the above given criterion, otherwise output \"Suspicious\".\nDemo input: ['1\\n#define sum x + y\\n1 * sum\\n', '1\\n#define sum  (x + y)\\nsum - sum\\n', '4\\n#define sum  x + y\\n#define mul  a * b\\n#define div  a / b\\n#define expr sum + mul * div * mul\\nexpr\\n', '3\\n#define SumSafe   (a+b)\\n#define DivUnsafe  a/b\\n#define DenominatorUnsafe  a*b\\n((SumSafe) + DivUnsafe/DivUnsafe + x/DenominatorUnsafe)\\n'], Demo output: ['Suspicious\\n', 'OK\\n', 'OK\\n', 'Suspicious\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Help Polycarp determine all projects that his project depends on (directly or via a certain chain). \n\nIt's possible that Polycarp's project depends on two different versions of some project. In this case collision resolving is applied, i.e. for each such project the system chooses the version that minimizes the distance from it to Polycarp's project. If there are several options, the newer (with the maximum version) is preferred. This version is considered actual; other versions and their dependencies are ignored.\n\nMore formal, choose such a set of projects of minimum possible size that the following conditions hold: \n -  Polycarp's project is chosen; -  Polycarp's project depends (directly or indirectly) on all other projects in the set; -  no two projects share the name; -  for each project *x* that some other project in the set depends on we have either *x* or some *y* with other version and shorter chain to Polycarp's project chosen.

Karlsson was not going to be hungry any longer, so he decided to get some food in the house.\n\nKarlsson's gaze immediately fell on *n* wooden cupboards, standing in the kitchen. He immediately realized that these cupboards have hidden jam stocks. Karlsson began to fly greedily around the kitchen, opening and closing the cupboards' doors, grab and empty all the jars of jam that he could find.\n\nAnd now all jars of jam are empty, Karlsson has had enough and does not want to leave traces of his stay, so as not to let down his friend. Each of the cupboards has two doors: the left one and the right one. Karlsson remembers that when he rushed to the kitchen, all the cupboards' left doors were in the same position (open or closed), similarly, all the cupboards' right doors were in the same position (open or closed). Karlsson wants the doors to meet this condition as well by the time the family returns. Karlsson does not remember the position of all the left doors, also, he cannot remember the position of all the right doors. Therefore, it does not matter to him in what position will be all left or right doors. It is important to leave all the left doors in the same position, and all the right doors in the same position. For example, all the left doors may be closed, and all the right ones may be open.\n\nKarlsson needs one second to open or close a door of a cupboard.

In each cell of the grid, there is exactly one type of flowers.\n\nAccording to Mino, the numbers of connected components formed by each kind of flowers are $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ respectively. Two cells are considered in the same connected component if and only if a path exists between them that moves between cells sharing common edges and passes only through cells containing the same flowers.\n\nYou are to help Kanno depict such a grid of flowers, with $n$ and $m$ arbitrarily chosen under the constraints given below. It can be shown that at least one solution exists under the constraints of this problem.\n\nNote that you can choose arbitrary $n$ and $m$ under the constraints below, they are not given in the input.\nInput specification: The first and only line of input contains four space-separated integers $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ ($1 \\leq a, b, c, d \\leq 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the required number of connected components of Amaranths, Begonias, Centaureas and Dianthuses, respectively.. Output specification: In the first line, output two space-separated integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\leq n, m \\leq 50$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of rows and the number of columns in the grid respectively.\n\nThen output $n$ lines each consisting of $m$ consecutive English letters, representing one row of the grid. Each letter should be among 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D', representing Amaranths, Begonias, Centaureas and Dianthuses, respectively.\n\nIn case there are multiple solutions, print any.

Help him find what is the maximum grade he can get in no more than *t* seconds. Note, that he can choose to not use all *t* seconds. Moreover, he can even choose to not round the grade at all.\n\nIn this problem, classic rounding rules are used: while rounding number to the *n*-th digit one has to take a look at the digit *n*<=+<=1. If it is less than 5 than the *n*-th digit remain unchanged while all subsequent digits are replaced with 0. Otherwise, if the *n*<=+<=1 digit is greater or equal to 5, the digit at the position *n* is increased by 1 (this might also change some other digits, if this one was equal to 9) and all subsequent digits are replaced with 0.

Write a python script for the following problem: Imagine that you have a twin brother or sister. Having another person that looks exactly like you seems very unusual. It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.\n\nNow let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins. The second line contains a sequence of *n* integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the coins' values. All numbers are separated with spaces.. Output specification: In the single line print the single number \u2014 the minimum needed number of coins.\nDemo input: ['2\\n3 3\\n', '3\\n2 1 2\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: In the first sample you will have to take 2 coins (you and your twin have sums equal to 6,\u20090 correspondingly). If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too. You can pick coins with values 1,\u20092 or 2,\u20092. In any case, the minimum number of coins equals 2."}]}}

The inhabited planets may be considered fixed points in it, and no two points coincide and no three points lie on the same straight line.

Thus, the process of spreading the important news around the galaxy continues.\n\nHowever the hyperdrive creators hurried to spread the news about their invention so much that they didn't study completely what goes on when two ships collide in the hyperspace.

Write a python script for the following problem: Merge sort is a well-known sorting algorithm. The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:\n 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=\u2264<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* \u2014 *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\nInput specification: The first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it..

The system adds *t**j* tokens to the bag. 1.  Finally, the system takes a uniformly random token from the bag and a player starts the level represented by the token. A player spends one hour and beats the level, even if he has already beaten it in the past. \nGiven *n*, *k* and values *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n*, your task is to split levels into regions.

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the elements of array. \n\nThe third line contains integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs. Separate the numbers by spaces.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nDemo input: ['2\\n1 2\\n1\\n1\\n', '2\\n2 1\\n1\\n1\\n', '3\\n3 1 2\\n3\\n1 2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['1 2\\n', '2 1\\n', '6 6\\n']\nNote: In the first sample Vasya's approach will make one comparison (it starts with the 1-st element and immediately finds the required number), and Petya's approach makes two comparisons (first he compares with the 2-nd array element, doesn't find the search item and compares with the 1-st element).\n\nIn the second sample, on the contrary, Vasya's approach will need two comparisons (first with 1-st element, and then with the 2-nd), and Petya's approach will find the required value in one comparison (the first comparison with the 2-nd element)."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Brothers Fred and George Weasley once got into the sporting goods store and opened a box of Quidditch balls. After long and painful experiments they found out that the Golden Snitch is not enchanted at all. It is simply a programmed device. It always moves along the same trajectory, which is a polyline with vertices at the points (*x*0,<=*y*0,<=*z*0), (*x*1,<=*y*1,<=*z*1), ..., (*x**n*,<=*y**n*,<=*z**n*). At the beginning of the game the snitch is positioned at the point (*x*0,<=*y*0,<=*z*0), and then moves along the polyline at the constant speed *v**s*. The twins have not yet found out how the snitch behaves then. Nevertheless, they hope that the retrieved information will help Harry Potter and his team in the upcoming match against Slytherin. Harry Potter learned that at the beginning the game he will be at the point (*P**x*,<=*P**y*,<=*P**z*) and his super fast Nimbus 2011 broom allows him to move at the constant speed *v**p* in any direction or remain idle. *v**p* is not less than the speed of the snitch *v**s*. Harry Potter, of course, wants to catch the snitch as soon as possible. Or, if catching the snitch while it is moving along the polyline is impossible, he wants to hurry the Weasley brothers with their experiments. Harry Potter catches the snitch at the time when they are at the same point. Help Harry.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=10000).

Write a python script for the following problem: Ahmed and Mostafa used to compete together in many programming contests for several years. Their coach Fegla asked them to solve one challenging problem, of course Ahmed was able to solve it but Mostafa couldn't.\n\nThis problem is similar to a standard problem but it has a different format and constraints.\n\nIn the standard problem you are given an array of integers, and you have to find one or more consecutive elements in this array where their sum is the maximum possible sum.\n\nBut in this problem you are given *n* small arrays, and you will create one big array from the concatenation of one or more instances of the small arrays (each small array could occur more than once). The big array will be given as an array of indexes (1-based) of the small arrays, and the concatenation should be done in the same order as in this array. Then you should apply the standard problem mentioned above on the resulting big array.\n\nFor example let's suppose that the small arrays are {1, 6, -2}, {3, 3} and {-5, 1}. And the indexes in the big array are {2, 3, 1, 3}. So the actual values in the big array after formatting it as concatenation of the small arrays will be {3, 3, -5, 1, 1, 6, -2, -5, 1}. In this example the maximum sum is 9.\n\nCan you help Mostafa solve this problem?\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m*, *n* is the number of the small arrays (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50), and *m* is the number of indexes in the big array (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=250000). Then follow *n* lines, the *i*-th line starts with one integer *l* which is the size of the *i*-th array (1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=5000), followed by *l* integers each one will be greater than or equal -1000 and less than or equal 1000. The last line contains *m* integers which are the indexes in the big array, and you should concatenate the small arrays in the same order, and each index will be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to *n*.\n\nThe small arrays are numbered from 1 to *n* in the same order as given in the input. Some of the given small arrays may not be used in big array.\n\nNote, that the array is very big. So if you try to build it straightforwardly, you will probably get time or/and memory limit exceeded..

Situation will be 7,\u20096,\u20096,\u20096.\n\nIn the third sample Limak is a winner without bribing any citizen."}]}}

Will the equation remain correct after removing all zeros?\n\nFor example if the equation is 101<=+<=102<==<=203, if we removed all zeros it will be 11<=+<=12<==<=23 which is still a correct equation.\n\nBut if the equation is 105<=+<=106<==<=211, if we removed all zeros it will be 15<=+<=16<==<=211 which is not a correct equation.\nInput specification: The input will consist of two lines, the first line will contain the integer *a*, and the second line will contain the integer *b* which are in the equation as described above (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=109). There won't be any leading zeros in both. The value of *c* should be calculated as *c*<==<=*a*<=+<=*b*..

At each stage the loser of each pair is eliminated (there are no draws). Such stages are held while the number of teams is even. 1.  Eventually there will be an odd number of teams remaining. If there is one team remaining, it will be declared the winner, and the tournament ends. Otherwise each of the remaining teams will play with each other remaining team once in round robin tournament (if there are *x* teams, there will be  games), and the tournament ends. \nFor example, if there were 20 teams initially, they would begin by playing 10 games. So, 10 teams would be eliminated, and the remaining 10 would play 5 games. Then the remaining 5 teams would play 10 games in a round robin tournament. In total there would be 10+5+10=25 games.\n\nDaniel has already booked the stadium for *n* games. Help him to determine how many teams he should invite so that the tournament needs exactly *n* games.

In addition, in the library you can take any of the collected works of Berland leaders, the library has a reading room.\n\nToday was the pilot launch of an automated reading room visitors' accounting system! The scanner of the system is installed at the entrance to the reading room. It records the events of the form \"reader entered room\", \"reader left room\". Every reader is assigned a registration number during the registration procedure at the library \u2014 it's a unique integer from 1 to 106. Thus, the system logs events of two forms:\n -  \"+ *r**i*\" \u2014 the reader with registration number *r**i* entered the room; -  \"- *r**i*\" \u2014 the reader with registration number *r**i* left the room. \nThe first launch of the system was a success, it functioned for some period of time, and, at the time of its launch and at the time of its shutdown, the reading room may already have visitors.\n\nSignificant funds of the budget of Berland have been spent on the design and installation of the system. Therefore, some of the citizens of the capital now demand to explain the need for this system and the benefits that its implementation will bring. Now, the developers of the system need to urgently come up with reasons for its existence.\n\nHelp the system developers to find the minimum possible capacity of the reading room (in visitors) using the log of the system available to you.\nInput specification: The first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of records in the system log.

For example, if *n*<==<=3, Sherlock's card is 123 and Moriarty's card has number 321, first Sherlock names 1 and Moriarty names 3 so Sherlock gets a flick. Then they both digit 2 so no one gets a flick. Finally, Sherlock names 3, while Moriarty names 1 and gets a flick.\n\nOf course, Sherlock will play honestly naming digits one by one in the order they are given, while Moriary, as a true villain, plans to cheat. He is going to name his digits in some other order (however, he is not going to change the overall number of occurences of each digit). For example, in case above Moriarty could name 1, 2, 3 and get no flicks at all, or he can name 2, 3 and 1 to give Sherlock two flicks.\n\nYour goal is to find out the minimum possible number of flicks Moriarty will get (no one likes flicks) and the maximum possible number of flicks Sherlock can get from Moriarty. Note, that these two goals are different and the optimal result may be obtained by using different strategies.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of digits in the cards Sherlock and Moriarty are going to use.\n\nThe second line contains *n* digits\u00a0\u2014 Sherlock's credit card number.\n\nThe third line contains *n* digits\u00a0\u2014 Moriarty's credit card number.. Output specification: First print the minimum possible number of flicks Moriarty will get. Then print the maximum possible number of flicks that Sherlock can get from Moriarty.\nDemo input: ['3\\n123\\n321\\n', '2\\n88\\n00\\n'], Demo output: ['0\\n2\\n', '2\\n0\\n']\nNote: First sample is elaborated in the problem statement. In the second sample, there is no way Moriarty can avoid getting two flicks."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: The \"Bulls and Cows\" game needs two people to play. The thinker thinks of a number and the guesser tries to guess it.\n\nThe thinker thinks of a four-digit number in the decimal system. All the digits in the number are different and the number may have a leading zero. It can't have more than one leading zero, because all it's digits should be different. The guesser tries to guess the number. He makes a series of guesses, trying experimental numbers and receives answers from the first person in the format \"*x* bulls *y* cows\". *x* represents the number of digits in the experimental number that occupy the same positions as in the sought number. *y* represents the number of digits of the experimental number that present in the sought number, but occupy different positions. Naturally, the experimental numbers, as well as the sought number, are represented by four-digit numbers where all digits are different and a leading zero can be present.\n\nFor example, let's suppose that the thinker thought of the number 0123. Then the guessers' experimental number 1263 will receive a reply \"1 bull 2 cows\" (3 occupies the same positions in both numbers and 1 and 2 are present in both numbers but they occupy different positions). Also, the answer to number 8103 will be \"2 bulls 1 cow\" (analogically, 1 and 3 occupy the same positions and 0 occupies a different one). \n\nWhen the guesser is answered \"4 bulls 0 cows\", the game is over.\n\nNow the guesser has already made several guesses and wants to know whether his next guess can possibly be the last one.\nInput specification: The first input line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=10) which represents the number of already made guesses. Then follow *n* lines in the form of \"*a**i* *b**i* *c**i*\", where *a**i* is the *i*-th experimental number, *b**i* is the number of bulls, *c**i* is the number of cows (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*, 0<=\u2264<=*b**i*,<=*c**i*,<=*b**i*<=+<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=4). The experimental numbers are correct, i.e., each of them contains exactly four digits, in each of them all the four digits are different, and there can be a leading zero. All the experimental numbers are different. As the guesser hasn't guessed the number yet, the answer \"4 bulls 0 cows\" is not present.. Output specification: If the input data is enough to determine the sought number, print the number with four digits on a single line. If it has less than four digits, add leading zero.

Write a python script for the following problem: *T* is a complete binary tree consisting of *n* vertices. It means that exactly one vertex is a root, and each vertex is either a leaf (and doesn't have children) or an inner node (and has exactly two children). All leaves of a complete binary tree have the same depth (distance from the root). So *n* is a number such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nIn the picture you can see a complete binary tree with *n*<==<=15.\n\nVertices are numbered from 1 to *n* in a special recursive way: we recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the left subtree (if current vertex is not a leaf), then assign a number to the current vertex, and then recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the right subtree (if it exists). In the picture vertices are numbered exactly using this algorithm. It is clear that for each size of a complete binary tree exists exactly one way to give numbers to all vertices. This way of numbering is called symmetric.\n\nYou have to write a program that for given *n* answers *q* queries to the tree.\n\nEach query consists of an integer number *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) and a string *s**i*, where *u**i* is the number of vertex, and *s**i* represents the path starting from this vertex. String *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U', which mean traverse to the left child, to the right child and to the parent, respectively. Characters from *s**i* have to be processed from left to right, considering that *u**i* is the vertex where the path starts. If it's impossible to process a character (for example, to go to the left child of a leaf), then you have to skip it. The answer is the number of vertex where the path represented by *s**i* ends.\n\nFor example, if *u**i*<==<=4 and *s**i*<==<=\u00abUURL\u00bb, then the answer is 10.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integer numbers *n* and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1018, *q*<=\u2265<=1). *n* is such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nThe next 2*q* lines represent queries; each query consists of two consecutive lines. The first of these two lines contains *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*), the second contains non-empty string *s**i*. *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of *s**i* (for each *i* such that 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*q*) doesn't exceed 105..

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$..

Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$."}]}}

As Greg removes a vertex, he also removes all the edges that go in and out of this vertex. -  Before executing each step, Greg wants to know the sum of lengths of the shortest paths between all pairs of the remaining vertices. The shortest path can go through any remaining vertex. In other words, if we assume that *d*(*i*,<=*v*,<=*u*) is the shortest path between vertices *v* and *u* in the graph that formed before deleting vertex *x**i*, then Greg wants to know the value of the following sum: . \nHelp Greg, print the value of the required sum before each step.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=500) \u2014 the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nNext *n* lines contain *n* integers each \u2014 the graph adjacency matrix: the *j*-th number in the *i*-th line *a**ij* (1<=\u2264<=*a**ij*<=\u2264<=105,<=*a**ii*<==<=0) represents the weight of the edge that goes from vertex *i* to vertex *j*.\n\nThe next line contains *n* distinct integers: *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n* (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the vertices that Greg deletes..

Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any *f* days from *n* next for sell-outs. On each of *f* chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on *i*-th day shop planned to put up for sale *k**i* products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7*k**i* products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.\n\nNoora's task is to choose *f* days to maximize total number of sold products.

Specifically, the square plane contains *n* bombs, the *i*-th bomb is at point with coordinates (*x**i*,<=*y**i*). We know that no two bombs are at the same point and that no bomb is at point with coordinates (0,<=0). Initially, the robot is at point with coordinates (0,<=0). Also, let's mark the robot's current position as (*x*,<=*y*). In order to destroy all the bombs, the robot can perform three types of operations:\n 1.  Operation has format \"1 k dir\". To perform the operation robot have to move in direction *dir* *k* (*k*<=\u2265<=1) times. There are only 4 directions the robot can move in: \"R\", \"L\", \"U\", \"D\". During one move the robot can move from the current point to one of following points: (*x*<=+<=1,<=*y*), (*x*<=-<=1,<=*y*), (*x*,<=*y*<=+<=1), (*x*,<=*y*<=-<=1) (corresponding to directions). It is forbidden to move from point (*x*,<=*y*), if at least one point on the path (besides the destination point) contains a bomb. 1.  Operation has format \"2\". To perform the operation robot have to pick a bomb at point (*x*,<=*y*) and put it in a special container. Thus, the robot can carry the bomb from any point to any other point. The operation cannot be performed if point (*x*,<=*y*) has no bomb. It is forbidden to pick a bomb if the robot already has a bomb in its container. 1.  Operation has format \"3\". To perform the operation robot have to take a bomb out of the container and destroy it. You are allowed to perform this operation only if the robot is at point (0,<=0).

Write a python script for the following problem: A famous Berland's painter Kalevitch likes to shock the public. One of his last obsessions is chess. For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards.\n\nAs before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8<=\u00d7<=8 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke.\n\nKalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client's requirements.\n\nIt goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything \u2014 for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's needs. You are asked to help Kalevitch with this task.\nInput specification: The input file contains 8 lines, each of the lines contains 8 characters.

For example, the Hamming distance between words \"permanent\" and \"pergament\" is two, as these words differ in the fourth and sixth letters.\n\nMoreover, as he was searching for information, he also noticed that modern search engines have powerful mechanisms to correct errors in the request to improve the quality of search.

Write a python script for the following problem: Merge sort is a well-known sorting algorithm. The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:\n 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=\u2264<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* \u2014 *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\nInput specification: The first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it.. Output specification: If a permutation of size *n* such that there will be exactly *k* calls of *mergesort* while sorting it doesn't exist, output <=-<=1. Otherwise output *n* integer numbers *a*[0],<=*a*[1],<=...,<=*a*[*n*<=-<=1] \u2014 the elements of a permutation that would meet the required conditions. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['3 3\\n', '4 1\\n', '5 6\\n'], Demo output: ['2 1 3 ', '1 2 3 4 ', '-1\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Recently Billy studied the concept of a digital root of a number. We should remind you that a digital root *d*(*x*) of the number *x* is the sum *s*(*x*) of all the digits of this number, if *s*(*x*)<=\u2264<=9, otherwise it is *d*(*s*(*x*)).

Billy has counted that the digital root of a product of numbers is equal to the digital root of the product of the factors' digital roots, i.e. *d*(*xy*)<==<=*d*(*d*(*x*)*d*(*y*)). And the following solution to the problem came to his mind: to calculate the digital roots and check if this condition is met. However, Billy has doubts that this condition is sufficient.

Write a python script for the following problem: It's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.\n\nRecently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.\n\nBeing defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.\n\nEach door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number *a*. The second part is either an integer number *b* or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer *c* and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.\n\n*c* is an integer written in base *a*, to open the door we should write it in base *b*. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!\n\nHere's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:\n\nRoman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.:\n-  I=1-  V=5-  X=10-  L=50-  C=100-  D=500-  M=1000\nSymbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1,<=000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.\n\nAlso in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\n\nHelp Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *a* and *b* (2<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=25). Only *b* may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer *c* in base *a* which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. \n\nIt is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.. Output specification: Write a single line that contains integer *c* in base *b*. You must omit leading zeros.\nDemo input: ['10 2\\n1\\n', '16 R\\n5\\n', '5 R\\n4\\n', '2 2\\n1111001\\n', '12 13\\nA\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', 'V\\n', 'IV\\n', '1111001\\n', 'A\\n']\nNote: You can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"}]}}

The qualification *q**j* of each employee is known, and for each application the following is true: *q**a**i*<=&gt;<=*q**b**i*. \n\nWould you help Nick calculate the minimum cost of such a hierarchy, or find out that it is impossible to build it.\nInput specification: The first input line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 amount of employees in the company. The following line contains *n* space-separated numbers *q**j* (0<=\u2264<=*q**j*<=\u2264<=106)\u2014 the employees' qualifications. The following line contains number *m* (0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=10000) \u2014 amount of received applications. The following *m* lines contain the applications themselves, each of them in the form of three space-separated numbers: *a**i*, *b**i* and *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, 0<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=106). Different applications can be similar, i.e. they can come from one and the same employee who offered to become a supervisor of the same person but at a different cost. For each application *q**a**i*<=&gt;<=*q**b**i*.. Output specification: Output the only line \u2014 the minimum cost of building such a hierarchy, or -1 if it is impossible to build it.\nDemo input: ['4\\n7 2 3 1\\n4\\n1 2 5\\n2 4 1\\n3 4 1\\n1 3 5\\n', '3\\n1 2 3\\n2\\n3 1 2\\n3 1 3\\n'], Demo output: ['11\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: In the first sample one of the possible ways for building a hierarchy is to take applications with indexes 1, 2 and 4, which give 11 as the minimum total cost. In the second sample it is impossible to build the required hierarchy, so the answer is -1."}]}}

He gathered the best of wise men, and sent an expedition to faraway countries, so that they would find out all about how a language should be designed.\n\nAfter some time, the wise men returned from the trip even wiser. They locked up for six months in the dining room, after which they said to the king: \"there are a lot of different languages, but almost all of them have letters that are divided into vowels and consonants; in a word, vowels and consonants must be combined correctly.\"\n\nThere are very many rules, all of them have exceptions, but our language will be deprived of such defects! We propose to introduce a set of formal rules of combining vowels and consonants, and include in the language all the words that satisfy them.\n\nThe rules of composing words are:\n-  The letters are divided into vowels and consonants in some certain way;-  All words have a length of exactly *n*;-  There are *m* rules of the form (*pos*1,<=*t*1,<=*pos*2,<=*t*2).

The length of this string *l* is the size of the alphabet of the new language (1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=26). The first *l* letters of the English alphabet are used as the letters of the alphabet of the new language.

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya.

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes.

So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091). He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: You're a mikemon breeder currently in the middle of your journey to become a mikemon master. Your current obstacle is go through the infamous Biridian Forest.\n\nThe forest\n\nThe Biridian Forest is a two-dimensional grid consisting of *r* rows and *c* columns. Each cell in Biridian Forest may contain a tree, or may be vacant. A vacant cell may be occupied by zero or more mikemon breeders (there may also be breeders other than you in the forest). Mikemon breeders (including you) cannot enter cells with trees. One of the cells is designated as the exit cell.\n\nThe initial grid, including your initial position, the exit cell, and the initial positions of all other breeders, will be given to you. Here's an example of such grid (from the first example):\n\nMoves\n\nBreeders (including you) may move in the forest. In a single move, breeders may perform one of the following actions: \n -  Do nothing. -  Move from the current cell to one of the four adjacent cells (two cells are adjacent if they share a side). Note that breeders cannot enter cells with trees. -  If you are located on the exit cell, you may leave the forest. Only you can perform this move \u2014 all other mikemon breeders will never leave the forest by using this type of movement. \nAfter each time you make a single move, each of the other breeders simultaneously make a single move (the choice of which move to make may be different for each of the breeders).\n\nMikemon battle\n\nIf you and *t* (*t*<=&gt;<=0) mikemon breeders are located on the same cell, exactly *t* mikemon battles will ensue that time (since you will be battling each of those *t* breeders once). After the battle, all of those *t* breeders will leave the forest to heal their respective mikemons.\n\nNote that the moment you leave the forest, no more mikemon battles can ensue, even if another mikemon breeder move to the exit cell immediately after that. Also note that a battle only happens between you and another breeders \u2014 there will be no battle between two other breeders (there may be multiple breeders coexisting in a single cell).\n\nYour goal\n\nYou would like to leave the forest. In order to do so, you have to make a sequence of moves, ending with a move of the final type. Before you make any move, however, you post this sequence on your personal virtual idol Blog. Then, you will follow this sequence of moves faithfully.\n\nGoal of other breeders\n\nBecause you post the sequence in your Blog, the other breeders will all know your exact sequence of moves even before you make your first move. All of them will move in such way that will guarantee a mikemon battle with you, if possible. The breeders that couldn't battle you will do nothing.\n\nYour task\n\nPrint the minimum number of mikemon battles that you must participate in, assuming that you pick the sequence of moves that minimize this number. Note that you are not required to minimize the number of moves you make.\nInput specification: The first line consists of two integers: *r* and *c* (1<=\u2264<=*r*,<=*c*<=\u2264<=1000), denoting the number of rows and the number of columns in Biridian Forest. The next *r* rows will each depict a row of the map, where each character represents the content of a single cell: \n -  'T': A cell occupied by a tree. -  'S': An empty cell, and your starting position. There will be exactly one occurence of this in the map. -  'E': An empty cell, and where the exit is located. There will be exactly one occurence of this in the map. -  A digit (0-9): A cell represented by a digit X means that the cell is empty and is occupied by X breeders (in particular, if X is zero, it means that the cell is not occupied by any breeder). \nIt is guaranteed that it will be possible for you to go from your starting position to the exit cell through a sequence of moves.. Output specification: A single line denoted the minimum possible number of mikemon battles that you have to participate in if you pick a strategy that minimize this number.\nDemo input: ['5 7\\n000E0T3\\nT0TT0T0\\n010T0T0\\n2T0T0T0\\n0T0S000\\n', '1 4\\nSE23\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: The following picture illustrates the first example. The blue line denotes a possible sequence of moves that you should post in your blog:\n\nThe three breeders on the left side of the map will be able to battle you \u2014 the lone breeder can simply stay in his place until you come while the other two breeders can move to where the lone breeder is and stay there until you come. The three breeders on the right does not have a way to battle you, so they will stay in their place.\n\nFor the second example, you should post this sequence in your Blog:\n\nHere's what happens. First, you move one cell to the right.\n\nThen, the two breeders directly to the right of the exit will simultaneously move to the left. The other three breeder cannot battle you so they will do nothing.\n\nYou end up in the same cell with 2 breeders, so 2 mikemon battles are conducted. After those battles, all of your opponents leave the forest.\n\nFinally, you make another move by leaving the forest."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: First-rate specialists graduate from Berland State Institute of Peace and Friendship. You are one of the most talented students in this university. The education is not easy because you need to have fundamental knowledge in different areas, which sometimes are not related to each other. \n\nFor example, you should know linguistics very well. You learn a structure of Reberland language as foreign language. In this language words are constructed according to the following rules. First you need to choose the \"root\" of the word \u2014 some string which has more than 4 letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3 symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction \u2014  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row. All these strings are considered to be suffixes of the word (this time we use word \"suffix\" to describe a morpheme but not the few last characters of the string as you may used to). \n\nHere is one exercise that you have found in your task list. You are given the word *s*. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language. \n\nTwo strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match. \n\nLet's look at the example: the word *abacabaca* is given. This word can be obtained in the following ways: , where the root of the word is overlined, and suffixes are marked by \"corners\". Thus, the set of possible suffixes for this word is {*aca*,<=*ba*,<=*ca*}.\nInput specification: The only line contains a string *s* (5<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=104) consisting of lowercase English letters.. Output specification: On the first line print integer *k* \u2014 a number of distinct possible suffixes. On the next *k* lines print suffixes. \n\nPrint suffixes in lexicographical (alphabetical) order.\nDemo input: ['abacabaca\\n', 'abaca\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\naca\\nba\\nca\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: The first test was analysed in the problem statement. \n\nIn the second example the length of the string equals 5. The length of the root equals 5, so no string can be used as a suffix."}]}}

He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: The heat during the last few days has been really intense. Scientists from all over the Berland study how the temperatures and weather change, and they claim that this summer is abnormally hot. But any scientific claim sounds a lot more reasonable if there are some numbers involved, so they have decided to actually calculate some value which would represent how high the temperatures are.\n\nMathematicians of Berland State University came up with a special heat intensity value. This value is calculated as follows:\n\nSuppose we want to analyze the segment of $n$ consecutive days. We have measured the temperatures during these $n$ days; the temperature during $i$-th day equals $a_i$.\n\nWe denote the average temperature of a segment of some consecutive days as the arithmetic mean of the temperature measures during this segment of days. So, if we want to analyze the average temperature from day $x$ to day $y$, we calculate it as $\\frac{\\sum \\limits_{i = x}^{y} a_i}{y - x + 1}$ (note that division is performed without any rounding). The heat intensity value is the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than $k$ consecutive days. For example, if analyzing the measures $[3, 4, 1, 2]$ and $k = 3$, we are interested in segments $[3, 4, 1]$, $[4, 1, 2]$ and $[3, 4, 1, 2]$ (we want to find the maximum value of average temperature over these segments).\n\nYou have been hired by Berland State University to write a program that would compute the heat intensity value of a given period of days. Are you up to this task?\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n \\le 5000$) \u2014 the number of days in the given period, and the minimum number of days in a segment we consider when calculating heat intensity value, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 5000$) \u2014 the temperature measures during given $n$ days.. Output specification: Print one real number \u2014 the heat intensity value, i. e., the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than $k$ consecutive days.\n\nYour answer will be considered correct if the following condition holds: $|res - res_0| &lt; 10^{-6}$, where $res$ is your answer, and $res_0$ is the answer given by the jury's solution.\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n3 4 1 2\\n'], Demo output: ['2.666666666666667\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Bob is a farmer. He has a large pasture with many sheep. Recently, he has lost some of them due to wolf attacks. He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of dogs.\nDemo input: ['6 6\\n..S...\\n..S.W.\\n.S....\\n..W...\\n...W..\\n......\\n', '1 2\\nSW\\n', '5 5\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS....\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n..SD..\\n..SDW.\\n.SD...\\n.DW...\\nDD.W..\\n......\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS.D..\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n']\nNote: In the first example, we can split the pasture into two halves, one containing wolves and one containing sheep. Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Kevin Sun has just finished competing in Codeforces Round #334! The round was 120 minutes long and featured five problems with maximum point values of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500, respectively. Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.\n\nCodeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is *x*, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute *m* but made *w* wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is . His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.\n\nAll arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains five space-separated integers *m*1, *m*2, *m*3, *m*4, *m*5, where *m**i* (0<=\u2264<=*m**i*<=\u2264<=119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem *i*. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted.\n\nThe second line contains five space-separated integers *w*1, *w*2, *w*3, *w*4, *w*5, where *w**i* (0<=\u2264<=*w**i*<=\u2264<=10) is Kevin's number of wrong submissions on problem *i*.\n\nThe last line contains two space-separated integers *h**s* and *h**u* (0<=\u2264<=*h**s*,<=*h**u*<=\u2264<=20), denoting the Kevin's numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively..

Adding in 10\u00b7100\u2009=\u20091000 points from hacks, his total score becomes 3930\u2009+\u20091000\u2009=\u20094930."}]}}

Remind that a geometric progression is a sequence of integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=*b*3,<=..., where for each *i*<=&gt;<=1 the respective term satisfies the condition *b**i*<==<=*b**i*<=-<=1\u00b7*q*, where *q* is called the common ratio of the progression. Progressions in Uzhlyandia are unusual: both *b*1 and *q* can equal 0. Also, Dvastan gave Masha *m* \"bad\" integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**m*, and an integer *l*.\n\nMasha writes all progression terms one by one onto the board (including repetitive) while condition |*b**i*|<=\u2264<=*l* is satisfied (|*x*| means absolute value of *x*). There is an exception: if a term equals one of the \"bad\" integers, Masha skips it (doesn't write onto the board) and moves forward to the next term.\n\nBut the lesson is going to end soon, so Masha has to calculate how many integers will be written on the board. In order not to get into depression, Masha asked you for help: help her calculate how many numbers she will write, or print \"inf\" in case she needs to write infinitely many integers.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains four integers *b*1, *q*, *l*, *m* (-109<=\u2264<=*b*1,<=*q*<=\u2264<=109, 1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=109, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the initial term and the common ratio of progression, absolute value of maximal number that can be written on the board and the number of \"bad\" integers, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains *m* distinct integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**m* (-109<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 numbers that will never be written on the board.. Output specification: Print the only integer, meaning the number of progression terms that will be written on the board if it is finite, or \"inf\" (without quotes) otherwise.\nDemo input: ['3 2 30 4\\n6 14 25 48\\n', '123 1 2143435 4\\n123 11 -5453 141245\\n', '123 1 2143435 4\\n54343 -13 6 124\\n'], Demo output: ['3', '0', 'inf']\nNote: In the first sample case, Masha will write integers 3,\u200912,\u200924. Progression term 6 will be skipped because it is a \"bad\" integer. Terms bigger than 24 won't be written because they exceed *l* by absolute value.\n\nIn the second case, Masha won't write any number because all terms are equal 123 and this is a \"bad\" integer.\n\nIn the third case, Masha will write infinitely integers 123."}]}}

The numbers in the lines are separated by spaces.. Output specification: For each trolleybus print a single line the time it arrives to the final station. Print the times for the trolleybuses in the order in which the trolleybuses are given in the input.

The trolleybuses will go the remaining 9489.5 meters together at speed 10 meters per second. As a result, both trolleybuses will arrive to the final station by the moment of time 1000.5 seconds. The third trolleybus will not catch up with them. It will arrive to the final station by the moment of time 11000.05 seconds."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Petya has recently learned data structure named \"Binary heap\".\n\nThe heap he is now operating with allows the following operations: \n -  put the given number into the heap; -  get the value of the minimum element in the heap; -  extract the minimum element from the heap; \nThus, at any moment of time the heap contains several integers (possibly none), some of them might be equal.\n\nIn order to better learn this data structure Petya took an empty heap and applied some operations above to it. Also, he carefully wrote down all the operations and their results to his event log, following the format: \n -  insert *x*\u00a0\u2014 put the element with value *x* in the heap; -  getMin *x*\u00a0\u2014 the value of the minimum element contained in the heap was equal to *x*; -  removeMin\u00a0\u2014 the minimum element was extracted from the heap (only one instance, if there were many). \nAll the operations were correct, i.e. there was at least one element in the heap each time getMin or removeMin operations were applied.\n\nWhile Petya was away for a lunch, his little brother Vova came to the room, took away some of the pages from Petya's log and used them to make paper boats.\n\nNow Vova is worried, if he made Petya's sequence of operations inconsistent. For example, if one apply operations one-by-one in the order they are written in the event log, results of getMin operations might differ from the results recorded by Petya, and some of getMin or removeMin operations may be incorrect, as the heap is empty at the moment they are applied.\n\nNow Vova wants to add some new operation records to the event log in order to make the resulting sequence of operations correct. That is, the result of each getMin operation is equal to the result in the record, and the heap is non-empty when getMin ad removeMin are applied. Vova wants to complete this as fast as possible, as the Petya may get back at any moment. He asks you to add the least possible number of operation records to the current log. Note that arbitrary number of operations may be added at the beginning, between any two other operations, or at the end of the log.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains the only integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of the records left in Petya's journal.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines describe the records in the current log in the order they are applied. Format described in the statement is used. All numbers in the input are integers not exceeding 109 by their absolute value.. Output specification: The first line of the output should contain a single integer *m*\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible number of records in the modified sequence of operations.\n\nNext *m* lines should contain the corrected sequence of records following the format of the input (described in the statement), one per line and in the order they are applied. All the numbers in the output should be integers not exceeding 109 by their absolute value.\n\nNote that the input sequence of operations must be the subsequence of the output sequence.\n\nIt's guaranteed that there exists the correct answer consisting of no more than 1<=000<=000 operations.\nDemo input: ['2\\ninsert 3\\ngetMin 4\\n', '4\\ninsert 1\\ninsert 1\\nremoveMin\\ngetMin 2\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\ninsert 3\\nremoveMin\\ninsert 4\\ngetMin 4\\n', '6\\ninsert 1\\ninsert 1\\nremoveMin\\nremoveMin\\ninsert 2\\ngetMin 2\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, after number 3 is inserted into the heap, the minimum number is 3. To make the result of the first getMin equal to 4 one should firstly remove number 3 from the heap and then add number 4 into the heap.\n\nIn the second sample case number 1 is inserted two times, so should be similarly removed twice."}]}}

But androids have to go to school to be able to solve creative tasks. Just like humans before.\n\nIt turns out that high school struggles are not gone. If someone is not like others, he is bullied. Vasya-8800 is an economy-class android which is produced by a little-known company. His design is not perfect, his characteristics also could be better. So he is bullied by other androids.\n\nOne of the popular pranks on Vasya is to force him to compare $x^y$ with $y^x$. Other androids can do it in milliseconds while Vasya's memory is too small to store such big numbers.\n\nPlease help Vasya! Write a fast program to compare $x^y$ with $y^x$ for Vasya, maybe then other androids will respect him.\nInput specification: On the only line of input there are two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1 \\le x, y \\le 10^{9}$)..

Write a python script for the following problem: A Ministry for Defense sent a general to inspect the Super Secret Military Squad under the command of the Colonel SuperDuper. Having learned the news, the colonel ordered to all *n* squad soldiers to line up on the parade ground.\n\nBy the military charter the soldiers should stand in the order of non-increasing of their height. But as there's virtually no time to do that, the soldiers lined up in the arbitrary order. However, the general is rather short-sighted and he thinks that the soldiers lined up correctly if the first soldier in the line has the maximum height and the last soldier has the minimum height. Please note that the way other solders are positioned does not matter, including the case when there are several soldiers whose height is maximum or minimum. Only the heights of the first and the last soldier are important.\n\nFor example, the general considers the sequence of heights (4, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1) correct and the sequence (4, 3, 1, 2, 2) wrong.\n\nWithin one second the colonel can swap any two neighboring soldiers.

Then both players name the digits written on their cards one by one. If two digits are not equal, then the player, whose digit is smaller gets a flick (knock in the forehead usually made with a forefinger) from the other player. For example, if *n*<==<=3, Sherlock's card is 123 and Moriarty's card has number 321, first Sherlock names 1 and Moriarty names 3 so Sherlock gets a flick. Then they both digit 2 so no one gets a flick. Finally, Sherlock names 3, while Moriarty names 1 and gets a flick.\n\nOf course, Sherlock will play honestly naming digits one by one in the order they are given, while Moriary, as a true villain, plans to cheat. He is going to name his digits in some other order (however, he is not going to change the overall number of occurences of each digit).

Write a python script for the following problem: After the big birthday party, Katie still wanted Shiro to have some more fun. Later, she came up with a game called treasure hunt. Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\n\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.. Output specification: Print the name of the winner (\"Kuro\", \"Shiro\" or \"Katie\"). If there are at least two cats that share the maximum beauty, print \"Draw\".\nDemo input: ['3\\nKuroo\\nShiro\\nKatie\\n', '7\\ntreasurehunt\\nthreefriends\\nhiCodeforces\\n', '1\\nabcabc\\ncbabac\\nababca\\n', '15\\nfoPaErcvJ\\nmZaxowpbt\\nmkuOlaHRE\\n'], Demo output: ['Kuro\\n', 'Shiro\\n', 'Katie\\n', 'Draw\\n']\nNote: In the first example, after $3$ turns, Kuro can change his ribbon into ooooo, which has the beauty of $5$, while reaching such beauty for Shiro and Katie is impossible (both Shiro and Katie can reach the beauty of at most $4$, for example by changing Shiro's ribbon into SSiSS and changing Katie's ribbon into Kaaaa). Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice.

Write a python script for the following problem: Mad scientist Mike has just finished constructing a new device to search for extraterrestrial intelligence! He was in such a hurry to launch it for the first time that he plugged in the power wires without giving it a proper glance and started experimenting right away. After a while Mike observed that the wires ended up entangled and now have to be untangled again.\n\nThe device is powered by two wires \"plus\" and \"minus\". The wires run along the floor from the wall (on the left) to the device (on the right). Both the wall and the device have two contacts in them on the same level, into which the wires are plugged in some order. The wires are considered entangled if there are one or more places where one wire runs above the other one. For example, the picture below has four such places (top view):\n\nMike knows the sequence in which the wires run above each other. Mike also noticed that on the left side, the \"plus\" wire is always plugged into the top contact (as seen on the picture). He would like to untangle the wires without unplugging them and without moving the device. Determine if it is possible to do that. A wire can be freely moved and stretched on the floor, but cannot be cut.\n\nTo understand the problem better please read the notes to the test samples.\nInput specification: The single line of the input contains a sequence of characters \"+\" and \"-\" of length *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000). The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) position of the sequence contains the character \"+\", if on the *i*-th step from the wall the \"plus\" wire runs above the \"minus\" wire, and the character \"-\" otherwise.. Output specification: Print either \"Yes\" (without the quotes) if the wires can be untangled or \"No\" (without the quotes) if the wires cannot be untangled.\nDemo input: ['-++-\\n', '+-\\n', '++\\n', '-\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n', 'No\\n']\nNote: The first testcase corresponds to the picture in the statement. To untangle the wires, one can first move the \"plus\" wire lower, thus eliminating the two crosses in the middle, and then draw it under the \"minus\" wire, eliminating also the remaining two crosses.\n\nIn the second testcase the \"plus\" wire makes one full revolution around the \"minus\" wire. Thus the wires cannot be untangled: \n\nIn the third testcase the \"plus\" wire simply runs above the \"minus\" wire twice in sequence. The wires can be untangled by lifting \"plus\" and moving it higher: \n\nIn the fourth testcase the \"minus\" wire runs above the \"plus\" wire once. The wires cannot be untangled without moving the device itself:"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Natasha is going to fly to Mars. She needs to build a rocket, which consists of several stages in some order. Each of the stages is defined by a lowercase Latin letter. This way, the rocket can be described by the string\u00a0\u2014 concatenation of letters, which correspond to the stages.\n\nThere are $n$ stages available. The rocket must contain exactly $k$ of them. Stages in the rocket should be ordered by their weight. So, after the stage with some letter can go only stage with a letter, which is at least two positions after in the alphabet (skipping one letter in between, or even more). For example, after letter 'c' can't go letters 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd', but can go letters 'e', 'f', ..., 'z'.\n\nFor the rocket to fly as far as possible, its weight should be minimal. The weight of the rocket is equal to the sum of the weights of its stages. The weight of the stage is the number of its letter in the alphabet. For example, the stage 'a 'weighs one ton,' b 'weighs two tons, and' z'\u00a0\u2014 $26$ tons.\n\nBuild the rocket with the minimal weight or determine, that it is impossible to build a rocket at all.

Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little.

Therefore, some of the citizens of the capital now demand to explain the need for this system and the benefits that its implementation will bring. Now, the developers of the system need to urgently come up with reasons for its existence.\n\nHelp the system developers to find the minimum possible capacity of the reading room (in visitors) using the log of the system available to you.\nInput specification: The first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of records in the system log. Next follow *n* events from the system journal in the order in which the were made. Each event was written on a single line and looks as \"+ *r**i*\" or \"- *r**i*\", where *r**i* is an integer from 1 to 106, the registration number of the visitor (that is, distinct visitors always have distinct registration numbers).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the log is not contradictory, that is, for every visitor the types of any of his two consecutive events are distinct. Before starting the system, and after stopping the room may possibly contain visitors.. Output specification: Print a single integer \u2014 the minimum possible capacity of the reading room.\nDemo input: ['6\\n+ 12001\\n- 12001\\n- 1\\n- 1200\\n+ 1\\n+ 7\\n', '2\\n- 1\\n- 2\\n', '2\\n+ 1\\n- 1\\n'], Demo output: ['3', '2', '1']\nNote: In the first sample test, the system log will ensure that at some point in the reading room were visitors with registration numbers 1, 1200 and 12001. More people were not in the room at the same time based on the log. Therefore, the answer to the test is 3."}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.

The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs.

Specifically, the first jigsaw puzzle consists of *f*1 pieces, the second one consists of *f*2 pieces and so on.\n\nMs. Manana doesn't want to upset the children, so she decided that the difference between the numbers of pieces in her presents must be as small as possible.

Greg loves playing with the graph and now he has invented a new game:\n -  The game consists of *n* steps. -  On the *i*-th step Greg removes vertex number *x**i* from the graph. As Greg removes a vertex, he also removes all the edges that go in and out of this vertex. -  Before executing each step, Greg wants to know the sum of lengths of the shortest paths between all pairs of the remaining vertices. The shortest path can go through any remaining vertex. In other words, if we assume that *d*(*i*,<=*v*,<=*u*) is the shortest path between vertices *v* and *u* in the graph that formed before deleting vertex *x**i*, then Greg wants to know the value of the following sum: . \nHelp Greg, print the value of the required sum before each step.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=500) \u2014 the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nNext *n* lines contain *n* integers each \u2014 the graph adjacency matrix: the *j*-th number in the *i*-th line *a**ij* (1<=\u2264<=*a**ij*<=\u2264<=105,<=*a**ii*<==<=0) represents the weight of the edge that goes from vertex *i* to vertex *j*.\n\nThe next line contains *n* distinct integers: *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n* (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the vertices that Greg deletes..

Write a python script for the following problem: Manao works on a sports TV. He's spent much time watching the football games of some country. After a while he began to notice different patterns. For example, each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform and guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well. For each team the color of the home and guest uniform is different.\n\nThere are *n* teams taking part in the national championship. The championship consists of *n*\u00b7(*n*<=-<=1) games: each team invites each other team to its stadium. At this point Manao wondered: how many times during the championship is a host team going to put on the guest uniform? Note that the order of the games does not affect this number.\n\nYou know the colors of the home and guest uniform for each team.

Write a python script for the following problem: Arcady is a copywriter. His today's task is to type up an already well-designed story using his favorite text editor.\n\nArcady types words, punctuation signs and spaces one after another. Each letter and each sign (including line feed) requires one keyboard click in order to be printed. Moreover, when Arcady has a non-empty prefix of some word on the screen, the editor proposes a possible autocompletion for this word, more precisely one of the already printed words such that its prefix matches the currently printed prefix if this word is unique. For example, if Arcady has already printed \u00abcodeforces\u00bb, \u00abcoding\u00bb and \u00abcodeforces\u00bb once again, then there will be no autocompletion attempt for \u00abcod\u00bb, but if he proceeds with \u00abcode\u00bb, the editor will propose \u00abcodeforces\u00bb.\n\nWith a single click Arcady can follow the editor's proposal, i.e. to transform the current prefix to it. Note that no additional symbols are printed after the autocompletion (no spaces, line feeds, etc). What is the minimum number of keyboard clicks Arcady has to perform to print the entire text, if he is not allowed to move the cursor or erase the already printed symbols?\n\nA word here is a contiguous sequence of latin letters bordered by spaces, punctuation signs and line/text beginnings/ends.

Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.\n\nCodeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is *x*, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute *m* but made *w* wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is .

Write a python script for the following problem: Motorist Kojiro spent 10 years saving up for his favorite car brand, Furrari. Finally Kojiro's dream came true! Kojiro now wants to get to his girlfriend Johanna to show off his car to her.\n\nKojiro wants to get to his girlfriend, so he will go to her along a coordinate line. For simplicity, we can assume that Kojiro is at the point *f* of a coordinate line, and Johanna is at point *e*. Some points of the coordinate line have gas stations. Every gas station fills with only one type of fuel: Regular-92, Premium-95 or Super-98. Thus, each gas station is characterized by a pair of integers *t**i* and *x**i* \u2014 the number of the gas type and its position.\n\nOne liter of fuel is enough to drive for exactly 1 km (this value does not depend on the type of fuel). Fuels of three types differ only in quality, according to the research, that affects the lifetime of the vehicle motor. A Furrari tank holds exactly *s* liters of fuel (regardless of the type of fuel). At the moment of departure from point *f* Kojiro's tank is completely filled with fuel Super-98. At each gas station Kojiro can fill the tank with any amount of fuel, but of course, at no point in time, the amount of fuel in the tank can be more than *s* liters. Note that the tank can simultaneously have different types of fuel. The car can moves both left and right.\n\nTo extend the lifetime of the engine Kojiro seeks primarily to minimize the amount of fuel of type Regular-92. If there are several strategies to go from *f* to *e*, using the minimum amount of fuel of type Regular-92, it is necessary to travel so as to minimize the amount of used fuel of type Premium-95.\n\nWrite a program that can for the *m* possible positions of the start *f**i* minimize firstly, the amount of used fuel of type Regular-92 and secondly, the amount of used fuel of type Premium-95.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains four positive integers *e*,<=*s*,<=*n*,<=*m* (1<=\u2264<=*e*,<=*s*<=\u2264<=109,<=1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105) \u2014 the coordinate of the point where Johanna is, the capacity of a Furrari tank, the number of gas stations and the number of starting points. \n\nNext *n* lines contain two integers each *t**i*,<=*x**i* (1<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=3,<=<=-<=109<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=109), representing the type of the *i*-th gas station (1 represents Regular-92, 2 \u2014 Premium-95 and 3 \u2014 Super-98) and the position on a coordinate line of the *i*-th gas station. Gas stations don't necessarily follow in order from left to right.\n\nThe last line contains *m* integers *f**i* (<=-<=109<=\u2264<=*f**i*<=&lt;<=*e*).

Alexander has *n* friends, and each of them sends to Alexander exactly one e-card. Let us number his friends by numbers from 1 to *n* in the order in which they send the cards. Let's introduce the same numbering for the cards, that is, according to the numbering the *i*-th friend sent to Alexander a card number *i*.\n\nAlexander also sends cards to friends, but he doesn't look for the new cards on the Net. He simply uses the cards previously sent to him (sometimes, however, he does need to add some crucial details). Initially Alexander doesn't have any cards. Alexander always follows the two rules:\n 1.  He will never send to a firend a card that this friend has sent to him. 1.  Among the other cards available to him at the moment, Alexander always chooses one that Alexander himself likes most. \nAlexander plans to send to each friend exactly one card. Of course, Alexander can send the same card multiple times.\n\nAlexander and each his friend has the list of preferences, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*. The first number in the list is the number of the favorite card, the second number shows the second favorite, and so on, the last number shows the least favorite card.\n\nYour task is to find a schedule of sending cards for Alexander. Determine at which moments of time Alexander must send cards to his friends, to please each of them as much as possible. In other words, so that as a result of applying two Alexander's rules, each friend receives the card that is preferred for him as much as possible.\n\nNote that Alexander doesn't choose freely what card to send, but he always strictly follows the two rules.\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=300) \u2014 the number of Alexander's friends, equal to the number of cards. Next *n* lines contain his friends' preference lists. Each list consists of *n* different integers from 1 to *n*. The last line contains Alexander's preference list in the same format.. Output specification: Print *n* space-separated numbers: the *i*-th number should be the number of the friend, whose card Alexander receives right before he should send a card to the *i*-th friend.

Alexander receives card 1 from the first friend. 1.  Alexander sends the card he has received (at the moment he only has one card, and therefore it is the most preferable for him) to friends with the numbers 2 and 3. 1.  Alexander receives card 2 from the second friend, now he has two cards \u2014 1 and 2. 1.  Alexander sends a card to the first friend. Despite the fact that Alexander likes card 1 more, he sends card 2 as he cannot send a friend the card sent by that very friend. 1.  Alexander receives card 3 from the third friend. 1.  Alexander receives card 4 from the fourth friend. 1.  Among the cards Alexander has number 3 is his favorite and he sends it to the fourth friend. \nNote that Alexander can send cards to multiple friends at a time (in this case the second and the third one). Alexander can send card 3 to the fourth friend after he receives the third card or after he receives the fourth card (both variants are correct)."}]}}

Menshykov, Uslada and Horace decided to make either an elephant or a bear from those sticks. They can make an animal from sticks in the following way: \n -  Four sticks represent the animal's legs, these sticks should have the same length. -  Two remaining sticks represent the animal's head and body. The bear's head stick must be shorter than the body stick. The elephant, however, has a long trunk, so his head stick must be as long as the body stick.

At this stage Vasya's ninja should get out of a deep canyon.\n\nThe canyon consists of two vertical parallel walls, their height is *n* meters. Let's imagine that we split these walls into 1 meter-long areas and number them with positive integers from 1 to *n* from bottom to top. Some areas are safe and the ninja can climb them. Others are spiky and ninja can't be there. Let's call such areas dangerous.\n\nInitially the ninja is on the lower area of the left wall. He can use each second to perform one of the following actions: \n -  climb one area up; -  climb one area down; -  jump to the opposite wall. That gets the ninja to the area that is exactly *k* meters higher than the area he jumped from. More formally, if before the jump the ninja is located at area *x* of one wall, then after the jump he is located at area *x*<=+<=*k* of the other wall. \nIf at some point of time the ninja tries to get to an area with a number larger than *n*, then we can assume that the ninja got out of the canyon.\n\nThe canyon gets flooded and each second the water level raises one meter. Initially the water level is at the lower border of the first area. Ninja cannot be on the area covered by water. We can assume that the ninja and the water \"move in turns\" \u2014 first the ninja performs some action, then the water raises for one meter, then the ninja performs one more action and so on.\n\nThe level is considered completed if the ninja manages to get out of the canyon.\n\nAfter several failed attempts Vasya started to doubt whether it is possible to complete the level at all.

Thus the answer is 3.\n\nIn the second example we can notice that parity of first and second price is different and never changes within described process. Thus prices never can become equal.\n\nIn the third example following scenario can take place: firstly, the second price drops, then the third price, and then fourth price. It happens 999999999 times, and, since in one second only one price can drop, the whole process takes 999999999\u2009*\u20093\u2009=\u20092999999997 seconds.

Write a python script for the following problem: *T* is a complete binary tree consisting of *n* vertices. It means that exactly one vertex is a root, and each vertex is either a leaf (and doesn't have children) or an inner node (and has exactly two children). All leaves of a complete binary tree have the same depth (distance from the root). So *n* is a number such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nIn the picture you can see a complete binary tree with *n*<==<=15.\n\nVertices are numbered from 1 to *n* in a special recursive way: we recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the left subtree (if current vertex is not a leaf), then assign a number to the current vertex, and then recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the right subtree (if it exists). In the picture vertices are numbered exactly using this algorithm. It is clear that for each size of a complete binary tree exists exactly one way to give numbers to all vertices. This way of numbering is called symmetric.\n\nYou have to write a program that for given *n* answers *q* queries to the tree.\n\nEach query consists of an integer number *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) and a string *s**i*, where *u**i* is the number of vertex, and *s**i* represents the path starting from this vertex. String *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U', which mean traverse to the left child, to the right child and to the parent, respectively. Characters from *s**i* have to be processed from left to right, considering that *u**i* is the vertex where the path starts. If it's impossible to process a character (for example, to go to the left child of a leaf), then you have to skip it. The answer is the number of vertex where the path represented by *s**i* ends.\n\nFor example, if *u**i*<==<=4 and *s**i*<==<=\u00abUURL\u00bb, then the answer is 10.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integer numbers *n* and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1018, *q*<=\u2265<=1). *n* is such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nThe next 2*q* lines represent queries; each query consists of two consecutive lines.

Write a python script for the following problem: After the big birthday party, Katie still wanted Shiro to have some more fun. Later, she came up with a game called treasure hunt. Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\n\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.. Output specification: Print the name of the winner (\"Kuro\", \"Shiro\" or \"Katie\"). If there are at least two cats that share the maximum beauty, print \"Draw\".\nDemo input: ['3\\nKuroo\\nShiro\\nKatie\\n', '7\\ntreasurehunt\\nthreefriends\\nhiCodeforces\\n', '1\\nabcabc\\ncbabac\\nababca\\n', '15\\nfoPaErcvJ\\nmZaxowpbt\\nmkuOlaHRE\\n'], Demo output: ['Kuro\\n', 'Shiro\\n', 'Katie\\n', 'Draw\\n']\nNote: In the first example, after $3$ turns, Kuro can change his ribbon into ooooo, which has the beauty of $5$, while reaching such beauty for Shiro and Katie is impossible (both Shiro and Katie can reach the beauty of at most $4$, for example by changing Shiro's ribbon into SSiSS and changing Katie's ribbon into Kaaaa). Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice. Therefore, the game ends in a draw."}]}}

Kaiki provides another sequence *b*, whose length *k* equals the number of lost elements in *a* (i.e. the number of zeros). Hitagi is to replace each zero in *a* with an element from *b* so that each element in *b* should be used exactly once. Hitagi knows, however, that, apart from 0, no integer occurs in *a* and *b* more than once in total.\n\nIf the resulting sequence is not an increasing sequence, then it has the power to recover Hitagi from the oddity.

It's known that any two computers connected by cable directly or through other computers\n\nPolycarpus decided to find out the network's topology. A network topology is the way of describing the network configuration, the scheme that shows the location and the connections of network devices.\n\nPolycarpus knows three main network topologies: bus, ring and star. A bus is the topology that represents a shared cable with all computers connected with it. In the ring topology the cable connects each computer only with two other ones. A star is the topology where all computers of a network are connected to the single central node.\n\nLet's represent each of these network topologies as a connected non-directed graph. A bus is a connected graph that is the only path, that is, the graph where all nodes are connected with two other ones except for some two nodes that are the beginning and the end of the path. A ring is a connected graph, where all nodes are connected with two other ones. A star is a connected graph, where a single central node is singled out and connected with all other nodes. For clarifications, see the picture.\n\nYou've got a connected non-directed graph that characterizes the computer network in Polycarpus' corporation.

That is, words \"lios\", \"liala\", \"etr\" and so on belong to the Petya's language. -  There aren't any punctuation marks, grammatical tenses, singular/plural forms or other language complications. -  A sentence is either exactly one valid language word or exactly one statement. \nStatement is any sequence of the Petya's language, that satisfy both conditions:\n-  Words in statement follow in the following order (from the left to the right): zero or more adjectives followed by exactly one noun followed by zero or more verbs. -  All words in the statement should have the same gender.\nAfter Petya's friend Vasya wrote instant messenger (an instant messaging program) that supported the Petya's language, Petya wanted to add spelling and grammar checking to the program. As Vasya was in the country and Petya didn't feel like waiting, he asked you to help him with this problem. Your task is to define by a given sequence of words, whether it is true that the given text represents exactly one sentence in Petya's language.\nInput specification: The first line contains one or more words consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The overall number of characters (including letters and spaces) does not exceed 105.\n\nIt is guaranteed that any two consecutive words are separated by exactly one space and the input data do not contain any other spaces. It is possible that given words do not belong to the Petya's language.. Output specification: If some word of the given text does not belong to the Petya's language or if the text contains more that one sentence, print \"NO\" (without the quotes).

Write a python script for the following problem: For some time the program of rounding numbers that had been developed by the Codeforces participants during one of the previous rounds, helped the citizens of Far Far Away to convert numbers into a more easily readable format. However, as time went by, the economy of the Far Far Away developed and the scale of operations grew. So the King ordered to found the Bank of Far Far Away and very soon even the rounding didn't help to quickly determine even the order of the numbers involved in operations. Besides, rounding a number to an integer wasn't very convenient as a bank needed to operate with all numbers with accuracy of up to 0.01, and not up to an integer.\n\nThe King issued yet another order: to introduce financial format to represent numbers denoting amounts of money. The formal rules of storing a number in the financial format are as follows: \n -  A number contains the integer part and the fractional part. The two parts are separated with a character \".\" (decimal point). -  To make digits in the integer part of a number easier to read, they are split into groups of three digits, starting from the least significant ones. The groups are separated with the character \",\" (comma). For example, if the integer part of a number equals 12345678, then it will be stored in the financial format as 12,345,678 -  In the financial format a number's fractional part should contain exactly two digits. So, if the initial number (the number that is converted into the financial format) contains less than two digits in the fractional part (or contains no digits at all), it is complemented with zeros until its length equals 2. If the fractional part contains more than two digits, the extra digits are simply discarded (they are not rounded: see sample tests). -  When a number is stored in the financial format, the minus sign is not written. Instead, if the initial number had the minus sign, the result is written in round brackets. -  Please keep in mind that the bank of Far Far Away operates using an exotic foreign currency \u2014 snakes ($), that's why right before the number in the financial format we should put the sign \"$\". If the number should be written in the brackets, then the snake sign should also be inside the brackets. \nFor example, by the above given rules number 2012 will be stored in the financial format as \"$2,012.00\" and number -12345678.9 will be stored as \"($12,345,678.90)\".\n\nThe merchants of Far Far Away visited you again and expressed much hope that you supply them with the program that can convert arbitrary numbers to the financial format. Can you help them?\nInput specification: The input contains a number that needs to be converted into financial format.

It means that if you press two or more switches connected to the same lamp then the lamp will be turned on after any of this switches is pressed and will remain its state even if any switch connected to this lamp is pressed afterwards.\n\nIt is guaranteed that if you push all *n* switches then all *m* lamps will be turned on.\n\nYour think that you have too many switches and you would like to ignore one of them. \n\nYour task is to say if there exists such a switch that if you will ignore (not use) it but press all the other *n*<=-<=1 switches then all the *m* lamps will be turned on.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=2000) \u2014 the number of the switches and the number of the lamps.\n\nThe following *n* lines contain *m* characters each. The character *a**i*,<=*j* is equal to '1' if the *i*-th switch turns on the *j*-th lamp and '0' otherwise.\n\nIt is guaranteed that if you press all *n* switches all *m* lamps will be turned on.. Output specification: Print \"YES\" if there is a switch that if you will ignore it and press all the other *n*<=-<=1 switches then all *m* lamps will be turned on. Print \"NO\" if there is no such switch.\nDemo input: ['4 5\\n10101\\n01000\\n00111\\n10000\\n', '4 5\\n10100\\n01000\\n00110\\n00101\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}
