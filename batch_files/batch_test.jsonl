Specifically, we can simplify each bid by dividing out all factors of 2 and 3, as those are the only operations allowed to change the numbers.\n\nThe following Python script implements this solution:\n\n```python\ndef normalize_bid(bid):\n    # Divide the bid by 2 and 3 until it's no longer divisible\n    while bid % 2 == 0:\n        bid //= 2\n    while bid % 3 == 0:\n        bid //= 3\n    return bid\n\ndef can_make_bids_equal(n, bids):\n    # Normalize all bids\n    normalized_bids = [normalize_bid(bid) for bid in bids]\n    \n    # Check if all normalized bids are the same\n    first_normalized_bid = normalized_bids[0]\n    for bid in normalized_bids:\n        if bid != first_normalized_bid:\n            return \"No\"\n    return \"Yes\"\n\n# Read input\nn = int(input().strip())\nbids = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))\n\n# Check if it's possible to make all bids equal\nresult = can_make_bids_equal(n, bids)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### How it works:\n1. **Normalize Each Bid**: The `normalize_bid` function continuously divides the bid by 2 and 3 until it cannot be divided anymore. This effectively reduces the bids to their core values that cannot be altered by the allowed operations.\n  \n2. **Compare Normalized Bids**: Once all bids are normalized, we check if they are the same. If they are, it means that it's possible to make all bids equal through the operations. If any normalized bid is different, then it's impossible.\n\n### Usage:\nYou can run this script and provide the input directly in the specified format.

However, after accounting for the time `k` needed to get to the party, the actual time he has left to solve problems is `240 - k` minutes.\n\n2. **Problem Solving Times**: The time required to solve each problem `i` is `5 * i` minutes:\n   - Problem 1 takes 5 minutes.\n   - Problem 2 takes 10 minutes.\n   - Problem 3 takes 15 minutes.\n   - And so on up to problem `n` which takes `5 * n` minutes.\n\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: We will loop through the problems from 1 to `n`, keeping a running total of the time taken to solve them.

The `encrypt_crossword` function takes two parameters: `n` (the length of the row) and `row` (the string of characters representing the row).\n2. It initializes a list `groups` to hold the sizes of consecutive black square groups and a counter `count` to count the length of current black square sequence.\n3. It iterates through each character in the row:\n   - If the character is 'B', it increments the `count`.\n   - If the character is 'W' and `count` is greater than 0, it means a group of black squares just ended, so it appends `count` to the `groups` list.\n4. After the loop, it checks if there's any remaining `count` (for a group that might end at the last character).\n5. It formats the result according to the specification:\n   - First the number of groups.\n   - Second the space-separated sizes of each group, followed by a space (if there are groups).\n6.

Therefore, \\( 180 - a \\) must divide 360 evenly.\n\n### Steps:\n1. For each angle `a`, calculate `360 / (180 - a)`.\n2. Check if the result is a whole number (i.e., if `360 % (180 - a) == 0`).\n3. Print \"YES\" if it is a whole number and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in a Python script as described:\n\n```python\ndef can_build_polygon(t, angles):\n    results = []\n    for a in angles:\n        if a < 180:\n            if 360 % (180 - a) == 0:\n                results.append(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")  # For angle 180 and beyond, it's impossible\n    return results\n\n# Input reading\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    t = int(input())\n    angles = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]\n    results = can_build_polygon(t, angles)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n```\n\n### How to Use:\n1.

The color of a square can be determined by the sum of its coordinates. Specifically, if `(r1 + c1) % 2 == (r2 + c2) % 2`, the bishop can reach its destination.\n   - If they are on the same diagonal, it can reach the target in 1 move.\n   - Otherwise, if they are of the same color but not on the same diagonal, it can reach the target in 2 moves.\n   - If they are of different colors, it is impossible for the bishop to reach the target, hence it would return 0 moves.\n\n3. **King**: The king moves one square in any direction.\n   - The minimum number of moves for a king from `(r1, c1)` to `(r2, c2)` is equal to the maximum of the differences in row and column: `max(abs(r2 - r1), abs(c2 - c1))`.\n\nWith this understanding, we can implement the solution in Python.

This technique creates a sequence where larger values alternate with smaller values.\n3. **Building the Result Sequence**: Create the new sequence by alternating elements from the two ends of the sorted list. This arrangement will yield the largest possible value of the arrangement.\n4. **Lexicographically Smallest**: By constructing the sequence this way from a sorted list, we also ensure that the result is lexicographically smallest.\n\nHere's the Python code that implements the above approach:\n\n```python\ndef arrange_integers(n, a):\n    # Sort the input array\n    a.sort()\n\n    # Two pointers\n    left = 0\n    right = n - 1\n    result = []\n\n    # Create an arrangement using the two-pointer technique\n    while left <= right:\n        if left == right:  # if both pointers meet\n            result.append(a[left])\n        else:\n            result.append(a[right])\n            result.append(a[left])\n        left += 1\n        right -= 1\n\n    return result\n\n\n# Input Reading\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))\n\n# Getting the arranged sequence\nresult_sequence = arrange_integers(n, a)\n\n# Output result\nprint(' '.join(map(str, result_sequence)))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **Sorting**: The input array `a` is sorted to facilitate the two-pointer technique.\n- **Two-Pointer Loop**: In a while loop, we keep picking elements from both ends of the sorted list.
