Write a python script for the following problem: A new innovative ticketing systems for public transport is introduced in Bytesburg. Now there is a single travel card for all transport. To make a trip a passenger scan his card and then he is charged according to the fare.\n\nThe fare is constructed in the following manner. There are three types of tickets: \n 1.  a ticket for one trip costs 20 byteland rubles, 1.  a ticket for 90 minutes costs 50 byteland rubles, 1.  a ticket for one day (1440 minutes) costs 120 byteland rubles. \nNote that a ticket for *x* minutes activated at time *t* can be used for trips started in time range from *t* to *t*<=+<=*x*<=-<=1, inclusive. Assume that all trips take exactly one minute.\n\nTo simplify the choice for the passenger, the system automatically chooses the optimal tickets. After each trip starts, the system analyses all the previous trips and the current trip and chooses a set of tickets for these trips with a minimum total cost. Let the minimum total cost of tickets to cover all trips from the first to the current is *a*, and the total sum charged before is *b*. Then the system charges the passenger the sum *a*<=-<=*b*.\n\nYou have to write a program that, for given trips made by a passenger, calculates the sum the passenger is charged after each trip.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains integer number *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of trips made by passenger.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains the time of trip *t**i* (0<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=109), measured in minutes from the time of starting the system. All *t**i* are different, given in ascending order, i.\u00a0e. *t**i*<=+<=1<=&gt;<=*t**i* holds for all 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*n*.. Output specification: Output *n* integers. For each trip, print the sum the passenger is charged after it.\nDemo input: ['3\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n', '10\\n13\\n45\\n46\\n60\\n103\\n115\\n126\\n150\\n256\\n516\\n'], Demo output: ['20\\n20\\n10\\n', '20\\n20\\n10\\n0\\n20\\n0\\n0\\n20\\n20\\n10\\n']\nNote: In the first example, the system works as follows: for the first and second trips it is cheaper to pay for two one-trip tickets, so each time 20 rubles is charged, after the third trip the system understands that it would be cheaper to buy a ticket for 90 minutes. This ticket costs 50 rubles, and the passenger had already paid 40 rubles, so it is necessary to charge 10 rubles only."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: You helped Dima to have a great weekend, but it's time to work. Naturally, Dima, as all other men who have girlfriends, does everything wrong.\n\nInna and Dima are now in one room. Inna tells Dima off for everything he does in her presence. After Inna tells him off for something, she goes to another room, walks there in circles muttering about how useless her sweetheart is. During that time Dima has time to peacefully complete *k*<=-<=1 tasks. Then Inna returns and tells Dima off for the next task he does in her presence and goes to another room again. It continues until Dima is through with his tasks.\n\nOverall, Dima has *n* tasks to do, each task has a unique number from 1 to *n*. Dima loves order, so he does tasks consecutively, starting from some task. For example, if Dima has 6 tasks to do in total, then, if he starts from the 5-th task, the order is like that: first Dima does the 5-th task, then the 6-th one, then the 1-st one, then the 2-nd one, then the 3-rd one, then the 4-th one.\n\nInna tells Dima off (only lovingly and appropriately!) so often and systematically that he's very well learned the power with which she tells him off for each task. Help Dima choose the first task so that in total he gets told off with as little power as possible.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n*,<=*k*\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105). The second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=103), where *a**i* is the power Inna tells Dima off with if she is present in the room while he is doing the *i*-th task.\n\nIt is guaranteed that *n* is divisible by *k*.. Output specification: In a single line print the number of the task Dima should start with to get told off with as little power as possible. If there are multiple solutions, print the one with the minimum number of the first task to do.\nDemo input: ['6 2\\n3 2 1 6 5 4\\n', '10 5\\n1 3 5 7 9 9 4 1 8 5\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '3\\n']\nNote: Explanation of the first example.\n\nIf Dima starts from the first task, Inna tells him off with power 3, then Dima can do one more task (as *k* = 2), then Inna tells him off for the third task with power 1, then she tells him off for the fifth task with power 5. Thus, Dima gets told off with total power 3 + 1 + 5 = 9. If Dima started from the second task, for example, then Inna would tell him off for tasks 2, 4 and 6 with power 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \n\nExplanation of the second example.\n\nIn the second example *k* = 5, thus, Dima manages to complete 4 tasks in-between the telling off sessions. Thus, Inna tells Dima off for tasks number 1 and 6 (if he starts from 1 or 6), 2 and 7 (if he starts from 2 or 7) and so on. The optimal answer is to start from task 3 or 8, 3 has a smaller number, so the answer is 3."}]}}

For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\n\nVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads \u2014 major and minor.\n\nLet's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes *X*, *Y* and *Z*. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between *X* and *Y* equals 4 semitones and the distance between *Y* and *Z* is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between *X* and *Z*, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.\n\nA minor triad is different in that the distance between *X* and *Y* should be 3 semitones and between *Y* and *Z* \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nFor example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nHelp Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\nInput specification: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.. Output specification: Print \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\nDemo input: ['C E G\\n', 'C# B F\\n', 'A B H\\n'], Demo output: ['major\\n', 'minor\\n', 'strange\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order.

Help him find out whether the moon will be up or down next day, or this cannot be determined by the data he has.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=92)\u00a0\u2014 the number of consecutive days Vitya was watching the size of the visible part of the moon. \n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a**i* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=15)\u00a0\u2014 Vitya's records.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the input data is consistent.. Output specification: If Vitya can be sure that the size of visible part of the moon on day *n*<=+<=1 will be less than the size of the visible part on day *n*, then print \"DOWN\" at the only line of the output. If he might be sure that the size of the visible part will increase, then print \"UP\". If it's impossible to determine what exactly will happen with the moon, print -1.\nDemo input: ['5\\n3 4 5 6 7\\n', '7\\n12 13 14 15 14 13 12\\n', '1\\n8\\n'], Demo output: ['UP\\n', 'DOWN\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, the size of the moon on the next day will be equal to 8, thus the answer is \"UP\".\n\nIn the second sample, the size of the moon on the next day will be 11, thus the answer is \"DOWN\".\n\nIn the third sample, there is no way to determine whether the size of the moon on the next day will be 7 or 9, thus the answer is -1."}]}}

Having learned the news, the colonel ordered to all *n* squad soldiers to line up on the parade ground.\n\nBy the military charter the soldiers should stand in the order of non-increasing of their height. But as there's virtually no time to do that, the soldiers lined up in the arbitrary order. However, the general is rather short-sighted and he thinks that the soldiers lined up correctly if the first soldier in the line has the maximum height and the last soldier has the minimum height. Please note that the way other solders are positioned does not matter, including the case when there are several soldiers whose height is maximum or minimum. Only the heights of the first and the last soldier are important.\n\nFor example, the general considers the sequence of heights (4, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1) correct and the sequence (4, 3, 1, 2, 2) wrong.\n\nWithin one second the colonel can swap any two neighboring soldiers.

The qualification *q**j* of each employee is known, and for each application the following is true: *q**a**i*<=&gt;<=*q**b**i*. \n\nWould you help Nick calculate the minimum cost of such a hierarchy, or find out that it is impossible to build it.\nInput specification: The first input line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 amount of employees in the company. The following line contains *n* space-separated numbers *q**j* (0<=\u2264<=*q**j*<=\u2264<=106)\u2014 the employees' qualifications. The following line contains number *m* (0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=10000) \u2014 amount of received applications. The following *m* lines contain the applications themselves, each of them in the form of three space-separated numbers: *a**i*, *b**i* and *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, 0<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=106). Different applications can be similar, i.e. they can come from one and the same employee who offered to become a supervisor of the same person but at a different cost. For each application *q**a**i*<=&gt;<=*q**b**i*.. Output specification: Output the only line \u2014 the minimum cost of building such a hierarchy, or -1 if it is impossible to build it.\nDemo input: ['4\\n7 2 3 1\\n4\\n1 2 5\\n2 4 1\\n3 4 1\\n1 3 5\\n', '3\\n1 2 3\\n2\\n3 1 2\\n3 1 3\\n'], Demo output: ['11\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: In the first sample one of the possible ways for building a hierarchy is to take applications with indexes 1, 2 and 4, which give 11 as the minimum total cost. In the second sample it is impossible to build the required hierarchy, so the answer is -1."}]}}

They will play $r+1$ times though, so between each game, exactly one value of $f$ changes. In other words, between rounds $i$ and $i+1$ for $1 \\le i \\le r$, $f(z_1, \\dots, z_n) \\to g_i$ for some $(z_1, \\dots, z_n) \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$. You are to find the expected game value in the beginning and after each change.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers $n$ and $r$ ($1 \\le n \\le 18$, $0 \\le r \\le 2^{18}$).\n\nThe next line contains $2^n$ integers $c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{2^n-1}$ ($0 \\le c_i \\le 10^9$), denoting the initial values of $f$. More specifically, $f(x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{n-1}) = c_x$, if $x = \\overline{x_{n-1} \\ldots x_0}$ in binary.\n\nEach of the next $r$ lines contains two integers $z$ and $g$ ($0 \\le z \\le 2^n - 1$, $0 \\le g \\le 10^9$). If $z = \\overline{z_{n-1} \\dots z_0}$ in binary, then this means to set $f(z_0, \\dots, z_{n-1}) \\to g$.. Output specification: Print $r+1$ lines, the $i$-th of which denotes the value of the game $f$ during the $i$-th round. Your answer must have absolute or relative error within $10^{-6}$.\n\nFormally, let your answer be $a$, and the jury's answer be $b$. Your answer is considered correct if $\\frac{|a - b|}{\\max{(1, |b|)}} \\le 10^{-6}$.\nDemo input: ['2 2\\n0 1 2 3\\n2 5\\n0 4\\n', '1 0\\n2 3\\n', '2 0\\n1 1 1 1\\n'], Demo output: ['1.500000\\n2.250000\\n3.250000\\n', '2.500000\\n', '1.000000\\n']\nNote: Consider the second test case. If Allen goes first, he will set $x_1 \\to 1$, so the final value will be $3$. If Bessie goes first, then she will set $x_1 \\to 0$ so the final value will be $2$. Thus the answer is $2.5$.\n\nIn the third test case, the game value will always be $1$ regardless of Allen and Bessie's play."}]}}

In other words, good strings are all strings we can obtain by moving from the left upper cell of the table only to the right and down. Here's the formal definition of correct paths:\n\nConsider rows of the table are numbered from 1 to *n* from top to bottom, and columns of the table are numbered from 1 to *n* from left to the right. Cell (*r*,<=*c*) is a cell of table *T* on the *r*-th row and in the *c*-th column. This cell corresponds to letter *T**r*,<=*c*.\n\nA path of length *k* is a sequence of table cells [(*r*1,<=*c*1),<=(*r*2,<=*c*2),<=...,<=(*r**k*,<=*c**k*)]. The following paths are correct: \n 1.

In the first case it will be a draw (the string has one a and one b), in the second case the first player wins.

Write a python script for the following problem: Programmer Sasha is a student at MIPT (Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology) and he needs to make a laboratory work to pass his finals.\n\nA laboratory unit is a plane with standard coordinate axes marked on it. Physicists from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology charged the axes by large electric charges: axis *X* is positive and axis *Y* is negative.\n\nExperienced laboratory worker marked *n* points with integer coordinates (*x**i*,<=*y**i*) on the plane and stopped the time. Sasha should use \"atomic tweezers\" to place elementary particles in these points. He has an unlimited number of electrons (negatively charged elementary particles) and protons (positively charged elementary particles). He can put either an electron or a proton at each marked point. As soon as all marked points are filled with particles, laboratory worker will turn on the time again and the particles will come in motion and after some time they will stabilize in equilibrium.

Write a python script for the following problem: Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Far Far Away lived Sam the Farmer. Sam had a cow named Dawn and he was deeply attached to her. Sam would spend the whole summer stocking hay to feed Dawn in winter. Sam scythed hay and put it into haystack. As Sam was a bright farmer, he tried to make the process of storing hay simpler and more convenient to use. He collected the hay into cubical hay blocks of the same size. Then he stored the blocks in his barn. After a summer spent in hard toil Sam stored *A*\u00b7*B*\u00b7*C* hay blocks and stored them in a barn as a rectangular parallelepiped *A* layers high. Each layer had *B* rows and each row had *C* blocks.\n\nAt the end of the autumn Sam came into the barn to admire one more time the hay he'd been stacking during this hard summer. Unfortunately, Sam was horrified to see that the hay blocks had been carelessly scattered around the barn. The place was a complete mess. As it turned out, thieves had sneaked into the barn. They completely dissembled and took away a layer of blocks from the parallelepiped's front, back, top and sides. As a result, the barn only had a parallelepiped containing (*A*<=-<=1)<=\u00d7<=(*B*<=-<=2)<=\u00d7<=(*C*<=-<=2) hay blocks. To hide the evidence of the crime, the thieves had dissembled the parallelepiped into single 1<=\u00d7<=1<=\u00d7<=1 blocks and scattered them around the barn. After the theft Sam counted *n* hay blocks in the barn but he forgot numbers *A*, *B* \u0438 *C*.\n\nGiven number *n*, find the minimally possible and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks.\nInput specification: The only line contains integer *n* from the problem's statement (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=109).. Output specification: Print space-separated minimum and maximum number of hay blocks that could have been stolen by the thieves.\n\nNote that the answer to the problem can be large enough, so you must use the 64-bit integer type for calculations. Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.\nDemo input: ['4\\n', '7\\n', '12\\n'], Demo output: ['28 41\\n', '47 65\\n', '48 105\\n']\nNote: Let's consider the first sample test.

Output specification: Print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 minimal number of additional marks, that Leha has to add in order to change Noora's final mark to *k*.\nDemo input: ['2 10\\n8 9\\n', '3 5\\n4 4 4\\n'], Demo output: ['4', '3']\nNote: Consider the first example testcase.\n\nMaximal mark is 10, Noora received two marks\u00a0\u2014 8 and 9, so current final mark is 9. To fix it, Leha can add marks [10,\u200910,\u200910,\u200910] (4 marks in total) to the registry, achieving Noora having average mark equal to <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/1b961585522f76271546da990a6228e7c666277f.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>. Consequently, new final mark is 10. Less number of marks won't fix the situation.\n\nIn the second example Leha can add [5,\u20095,\u20095] to the registry, so that making average mark equal to 4.5, which is enough to have 5 in the certificate."}]}}

We'll consider the spies numbered from 1 to *n* from left to right. \n\nSpy *s* has an important note. He has to pass the note to spy *f*. Xenia interrogates the spies in several steps. During one step the spy keeping the important note can pass the note to one of his neighbours in the row. In other words, if this spy's number is *x*, he can pass the note to another spy, either *x*<=-<=1 or *x*<=+<=1 (if *x*<==<=1 or *x*<==<=*n*, then the spy has only one neighbour). Also during a step the spy can keep a note and not pass it to anyone.\n\nBut nothing is that easy. During *m* steps Xenia watches some spies attentively.

In other words, difficulty equals the maximum distance between two holds that are adjacent in height.\n\nToday Mike decided to cover the track with holds hanging on heights *a*1, ..., *a**n*. To make the problem harder, Mike decided to remove one hold, that is, remove one element of the sequence (for example, if we take the sequence (1,<=2,<=3,<=4,<=5) and remove the third element from it, we obtain the sequence (1,<=2,<=4,<=5)). However, as Mike is awful at climbing, he wants the final difficulty (i.e. the maximum difference of heights between adjacent holds after removing the hold) to be as small as possible among all possible options of removing a hold. The first and last holds must stay at their positions.\n\nHelp Mike determine the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of holds.\n\nThe next line contains *n* space-separated integers *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=1000), where *a**i* is the height where the hold number *i* hangs.

However, Vasilisa the Wise does not know what the box's secret is, since she cannot open it again. She hopes that you will help her one more time with that.\n\nThe box's lock looks as follows: it contains 4 identical deepenings for gems as a 2<=\u00d7<=2 square, and some integer numbers are written at the lock's edge near the deepenings. The example of a lock is given on the picture below.\n\nThe box is accompanied with 9 gems.

The guys do not know anything about the suffix tree, but it can help them do much more. \n\nBizon the Champion wonders whether the \"Bizons\" can solve the problem. Perhaps, the solution do not require both data structures. Find out whether the guys can solve the problem and if they can, how do they do it? Can they solve it either only with use of suffix automaton or only with use of suffix array or they need both structures? Note that any structure may be used an unlimited number of times, the structures may be used in any order.\nInput specification: The first line contains a non-empty word *s*. The second line contains a non-empty word *t*. Words *s* and *t* are different. Each word consists only of lowercase English letters. Each word contains at most 100 letters.. Output specification: In the single line print the answer to the problem. Print \"need tree\" (without the quotes) if word *s* cannot be transformed into word *t* even with use of both suffix array and suffix automaton. Print \"automaton\" (without the quotes) if you need only the suffix automaton to solve the problem. Print \"array\" (without the quotes) if you need only the suffix array to solve the problem. Print \"both\" (without the quotes), if you need both data structures to solve the problem.\n\nIt's guaranteed that if you can solve the problem only with use of suffix array, then it is impossible to solve it only with use of suffix automaton. This is also true for suffix automaton.\nDemo input: ['automaton\\ntomat\\n', 'array\\narary\\n', 'both\\nhot\\n', 'need\\ntree\\n'], Demo output: ['automaton\\n', 'array\\n', 'both\\n', 'need tree\\n']\nNote: In the third sample you can act like that: first transform \"both\" into \"oth\" by removing the first character using the suffix automaton and then make two swaps of the string using the suffix array and get \"hot\"."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.

This game not only develops the children's physique, but also teaches them how to count. \n\nThe game goes as follows. Kids stand in circle. Let's agree to think of the children as numbered with numbers from 1 to *n* clockwise and the child number 1 is holding the ball. First the first child throws the ball to the next one clockwise, i.e. to the child number 2. Then the child number 2 throws the ball to the next but one child, i.e. to the child number 4, then the fourth child throws the ball to the child that stands two children away from him, i.e. to the child number 7, then the ball is thrown to the child who stands 3 children away from the child number 7, then the ball is thrown to the child who stands 4 children away from the last one, and so on. It should be mentioned that when a ball is thrown it may pass the beginning of the circle. For example, if *n*<==<=5, then after the third throw the child number 2 has the ball again. Overall, *n*<=-<=1 throws are made, and the game ends.\n\nThe problem is that not all the children get the ball during the game. If a child doesn't get the ball, he gets very upset and cries until Natalia Pavlovna gives him a candy. That's why Natalia Pavlovna asks you to help her to identify the numbers of the children who will get the ball after each throw.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) which indicates the number of kids in the circle..

Write a python script for the following problem: Special Agent Smart Beaver works in a secret research department of ABBYY. He's been working there for a long time and is satisfied with his job, as it allows him to eat out in the best restaurants and order the most expensive and exotic wood types there. \n\nThe content special agent has got an important task: to get the latest research by British scientists on the English Language. These developments are encoded and stored in a large safe. The Beaver's teeth are strong enough, so the authorities assured that upon arriving at the place the beaver won't have any problems with opening the safe.\n\nAnd he finishes his aspen sprig and leaves for this important task. Of course, the Beaver arrived at the location without any problems, but alas. He can't open the safe with his strong and big teeth. At this point, the Smart Beaver get a call from the headquarters and learns that opening the safe with the teeth is not necessary, as a reliable source has sent the following information: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. There also is a special hint, which can be used to open the safe. The hint is string *s* with the following structure:\n -  if *s**i* = \"?\", then the digit that goes *i*-th in the safe code can be anything (between 0 to 9, inclusively); -  if *s**i* is a digit (between 0 to 9, inclusively), then it means that there is digit *s**i* on position *i* in code; -  if the string contains letters from \"A\" to \"J\", then all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits and the positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits. -  The length of the safe code coincides with the length of the hint. \nFor example, hint \"?JGJ9\" has such matching safe code variants: \"51919\", \"55959\", \"12329\", \"93539\" and so on, and has wrong variants such as: \"56669\", \"00111\", \"03539\" and \"13666\".\n\nAfter receiving such information, the authorities change the plan and ask the special agents to work quietly and gently and not to try to open the safe by mechanical means, and try to find the password using the given hint.\n\nAt a special agent school the Smart Beaver was the fastest in his platoon finding codes for such safes, but now he is not in that shape: the years take their toll ... Help him to determine the number of possible variants of the code to the safe, matching the given hint.

Write a python script for the following problem: You're a mikemon breeder currently in the middle of your journey to become a mikemon master. Your current obstacle is go through the infamous Biridian Forest.\n\nThe forest\n\nThe Biridian Forest is a two-dimensional grid consisting of *r* rows and *c* columns. Each cell in Biridian Forest may contain a tree, or may be vacant. A vacant cell may be occupied by zero or more mikemon breeders (there may also be breeders other than you in the forest). Mikemon breeders (including you) cannot enter cells with trees. One of the cells is designated as the exit cell.\n\nThe initial grid, including your initial position, the exit cell, and the initial positions of all other breeders, will be given to you. Here's an example of such grid (from the first example):\n\nMoves\n\nBreeders (including you) may move in the forest. In a single move, breeders may perform one of the following actions: \n -  Do nothing. -  Move from the current cell to one of the four adjacent cells (two cells are adjacent if they share a side). Note that breeders cannot enter cells with trees. -  If you are located on the exit cell, you may leave the forest. Only you can perform this move \u2014 all other mikemon breeders will never leave the forest by using this type of movement. \nAfter each time you make a single move, each of the other breeders simultaneously make a single move (the choice of which move to make may be different for each of the breeders).\n\nMikemon battle\n\nIf you and *t* (*t*<=&gt;<=0) mikemon breeders are located on the same cell, exactly *t* mikemon battles will ensue that time (since you will be battling each of those *t* breeders once). After the battle, all of those *t* breeders will leave the forest to heal their respective mikemons.\n\nNote that the moment you leave the forest, no more mikemon battles can ensue, even if another mikemon breeder move to the exit cell immediately after that. Also note that a battle only happens between you and another breeders \u2014 there will be no battle between two other breeders (there may be multiple breeders coexisting in a single cell).\n\nYour goal\n\nYou would like to leave the forest. In order to do so, you have to make a sequence of moves, ending with a move of the final type. Before you make any move, however, you post this sequence on your personal virtual idol Blog. Then, you will follow this sequence of moves faithfully.\n\nGoal of other breeders\n\nBecause you post the sequence in your Blog, the other breeders will all know your exact sequence of moves even before you make your first move. All of them will move in such way that will guarantee a mikemon battle with you, if possible. The breeders that couldn't battle you will do nothing.\n\nYour task\n\nPrint the minimum number of mikemon battles that you must participate in, assuming that you pick the sequence of moves that minimize this number. Note that you are not required to minimize the number of moves you make.\nInput specification: The first line consists of two integers: *r* and *c* (1<=\u2264<=*r*,<=*c*<=\u2264<=1000), denoting the number of rows and the number of columns in Biridian Forest. The next *r* rows will each depict a row of the map, where each character represents the content of a single cell: \n -  'T': A cell occupied by a tree. -  'S': An empty cell, and your starting position. There will be exactly one occurence of this in the map. -  'E': An empty cell, and where the exit is located. There will be exactly one occurence of this in the map. -  A digit (0-9): A cell represented by a digit X means that the cell is empty and is occupied by X breeders (in particular, if X is zero, it means that the cell is not occupied by any breeder). \nIt is guaranteed that it will be possible for you to go from your starting position to the exit cell through a sequence of moves.. Output specification: A single line denoted the minimum possible number of mikemon battles that you have to participate in if you pick a strategy that minimize this number.\nDemo input: ['5 7\\n000E0T3\\nT0TT0T0\\n010T0T0\\n2T0T0T0\\n0T0S000\\n', '1 4\\nSE23\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: The following picture illustrates the first example. The blue line denotes a possible sequence of moves that you should post in your blog:\n\nThe three breeders on the left side of the map will be able to battle you \u2014 the lone breeder can simply stay in his place until you come while the other two breeders can move to where the lone breeder is and stay there until you come. The three breeders on the right does not have a way to battle you, so they will stay in their place.\n\nFor the second example, you should post this sequence in your Blog:\n\nHere's what happens. First, you move one cell to the right.\n\nThen, the two breeders directly to the right of the exit will simultaneously move to the left. The other three breeder cannot battle you so they will do nothing.\n\nYou end up in the same cell with 2 breeders, so 2 mikemon battles are conducted. After those battles, all of your opponents leave the forest.\n\nFinally, you make another move by leaving the forest."}]}}

A pattern is usually defined as a string consisting of characters and metacharacters that sets the rules for your search. These patterns are most often used to check whether a particular string meets the certain rules.\n\nIn this task, a pattern will be a string consisting of small English letters and question marks ('?'). The question mark in the pattern is a metacharacter that denotes an arbitrary small letter of the English alphabet. We will assume that a string matches the pattern if we can transform the string into the pattern by replacing the question marks by the appropriate characters. For example, string aba matches patterns: ???, ??a, a?a, aba.\n\nProgrammers that work for the R1 company love puzzling each other (and themselves) with riddles. One of them is as follows: you are given *n* patterns of the same length, you need to find a pattern that contains as few question marks as possible, and intersects with each of the given patterns. Two patterns intersect if there is a string that matches both the first and the second pattern. Can you solve this riddle?\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of patterns. Next *n* lines contain the patterns.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the patterns can only consist of small English letters and symbols '?'. All patterns are non-empty and have the same length. The total length of all the patterns does not exceed 105 characters.. Output specification: In a single line print the answer to the problem \u2014 the pattern with the minimal number of signs '?', which intersects with each of the given ones. If there are several answers, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['2\\n?ab\\n??b\\n', '2\\na\\nb\\n', '1\\n?a?b\\n'], Demo output: ['xab\\n', '?\\n', 'cacb\\n']\nNote: Consider the first example. Pattern xab intersects with each of the given patterns. Pattern ??? also intersects with each of the given patterns, but it contains more question signs, hence it is not an optimal answer. Clearly, xab is the optimal answer, because it doesn't contain any question sign. There are a lot of other optimal answers, for example: aab, bab, cab, dab and so on."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Imagine that you have a twin brother or sister. Having another person that looks exactly like you seems very unusual. It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.\n\nNow let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins. The second line contains a sequence of *n* integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the coins' values. All numbers are separated with spaces..

If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too. You can pick coins with values 1,\u20092 or 2,\u20092. In any case, the minimum number of coins equals 2."}]}}

He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture.

In other words, if this spy's number is *x*, he can pass the note to another spy, either *x*<=-<=1 or *x*<=+<=1 (if *x*<==<=1 or *x*<==<=*n*, then the spy has only one neighbour). Also during a step the spy can keep a note and not pass it to anyone.\n\nBut nothing is that easy. During *m* steps Xenia watches some spies attentively.

The grandmother has a large garden, which can be represented as a rectangle 1<=\u00d7<=*n* in size, when viewed from above. This rectangle is divided into *n* equal square sections. The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.\n\nCreating artificial rain is an expensive operation.

The next *k* lines each start with an integer *x* (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*) which means that there are *x* words in this group, followed by *x* integers which represent the indices of words in this group. It's guaranteed that each word appears in exactly one group.\n\nThe next line contains *m* space-separated words which represent Mahmoud's message. Each of these words appears in the list of language's words.. Output specification: The only line should contain the minimum cost to send the message after replacing some words (maybe none) with some words of the same meaning.\nDemo input: ['5 4 4\\ni loser am the second\\n100 1 1 5 10\\n1 1\\n1 3\\n2 2 5\\n1 4\\ni am the second\\n', '5 4 4\\ni loser am the second\\n100 20 1 5 10\\n1 1\\n1 3\\n2 2 5\\n1 4\\ni am the second\\n'], Demo output: ['107', '116']\nNote: In the first sample, Mahmoud should replace the word \"second\" with the word \"loser\" because it has less cost so the cost will be 100+1+5+1=107.\n\nIn the second sample, Mahmoud shouldn't do any replacement so the cost will be 100+1+5+10=116."}]}}

Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop.

To ensure a better life for the Mars citizens, their emperor decided to take tax from every tourist who visited the planet. Natasha is the inhabitant of Earth, therefore she had to pay the tax to enter the territory of Mars.\n\nThere are $n$ banknote denominations on Mars: the value of $i$-th banknote is $a_i$. Natasha has an infinite number of banknotes of each denomination.\n\nMartians have $k$ fingers on their hands, so they use a number system with base $k$. In addition, the Martians consider the digit $d$ (in the number system with base $k$) divine. Thus, if the last digit in Natasha's tax amount written in the number system with the base $k$ is $d$, the Martians will be happy. Unfortunately, Natasha does not know the Martians' divine digit yet.\n\nDetermine for which values $d$ Natasha can make the Martians happy.\n\nNatasha can use only her banknotes. Martians don't give her change.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000$, $2 \\le k \\le 100\\,000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of denominations of banknotes and the base of the number system on Mars.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 denominations of banknotes on Mars.\n\nAll numbers are given in decimal notation..

The last digit is $0_8$.\n\nIf you take two banknotes with the value of $20$, the total value will be $40$, this is $50_8$ in the octal system. The last digit is $0_8$.\n\nNo other digits other than $0_8$ and $4_8$ can be obtained. Digits $0_8$ and $4_8$ could also be obtained in other ways.\n\nThe second test case uses the decimal number system.

Write a python script for the following problem: Vasya studies music. \n\nHe has learned lots of interesting stuff. For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\n\nVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads \u2014 major and minor.\n\nLet's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes *X*, *Y* and *Z*. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between *X* and *Y* equals 4 semitones and the distance between *Y* and *Z* is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between *X* and *Z*, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.\n\nA minor triad is different in that the distance between *X* and *Y* should be 3 semitones and between *Y* and *Z* \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nFor example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nHelp Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\nInput specification: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.. Output specification: Print \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\nDemo input: ['C E G\\n', 'C# B F\\n', 'A B H\\n'], Demo output: ['major\\n', 'minor\\n', 'strange\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Each region contains some positive number of consecutive levels.\n\nThe game repeats the the following process:\n1.  If all regions are beaten then the game ends immediately. Otherwise, the system finds the first region with at least one non-beaten level. Let *X* denote this region.1.  The system creates an empty bag for tokens. Each token will represent one level and there may be many tokens representing the same level.  For each already beaten level *i* in the region *X*, the system adds *t**i* tokens to the bag (tokens representing the *i*-th level). 1.  Let *j* denote the first non-beaten level in the region *X*. The system adds *t**j* tokens to the bag. 1.  Finally, the system takes a uniformly random token from the bag and a player starts the level represented by the token. A player spends one hour and beats the level, even if he has already beaten it in the past. \nGiven *n*, *k* and values *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n*, your task is to split levels into regions.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.

Christmas is coming, so sponsors decided to decorate the Christmas tree with their prizes. \n\nThey took *n* prizes for the contestants and wrote on each of them a unique id (integer from 1 to *n*). A gift *i* is characterized by integer *a**i*\u00a0\u2014 pleasantness of the gift. The pleasantness of the gift can be positive, negative or zero. Sponsors placed the gift 1 on the top of the tree. All the other gifts hung on a rope tied to some other gift so that each gift hung on the first gift, possibly with a sequence of ropes and another gifts. Formally, the gifts formed a rooted tree with *n* vertices.\n\nThe prize-giving procedure goes in the following way: the participants come to the tree one after another, choose any of the remaining gifts and cut the rope this prize hang on. Note that all the ropes which were used to hang other prizes on the chosen one are not cut. So the contestant gets the chosen gift as well as the all the gifts that hang on it, possibly with a sequence of ropes and another gifts.\n\nOur friends, Chloe and Vladik, shared the first place on the olympiad and they will choose prizes at the same time! To keep themselves from fighting, they decided to choose two different gifts so that the sets of the gifts that hang on them with a sequence of ropes and another gifts don't intersect. In other words, there shouldn't be any gift that hang both on the gift chosen by Chloe and on the gift chosen by Vladik. From all of the possible variants they will choose such pair of prizes that the sum of pleasantness of all the gifts that they will take after cutting the ropes is as large as possible.\n\nPrint the maximum sum of pleasantness that Vladik and Chloe can get.

Also, the statement is true, for example, for a card with 'b' and '4', and for a card with 'b' and '3' (since the letter is not a vowel).

By these years you have developed a good tradition \u2014 when it rains, you go on the street and stay silent for a moment, contemplate all around you, enjoy freshness, think about big deeds you have to do. \n\nToday everything had changed quietly. You went on the street with a cup contained water, your favorite drink. In a moment when you were drinking a water you noticed that the process became quite long: the cup still contained water because of rain. You decided to make a formal model of what was happening and to find if it was possible to drink all water in that situation. \n\nThus, your cup is a cylinder with diameter equals *d* centimeters. Initial level of water in cup equals *h* centimeters from the bottom. \n\nYou drink a water with a speed equals *v* milliliters per second. But rain goes with such speed that if you do not drink a water from the cup, the level of water increases on *e* centimeters per second. The process of drinking water from the cup and the addition of rain to the cup goes evenly and continuously. \n\nFind the time needed to make the cup empty or find that it will never happen. It is guaranteed that if it is possible to drink all water, it will happen not later than after 104 seconds.\n\nNote one milliliter equals to one cubic centimeter.\nInput specification: The only line of the input contains four integer numbers *d*,<=*h*,<=*v*,<=*e* (1<=\u2264<=*d*,<=*h*,<=*v*,<=*e*<=\u2264<=104), where:\n -  *d* \u2014 the diameter of your cylindrical cup, -  *h* \u2014 the initial level of water in the cup, -  *v* \u2014 the speed of drinking process from the cup in milliliters per second, -  *e* \u2014 the growth of water because of rain if you do not drink from the cup..

The apartment has an elevator with a digital counter showing the floor that the elevator is currently on. The elevator shows each digit of a number with 7 light sticks by turning them on or off. The picture below shows how the elevator shows each digit.\n\nOne day when Malek wanted to go from floor 88 to floor 0 using the elevator he noticed that the counter shows number 89 instead of 88. Then when the elevator started moving the number on the counter changed to 87. After a little thinking Malek came to the conclusion that there is only one explanation for this: One of the sticks of the counter was broken. Later that day Malek was thinking about the broken stick and suddenly he came up with the following problem.\n\nSuppose the digital counter is showing number *n*. Malek calls an integer *x* (0<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=99) good if it's possible that the digital counter was supposed to show *x* but because of some(possibly none) broken sticks it's showing *n* instead. Malek wants to know number of good integers for a specific *n*. So you must write a program that calculates this number. Please note that the counter always shows two digits.\nInput specification: The only line of input contains exactly two digits representing number *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=99).

Calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this column (including the given square) and separately calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this row (including the given square). A square is considered winning if the sum of the column numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the row numbers.\n\nFor instance, lets game was ended like is shown in the picture.

For example, each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform and guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium, the players put on the guest uniform.

Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis.

Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*.

Write a python script for the following problem: Let's define the permutation of length *n* as an array *p*<==<=[*p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n*] consisting of *n* distinct integers from range from 1 to *n*. We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value *p*1, value 2 into the value *p*2 and so on.\n\nKyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a permutation. A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle). The cyclic representation is a representation of *p* as a collection of cycles forming *p*. For example, permutation *p*<==<=[4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] has a cyclic representation that looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are swapped, and 5 remains in place. \n\nPermutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya defines the standard cyclic representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first. Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation of [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] is (421)(5)(63).\n\nNow, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For instance, [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] will become [4,<=2,<=1,<=5,<=6,<=3].\n\nKyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of length *n* that do not change in a list in lexicographic order. Unfortunately, his friend Tamaki Suoh lost this list. Kyoya wishes to reproduce the list and he needs your help. Given the integers *n* and *k*, print the permutation that was *k*-th on Kyoya's list.\nInput specification: The first line will contain two integers *n*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*min*{1018,<=*l*} where *l* is the length of the Kyoya's list).. Output specification: Print *n* space-separated integers, representing the permutation that is the answer for the question.\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n', '10 1\\n'], Demo output: ['1 3 2 4\\n', '1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\\n']\nNote: The standard cycle representation is (1)(32)(4), which after removing parenthesis gives us the original permutation. The first permutation on the list would be [1,\u20092,\u20093,\u20094], while the second permutation would be [1,\u20092,\u20094,\u20093]."}]}}

Each word in his language is an adjective, noun or verb. -  There are two genders: masculine and feminine. Each word in his language has gender either masculine or feminine. -  Masculine adjectives end with -lios, and feminine adjectives end with -liala. -  Masculine nouns end with -etr, and feminime nouns end with -etra. -  Masculine verbs end with -initis, and feminime verbs end with -inites. -  Thus, each word in the Petya's language has one of the six endings, given above. There are no other endings in Petya's language. -  It is accepted that the whole word consists of an ending. That is, words \"lios\", \"liala\", \"etr\" and so on belong to the Petya's language. -  There aren't any punctuation marks, grammatical tenses, singular/plural forms or other language complications. -  A sentence is either exactly one valid language word or exactly one statement. \nStatement is any sequence of the Petya's language, that satisfy both conditions:\n-  Words in statement follow in the following order (from the left to the right): zero or more adjectives followed by exactly one noun followed by zero or more verbs. -  All words in the statement should have the same gender.\nAfter Petya's friend Vasya wrote instant messenger (an instant messaging program) that supported the Petya's language, Petya wanted to add spelling and grammar checking to the program.

Of course, Vova started playing it.\n\nNow he tries to solve a quest. The task is to come to a settlement named Overcity and spread a rumor in it.\n\nVova knows that there are *n* characters in Overcity. Some characters are friends to each other, and they share information they got. Also Vova knows that he can bribe each character so he or she starts spreading the rumor; *i*-th character wants *c**i* gold in exchange for spreading the rumor. When a character hears the rumor, he tells it to all his friends, and they start spreading the rumor to their friends (for free), and so on.\n\nThe quest is finished when all *n* characters know the rumor. What is the minimum amount of gold Vova needs to spend in order to finish the quest?\n\nTake a look at the notes if you think you haven't understood the problem completely.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integer numbers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105,<=0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of characters in Overcity and the number of pairs of friends.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integer numbers *c**i* (0<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the amount of gold *i*-th character asks to start spreading the rumor.\n\nThen *m* lines follow, each containing a pair of numbers (*x**i*,<=*y**i*) which represent that characters *x**i* and *y**i* are friends (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, *x**i*<=\u2260<=*y**i*). It is guaranteed that each pair is listed at most once.. Output specification: Print one number \u2014 the minimum amount of gold Vova has to spend in order to finish the quest.\nDemo input: ['5 2\\n2 5 3 4 8\\n1 4\\n4 5\\n', '10 0\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\\n', '10 5\\n1 6 2 7 3 8 4 9 5 10\\n1 2\\n3 4\\n5 6\\n7 8\\n9 10\\n'], Demo output: ['10\\n', '55\\n', '15\\n']\nNote: In the first example the best decision is to bribe the first character (he will spread the rumor to fourth character, and the fourth one will spread it to fifth). Also Vova has to bribe the second and the third characters, so they know the rumor.\n\nIn the second example Vova has to bribe everyone.\n\nIn the third example the optimal decision is to bribe the first, the third, the fifth, the seventh and the ninth characters."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: The Two-dimensional kingdom is going through hard times... This morning the Three-Dimensional kingdom declared war on the Two-dimensional one. This (possibly armed) conflict will determine the ultimate owner of the straight line.\n\nThe Two-dimensional kingdom has a regular army of *n* people. Each soldier registered himself and indicated the desired size of the bulletproof vest: the *i*-th soldier indicated size *a**i*. The soldiers are known to be unpretentious, so the command staff assumes that the soldiers are comfortable in any vests with sizes from *a**i*<=-<=*x* to *a**i*<=+<=*y*, inclusive (numbers *x*,<=*y*<=\u2265<=0 are specified). \n\nThe Two-dimensional kingdom has *m* vests at its disposal, the *j*-th vest's size equals *b**j*. Help mobilize the Two-dimensional kingdom's army: equip with vests as many soldiers as possible. Each vest can be used only once. The *i*-th soldier can put on the *j*-th vest, if *a**i*<=-<=*x*<=\u2264<=*b**j*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=+<=*y*.\nInput specification: The first input line contains four integers *n*, *m*, *x* and *y* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105, 0<=\u2264<=*x*,<=*y*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the number of soldiers, the number of vests and two numbers that specify the soldiers' unpretentiousness, correspondingly.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109) in non-decreasing order, separated by single spaces \u2014 the desired sizes of vests. \n\nThe third line contains *m* integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**j*<=\u2264<=109) in non-decreasing order, separated by single spaces \u2014 the sizes of the available vests..

Pair (*u**i*, *v**i*) means that soldier number *u**i* must wear vest number *v**i*. Soldiers and vests are numbered starting from one in the order in which they are specified in the input. All numbers of soldiers in the pairs should be pairwise different, all numbers of vests in the pairs also should be pairwise different.

Its peculiarity can be explained in following way: there are *n* inflorescences, numbered from 1 to *n*. Inflorescence number 1 is situated near base of tree and any other inflorescence with number *i* (*i*<=&gt;<=1) is situated at the top of branch, which bottom is *p**i*-th inflorescence and *p**i*<=&lt;<=*i*.\n\nOnce tree starts fruiting, there appears exactly one apple in each inflorescence.

Apples that end up in first inflorescence are gathered by Arcady in exactly the same moment. Second peculiarity of this tree is that once two apples are in same inflorescence they annihilate. This happens with each pair of apples, e.g. if there are 5 apples in same inflorescence in same time, only one will not be annihilated and if there are 8 apples, all apples will be annihilated. Thus, there can be no more than one apple in each inflorescence in each moment of time.\n\nHelp Arcady with counting number of apples he will be able to collect from first inflorescence during one harvest.\nInput specification: First line of input contains single integer number *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000) \u00a0\u2014 number of inflorescences.\n\nSecond line of input contains sequence of *n*<=-<=1 integer numbers *p*2,<=*p*3,<=...,<=*p**n* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=&lt;<=*i*), where *p**i* is number of inflorescence into which the apple from *i*-th inflorescence rolls down.. Output specification: Single line of output should contain one integer number: amount of apples that Arcady will be able to collect from first inflorescence during one harvest.\nDemo input: ['3\\n1 1\\n', '5\\n1 2 2 2\\n', '18\\n1 1 1 4 4 3 2 2 2 10 8 9 9 9 10 10 4\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '3\\n', '4\\n']\nNote: In first example Arcady will be able to collect only one apple, initially situated in 1st inflorescence. In next second apples from 2nd and 3rd inflorescences will roll down and annihilate, and Arcady won't be able to collect them.\n\nIn the second example Arcady will be able to collect 3 apples. First one is one initially situated in first inflorescence. In a second apple from 2nd inflorescence will roll down to 1st (Arcady will collect it) and apples from 3rd, 4th, 5th inflorescences will roll down to 2nd. Two of them will annihilate and one not annihilated will roll down from 2-nd inflorescence to 1st one in the next second and Arcady will collect it."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective. You are able to cope with it not worse, aren't you?\nInput specification: The first and single line contains two integers *A* and *B* (1<=\u2264<=*A*,<=*B*<=\u2264<=109,<=*min*(*A*,<=*B*)<=\u2264<=12)..

His current work task is to create a search engine for the website of the company. During the development process, he needs to write a subroutine for comparing strings *S* and *T* of equal length to be \"similar\". After a brief search on the Internet, he learned about the Hamming distance between two strings *S* and *T* of the same length, which is defined as the number of positions in which *S* and *T* have different characters. For example, the Hamming distance between words \"permanent\" and \"pergament\" is two, as these words differ in the fourth and sixth letters.\n\nMoreover, as he was searching for information, he also noticed that modern search engines have powerful mechanisms to correct errors in the request to improve the quality of search. Ford doesn't know much about human beings, so he assumed that the most common mistake in a request is swapping two arbitrary letters of the string (not necessarily adjacent). Now he wants to write a function that determines which two letters should be swapped in string *S*, so that the Hamming distance between a new string *S* and string *T* would be as small as possible, or otherwise, determine that such a replacement cannot reduce the distance between the strings.\n\nHelp him do this!\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200<=000) \u2014 the length of strings *S* and *T*.\n\nThe second line contains string *S*.\n\nThe third line contains string *T*.\n\nEach of the lines only contains lowercase Latin letters..

For example, after letter 'c' can't go letters 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd', but can go letters 'e', 'f', ..., 'z'.\n\nFor the rocket to fly as far as possible, its weight should be minimal. The weight of the rocket is equal to the sum of the weights of its stages. The weight of the stage is the number of its letter in the alphabet. For example, the stage 'a 'weighs one ton,' b 'weighs two tons, and' z'\u00a0\u2014 $26$ tons.\n\nBuild the rocket with the minimal weight or determine, that it is impossible to build a rocket at all.

Player cuts the cell with the chosen character.

If the first player wins, find the position of character that is optimal to cut in his first move. If there are multiple positions, print the minimal possible one.\nInput specification: The first line contains string *s* (1<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=5000). It is guaranteed that string *s* only contains lowercase English letters.. Output specification: If the second player wins, print in the single line \"Second\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print in the first line \"First\" (without the quotes), and in the second line print the minimal possible winning move \u2014 integer *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=|*s*|).\nDemo input: ['abacaba\\n', 'abcde\\n'], Demo output: ['First\\n2\\n', 'Second\\n']\nNote: In the first sample the first player has multiple winning moves.

It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective. You are able to cope with it not worse, aren't you?\nInput specification: The first and single line contains two integers *A* and *B* (1<=\u2264<=*A*,<=*B*<=\u2264<=109,<=*min*(*A*,<=*B*)<=\u2264<=12).. Output specification: Print a single integer denoting the greatest common divisor of integers *A*! and *B*!.\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n'], Demo output: ['6\\n']\nNote: Consider the sample.\n\n4!\u2009=\u20091\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74\u2009=\u200924. 3!\u2009=\u20091\u00b72\u00b73\u2009=\u20096. The greatest common divisor of integers 24 and 6 is exactly 6."}]}}

Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.\n\nFor example:\n -  the following words have typos: \"hellno\", \"hackcerrs\" and \"backtothefutttture\"; -  the following words don't have typos: \"helllllooooo\", \"tobeornottobe\" and \"oooooo\". \nWhen Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.\n\nImplement this feature of Beroffice editor.

As a result, after $m$ such cuts, there will be $m+1$ parts in total.

Write a python script for the following problem: Natasha is going to fly on a rocket to Mars and return to Earth. Also, on the way to Mars, she will land on $n - 2$ intermediate planets. Formally: we number all the planets from $1$ to $n$. $1$ is Earth, $n$ is Mars. Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt. Assume, that the rocket takes off and lands instantly.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 number of planets.\n\nThe second line contains the only integer $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 weight of the payload.\n\nThe third line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$), where $a_i$ is the number of tons, which can be lifted off by one ton of fuel.\n\nThe fourth line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le 1000$), where $b_i$ is the number of tons, which can be landed by one ton of fuel. \n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel.. Output specification: If Natasha can fly to Mars through $(n - 2)$ planets and return to Earth, print the minimum mass of fuel (in tons) that Natasha should take. Otherwise, print a single number $-1$.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel.\n\nThe answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $10^{-6}$. Formally, let your answer be $p$, and the jury's answer be $q$. Your answer is considered correct if $\\frac{|p - q|}{\\max{(1, |q|)}} \\le 10^{-6}$.\nDemo input: ['2\\n12\\n11 8\\n7 5\\n', '3\\n1\\n1 4 1\\n2 5 3\\n', '6\\n2\\n4 6 3 3 5 6\\n2 6 3 6 5 3\\n'], Demo output: ['10.0000000000\\n', '-1\\n', '85.4800000000\\n']\nNote: Let's consider the first example.\n\nInitially, the mass of a rocket with fuel is $22$ tons.\n-  At take-off from Earth one ton of fuel can lift off $11$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $22$ tons you need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons.-  During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining.-  While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. There will be $14$ tons of rocket with fuel after that.-  During landing on Earth, one ton of fuel can land $7$ tons of cargo, so for landing $14$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight is $12$ tons, that is, a rocket without any fuel.\nIn the second case, the rocket will not be able even to take off from Earth."}]}}

Position (*i*,<=*j*) in the statement is a chessboard cell on the intersection of the *i*-th row and the *j*-th column. You can consider that the corners are: (1,<=*m*), (*n*,<=1), (*n*,<=*m*), (1,<=1).. Output specification: In a single line print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of moves needed to get the candy.\n\nIf Inna and the pony cannot get the candy playing by Dima's rules, print on a single line \"Poor Inna and pony!\" without the quotes.\nDemo input: ['5 7 1 3 2 2\\n', '5 5 2 3 1 1\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', 'Poor Inna and pony!\\n']\nNote: Note to sample 1:\n\nInna and the pony can move the candy to position (1\u2009+\u20092,\u20093\u2009+\u20092)\u2009=\u2009(3,\u20095), from there they can move it to positions (3\u2009-\u20092,\u20095\u2009+\u20092)\u2009=\u2009(1,\u20097) and (3\u2009+\u20092,\u20095\u2009+\u20092)\u2009=\u2009(5,\u20097).

Write a python script for the following problem: Peterson loves to learn new languages, but his favorite hobby is making new ones. Language is a set of words, and word is a sequence of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nPeterson makes new language every morning. It is difficult task to store the whole language, so Peterson have invented new data structure for storing his languages which is called broom. Broom is rooted tree with edges marked with letters. Initially broom is represented by the only vertex\u00a0\u2014 the root of the broom. When Peterson wants to add new word to the language he stands at the root and processes the letters of new word one by one. Consider that Peterson stands at the vertex *u*. If there is an edge from *u* marked with current letter, Peterson goes through this edge. Otherwise Peterson adds new edge from *u* to the new vertex *v*, marks it with the current letter and goes through the new edge. Size of broom is the number of vertices in it.\n\nIn the evening after working day Peterson can't understand the language he made this morning. It is too difficult for bored Peterson and he tries to make it simpler. Simplification of the language is the process of erasing some letters from some words of this language. Formally, Peterson takes some positive integer *p* and erases *p*-th letter from all the words of this language having length at least *p*. Letters in words are indexed starting by 1. Peterson considers that simplification should change at least one word, i.e. there has to be at least one word of length at least *p*. Peterson tries to make his language as simple as possible, so he wants to choose *p* such that the size of the broom for his simplified language is as small as possible.\n\nPeterson is pretty annoyed with this task so he asks you for help. Write a program to find the smallest possible size of the broom and integer *p*.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the broom.\n\nNext *n*<=-<=1 lines describe the broom: *i*-th of them contains integers *u**i*, *v**i* and letter *x**i*\u00a0\u2014 describing the edge from *u**i* to *v**i* marked with letter *x**i*.\n\nVertices are numbered from 1 to *n*. All *x**i* are lowercase latin letters. Vertex 1 is the root of the broom.\n\nEdges describe correct broom which is made from Peterson's language..

Write a python script for the following problem: Little Artem likes electronics. He can spend lots of time making different schemas and looking for novelties in the nearest electronics store. The new control element was delivered to the store recently and Artem immediately bought it.\n\nThat element can store information about the matrix of integers size *n*<=\u00d7<=*m*. There are *n*<=+<=*m* inputs in that element, i.e. each row and each column can get the signal. When signal comes to the input corresponding to some row, this row cyclically shifts to the left, that is the first element of the row becomes last element, second element becomes first and so on. When signal comes to the input corresponding to some column, that column shifts cyclically to the top, that is first element of the column becomes last element, second element becomes first and so on. Rows are numbered with integers from 1 to *n* from top to bottom, while columns are numbered with integers from 1 to *m* from left to right.\n\nArtem wants to carefully study this element before using it. For that purpose he is going to set up an experiment consisting of *q* turns. On each turn he either sends the signal to some input or checks what number is stored at some position of the matrix.\n\nArtem has completed his experiment and has written down the results, but he has lost the chip! Help Artem find any initial matrix that will match the experiment results. It is guaranteed that experiment data is consistent, which means at least one valid matrix exists.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains three integers *n*, *m* and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100,<=1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=10<=000)\u00a0\u2014 dimensions of the matrix and the number of turns in the experiment, respectively.\n\nNext *q* lines contain turns descriptions, one per line. Each description starts with an integer *t**i* (1<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=3) that defines the type of the operation. For the operation of first and second type integer *r**i* (1<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) or *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=*m*) follows, while for the operations of the third type three integers *r**i*, *c**i* and *x**i* (1<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, 1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=*m*, <=-<=109<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=109) are given.\n\nOperation of the first type (*t**i*<==<=1) means that signal comes to the input corresponding to row *r**i*, that is it will shift cyclically. Operation of the second type (*t**i*<==<=2) means that column *c**i* will shift cyclically. Finally, operation of the third type means that at this moment of time cell located in the row *r**i* and column *c**i* stores value *x**i*..

Of course, the round can also have problems with other complexities.\n\nGeorge has a poor imagination. It's easier for him to make some already prepared problem simpler than to come up with a new one and prepare it. George is magnificent at simplifying problems. He can simplify any already prepared problem with complexity *c* to any positive integer complexity *d* (*c*<=\u2265<=*d*), by changing limits on the input data.\n\nHowever, nothing is so simple.

The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:\n 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=\u2264<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* \u2014 *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\nInput specification: The first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it..

Therefore, the uniform's pockets cannot contain coins of denomination more than *r**i*. The rector also does not carry coins of denomination less than *l**i* in his pocket \u2014 because if everyone pays him with so small coins, they gather a lot of weight and the pocket tears. Therefore, a donation can be paid only by coins of denomination *x* berubleys, where *l**i*<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*r**i* (Berland uses coins of any positive integer denomination). Alexey can use the coins of different denominations and he can use the coins of the same denomination any number of times. When Alexey was first confronted with such orders, he was puzzled because it turned out that not all universities can accept him! Alexey is very afraid of going into the army (even though he had long wanted to get the green uniform, but his dad says that the army bullies will beat his son and he cannot pay to ensure the boy's safety). So, Alexey wants to know for sure which universities he can enter so that he could quickly choose his alma mater.\n\nThanks to the parents, Alexey is not limited in money and we can assume that he has an unlimited number of coins of each type.\n\nIn other words, you are given *t* requests, each of them contains numbers *n**i*,<=*l**i*,<=*r**i*. For each query you need to answer, whether it is possible to gather the sum of exactly *n**i* berubleys using only coins with an integer denomination from *l**i* to *r**i* berubleys. You can use coins of different denominations. Coins of each denomination can be used any number of times.\nInput specification: The first line contains the number of universities *t*, (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=1000) Each of the next *t* lines contain three space-separated integers: *n**i*,<=*l**i*,<=*r**i* (1<=\u2264<=*n**i*,<=*l**i*,<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=109;\u00a0*l**i*<=\u2264<=*r**i*).. Output specification: For each query print on a single line: either \"Yes\", if Alexey can enter the university, or \"No\" otherwise.\nDemo input: ['2\\n5 2 3\\n6 4 5\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\nNo\\n']\nNote: You can pay the donation to the first university with two coins: one of denomination 2 and one of denomination 3 berubleys. The donation to the second university cannot be paid."}]}}

Fortunately, the scouts captured an enemy in the morning, who had a secret encrypted message with the information the berlanders needed so much.\n\nThe captured enemy had an array of positive integers. Berland intelligence have long been aware of the flatland code: to convey the message, which contained a number *m*, the enemies use an array of integers *a*. The number of its subarrays, in which there are at least *k* equal numbers, equals *m*. The number *k* has long been known in the Berland army so General Touristov has once again asked Corporal Vasya to perform a simple task: to decipher the flatlanders' message.\n\nHelp Vasya, given an array of integers *a* and number *k*, find the number of subarrays of the array of numbers *a*, which has at least *k* equal numbers.\n\nSubarray *a*[*i*... *j*]\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*j*<=\u2264<=*n*) of array *a*<==<=(*a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*) is an array, made from its consecutive elements, starting from the *i*-th one and ending with the *j*-th one: *a*[*i*... *j*]<==<=(*a**i*,<=*a**i*<=+<=1,<=...,<=*a**j*).\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=4\u00b7105), showing how many numbers an array has and how many equal numbers the subarrays are required to have, correspondingly. \n\nThe second line contains *n* space-separated integers *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 elements of the array.. Output specification: Print the single number \u2014 the number of such subarrays of array *a*, that they have at least *k* equal integers.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. In is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nDemo input: ['4 2\\n1 2 1 2\\n', '5 3\\n1 2 1 1 3\\n', '3 1\\n1 1 1\\n'], Demo output: ['3', '2', '6']\nNote: In the first sample are three subarrays, containing at least two equal numbers: (1,2,1), (2,1,2) and (1,2,1,2).\n\nIn the second sample are two subarrays, containing three equal numbers: (1,2,1,1,3) and (1,2,1,1).\n\nIn the third sample any subarray contains at least one 1 number. Overall they are 6: (1), (1), (1), (1,1), (1,1) and (1,1,1)."}]}}

In case there are less than *k* messages somewhere, they are yet all shown.\n\nDigging deep into your message history, you always read all visible messages and then go by the link in the current message *x* (if there is one) and continue reading in the same manner.\n\nDetermine the number of messages you'll read if your start from message number *t* for all *t* from 1 to *n*. Calculate these numbers independently. If you start with message *x*, the initial configuration is *x* itself, *k* previous and *k* next messages. Messages read multiple times are considered as one.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the total amount of messages and the number of previous and next messages visible.\n\nThe second line features a sequence of integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=&lt;<=*i*), where *a**i* denotes the *i*-th message link destination or zero, if there's no link from *i*. All messages are listed in chronological order. It's guaranteed that the link from message *x* goes to message with number strictly less than *x*.. Output specification: Print *n* integers with *i*-th denoting the number of distinct messages you can read starting from message *i* and traversing the links while possible.\nDemo input: ['6 0\\n0 1 1 2 3 2\\n', '10 1\\n0 1 0 3 4 5 2 3 7 0\\n', '2 2\\n0 1\\n'], Demo output: ['1 2 2 3 3 3 \\n', '2 3 3 4 5 6 6 6 8 2 \\n', '2 2 \\n']\nNote: Consider *i*\u2009=\u20096 in sample case one. You will read message 6, then 2, then 1 and then there will be no link to go.\n\nIn the second sample case *i*\u2009=\u20096 gives you messages 5,\u20096,\u20097 since *k*\u2009=\u20091, then 4,\u20095,\u20096, then 2,\u20093,\u20094 and then the link sequence breaks. The number of distinct messages here is equal to 6."}]}}

We can denote sections with pairs of integers $(i, j)$, where $i$ is the floor, and $j$ is the section number on the floor.\n\nThe guests can walk along the corridor on each floor, use stairs and elevators. Each stairs or elevator occupies all sections $(1, x)$, $(2, x)$, $\\ldots$, $(n, x)$ for some $x$ between $1$ and $m$. All sections not occupied with stairs or elevators contain guest rooms. It takes one time unit to move between neighboring sections on the same floor or to move one floor up or down using stairs. It takes one time unit to move up to $v$ floors in any direction using an elevator.

Write a python script for the following problem: Sherlock Holmes found a mysterious correspondence of two VIPs and made up his mind to read it. But there is a problem! The correspondence turned out to be encrypted. The detective tried really hard to decipher the correspondence, but he couldn't understand anything. \n\nAt last, after some thought, he thought of something. Let's say there is a word *s*, consisting of |*s*| lowercase Latin letters. Then for one operation you can choose a certain position *p* (1<=\u2264<=*p*<=&lt;<=|*s*|) and perform one of the following actions: \n -  either replace letter *s**p* with the one that alphabetically follows it and replace letter *s**p*<=+<=1 with the one that alphabetically precedes it; -  or replace letter *s**p* with the one that alphabetically precedes it and replace letter *s**p*<=+<=1 with the one that alphabetically follows it. \nLet us note that letter \"z\" doesn't have a defined following letter and letter \"a\" doesn't have a defined preceding letter. That's why the corresponding changes are not acceptable. If the operation requires performing at least one unacceptable change, then such operation cannot be performed.\n\nTwo words coincide in their meaning iff one of them can be transformed into the other one as a result of zero or more operations.\n\nSherlock Holmes needs to learn to quickly determine the following for each word: how many words can exist that coincide in their meaning with the given word, but differs from the given word in at least one character? Count this number for him modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\nInput specification: The input data contains several tests. The first line contains the only integer *t* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the number of tests.\n\nNext *t* lines contain the words, one per line. Each word consists of lowercase Latin letters and has length from 1 to 100, inclusive. Lengths of words can differ.. Output specification: For each word you should print the number of different other words that coincide with it in their meaning \u2014 not from the words listed in the input data, but from all possible words. As the sought number can be very large, print its value modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\nDemo input: ['1\\nab\\n', '1\\naaaaaaaaaaa\\n', '2\\nya\\nklmbfxzb\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '0\\n', '24\\n320092793\\n']\nNote: Some explanations about the operation:\n -  Note that for each letter, we can clearly define the letter that follows it. Letter \"b\" alphabetically follows letter \"a\", letter \"c\" follows letter \"b\", ..., \"z\" follows letter \"y\". -  Preceding letters are defined in the similar manner: letter \"y\" precedes letter \"z\", ..., \"a\" precedes letter \"b\". -  Note that the operation never changes a word's length. \nIn the first sample you can obtain the only other word \"ba\". In the second sample you cannot obtain any other word, so the correct answer is 0.\n\nConsider the third sample. One operation can transform word \"klmbfxzb\" into word \"klmcexzb\": we should choose *p*\u2009=\u20094, and replace the fourth letter with the following one (\"b\" \u2009\u2192\u2009 \"c\"), and the fifth one \u2014 with the preceding one (\"f\" \u2009\u2192\u2009 \"e\"). Also, we can obtain many other words from this one. An operation can transform word \"ya\" only into one other word \"xb\". \n\nWord \"ya\" coincides in its meaning with words \"xb\", \"wc\", \"vd\", ..., \"ay\" (overall there are 24 other words). The word \"klmbfxzb has many more variants \u2014 there are 3320092814 other words that coincide with in the meaning. So the answer for the first word equals 24 and for the second one equals 320092793 \u2014 the number 3320092814 modulo 10<sup class=\"upper-index\">9</sup>\u2009+\u20097"}]}}

Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*.

The field is valid if for each cell: \n -  if there is a digit $k$ in the cell, then exactly $k$ neighboring cells have bombs. -  if the cell is empty, then all neighboring cells have no bombs. \nTwo cells are neighbors if they have a common side or a corner (i.\u00a0e. a cell has at most $8$ neighboring cells).\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 100$) \u2014 the sizes of the field.\n\nThe next $n$ lines contain the description of the field. Each line contains $m$ characters, each of them is \".\" (if this cell is empty), \"*\" (if there is bomb in this cell), or a digit from $1$ to $8$, inclusive..

Xenia is currently studying bit operations. To better understand how they work, Xenia decided to calculate some value *v* for *a*.\n\nNamely, it takes several iterations to calculate value *v*. At the first iteration, Xenia writes a new sequence *a*1\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*2,<=*a*3\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*4,<=...,<=*a*2*n*<=-<=1\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*2*n*, consisting of 2*n*<=-<=1 elements. In other words, she writes down the bit-wise OR of adjacent elements of sequence *a*. At the second iteration, Xenia writes the bitwise exclusive OR of adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the first iteration. At the third iteration Xenia writes the bitwise OR of the adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the second iteration. And so on; the operations of bitwise exclusive OR and bitwise OR alternate. In the end, she obtains a sequence consisting of one element, and that element is *v*.\n\nLet's consider an example.

The result is *v*<==<=4.\n\nYou are given Xenia's initial sequence. But to calculate value *v* for a given sequence would be too easy, so you are given additional *m* queries. Each query is a pair of integers *p*,<=*b*. Query *p*,<=*b* means that you need to perform the assignment *a**p*<==<=*b*.

Write a python script for the following problem: *T* is a complete binary tree consisting of *n* vertices. It means that exactly one vertex is a root, and each vertex is either a leaf (and doesn't have children) or an inner node (and has exactly two children). All leaves of a complete binary tree have the same depth (distance from the root). So *n* is a number such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nIn the picture you can see a complete binary tree with *n*<==<=15.\n\nVertices are numbered from 1 to *n* in a special recursive way: we recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the left subtree (if current vertex is not a leaf), then assign a number to the current vertex, and then recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the right subtree (if it exists). In the picture vertices are numbered exactly using this algorithm. It is clear that for each size of a complete binary tree exists exactly one way to give numbers to all vertices. This way of numbering is called symmetric.\n\nYou have to write a program that for given *n* answers *q* queries to the tree.\n\nEach query consists of an integer number *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) and a string *s**i*, where *u**i* is the number of vertex, and *s**i* represents the path starting from this vertex. String *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U', which mean traverse to the left child, to the right child and to the parent, respectively. Characters from *s**i* have to be processed from left to right, considering that *u**i* is the vertex where the path starts. If it's impossible to process a character (for example, to go to the left child of a leaf), then you have to skip it. The answer is the number of vertex where the path represented by *s**i* ends.\n\nFor example, if *u**i*<==<=4 and *s**i*<==<=\u00abUURL\u00bb, then the answer is 10.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integer numbers *n* and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1018, *q*<=\u2265<=1). *n* is such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nThe next 2*q* lines represent queries; each query consists of two consecutive lines. The first of these two lines contains *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*), the second contains non-empty string *s**i*. *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of *s**i* (for each *i* such that 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*q*) doesn't exceed 105..

Every time he starts brooding he can no longer fully concentrate and repeatedly presses the keys that need to be pressed only once. For example, instead of the phrase \"how are you\" he can type \"hhoow aaaare yyoouu\". \n\nPolycarp decided to automate the process of correcting such errors. He decided to write a plug-in to the text editor that will remove pairs of identical consecutive letters (if there are any in the text). Of course, this is not exactly what Polycarp needs, but he's got to start from something! \n\nHelp Polycarp and write the main plug-in module. Your program should remove from a string all pairs of identical letters, which are consecutive. If after the removal there appear new pairs, the program should remove them as well. Technically, its work should be equivalent to the following: while the string contains a pair of consecutive identical letters, the pair should be deleted. Note that deleting of the consecutive identical letters can be done in any order, as any order leads to the same result.\nInput specification: The input data consists of a single line to be processed.

Write a python script for the following problem: Polar bears Menshykov and Uslada from the zoo of St. Petersburg and elephant Horace from the zoo of Kiev decided to build a house of cards. For that they've already found a hefty deck of *n* playing cards. Let's describe the house they want to make: \n 1.  The house consists of some non-zero number of floors. 1.  Each floor consists of a non-zero number of rooms and the ceiling. A room is two cards that are leaned towards each other. The rooms are made in a row, each two adjoining rooms share a ceiling made by another card. 1.  Each floor besides for the lowest one should contain less rooms than the floor below. \nPlease note that the house may end by the floor with more than one room, and in this case they also must be covered by the ceiling. Also, the number of rooms on the adjoining floors doesn't have to differ by one, the difference may be more. \n\nWhile bears are practicing to put cards, Horace tries to figure out how many floors their house should consist of. The height of the house is the number of floors in it. It is possible that you can make a lot of different houses of different heights out of *n* cards. It seems that the elephant cannot solve this problem and he asks you to count the number of the distinct heights of the houses that they can make using exactly *n* cards.\nInput specification: The single line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1012) \u2014 the number of cards.. Output specification: Print the number of distinct heights that the houses made of exactly *n* cards can have.\nDemo input: ['13\\n', '6\\n'], Demo output: ['1', '0']\nNote: In the first sample you can build only these two houses (remember, you must use all the cards):\n\nThus, 13 cards are enough only for two floor houses, so the answer is 1.\n\nThe six cards in the second sample are not enough to build any house."}]}}

Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.\n\nAs input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java. Don't use the function input() in Python2 instead of it use the function raw_input().\nInput specification: The first line contains a non-negative integer *a*.\n\nThe second line contains a non-negative integer *b*.\n\nThe numbers *a*,<=*b* may contain leading zeroes. Each of them contains no more than 106 digits.. Output specification: Print the symbol \"&lt;\" if *a*<=&lt;<=*b* and the symbol \"&gt;\" if *a*<=&gt;<=*b*. If the numbers are equal print the symbol \"=\".\nDemo input: ['9\\n10\\n', '11\\n10\\n', '00012345\\n12345\\n', '0123\\n9\\n', '0123\\n111\\n'], Demo output: ['&lt;\\n', '&gt;\\n', '=\\n', '&gt;\\n', '&gt;\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: This is an interactive problem. In the output section below you will see the information about flushing the output.\n\nBear Limak thinks of some hidden number\u00a0\u2014 an integer from interval [2,<=100]. Your task is to say if the hidden number is prime or composite.\n\nInteger *x*<=&gt;<=1 is called prime if it has exactly two distinct divisors, 1 and *x*. If integer *x*<=&gt;<=1 is not prime, it's called composite.\n\nYou can ask up to 20 queries about divisors of the hidden number. In each query you should print an integer from interval [2,<=100]. The system will answer \"yes\" if your integer is a divisor of the hidden number. Otherwise, the answer will be \"no\".\n\nFor example, if the hidden number is 14 then the system will answer \"yes\" only if you print 2, 7 or 14.\n\nWhen you are done asking queries, print \"prime\" or \"composite\" and terminate your program.\n\nYou will get the Wrong Answer verdict if you ask more than 20 queries, or if you print an integer not from the range [2,<=100]. Also, you will get the Wrong Answer verdict if the printed answer isn't correct.\n\nYou will get the Idleness Limit Exceeded verdict if you don't print anything (but you should) or if you forget about flushing the output (more info below).\nInput specification: After each query you should read one string from the input. It will be \"yes\" if the printed integer is a divisor of the hidden number, and \"no\" otherwise.. Output specification: Up to 20 times you can ask a query\u00a0\u2014 print an integer from interval [2,<=100] in one line. You have to both print the end-of-line character and flush the output. After flushing you should read a response from the input.\n\nIn any moment you can print the answer \"prime\" or \"composite\" (without the quotes). After that, flush the output and terminate your program.\n\nTo flush you can use (just after printing an integer and end-of-line): \n -  fflush(stdout) in C++; -  System.out.flush() in Java; -  stdout.flush() in Python; -  flush(output) in Pascal; -  See the documentation for other languages. \nHacking. To hack someone, as the input you should print the hidden number\u00a0\u2014 one integer from the interval [2,<=100]. Of course, his/her solution won't be able to read the hidden number from the input.\nDemo input: ['yes\\nno\\nyes\\n', 'no\\nyes\\nno\\nno\\nno\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n80\\n5\\ncomposite\\n', '58\\n59\\n78\\n78\\n2\\nprime\\n']\nNote: The hidden number in the first query is 30. In a table below you can see a better form of the provided example of the communication process.\n\n<img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/ea790051c34ea7d2761cd9b096412ca7c647a173.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\nThe hidden number is divisible by both 2 and 5. Thus, it must be composite. Note that it isn't necessary to know the exact value of the hidden number. In this test, the hidden number is 30.\n\n<img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/35c6952617fa94ec3e0ea8e63aa1c3c49b3ba420.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\n59 is a divisor of the hidden number. In the interval [2,\u2009100] there is only one number with this divisor. The hidden number must be 59, which is prime. Note that the answer is known even after the second query and you could print it then and terminate. Though, it isn't forbidden to ask unnecessary queries (unless you exceed the limit of 20 queries)."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: *T* is a complete binary tree consisting of *n* vertices. It means that exactly one vertex is a root, and each vertex is either a leaf (and doesn't have children) or an inner node (and has exactly two children). All leaves of a complete binary tree have the same depth (distance from the root). So *n* is a number such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nIn the picture you can see a complete binary tree with *n*<==<=15.\n\nVertices are numbered from 1 to *n* in a special recursive way: we recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the left subtree (if current vertex is not a leaf), then assign a number to the current vertex, and then recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the right subtree (if it exists). In the picture vertices are numbered exactly using this algorithm. It is clear that for each size of a complete binary tree exists exactly one way to give numbers to all vertices. This way of numbering is called symmetric.\n\nYou have to write a program that for given *n* answers *q* queries to the tree.\n\nEach query consists of an integer number *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) and a string *s**i*, where *u**i* is the number of vertex, and *s**i* represents the path starting from this vertex. String *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U', which mean traverse to the left child, to the right child and to the parent, respectively. Characters from *s**i* have to be processed from left to right, considering that *u**i* is the vertex where the path starts. If it's impossible to process a character (for example, to go to the left child of a leaf), then you have to skip it. The answer is the number of vertex where the path represented by *s**i* ends.\n\nFor example, if *u**i*<==<=4 and *s**i*<==<=\u00abUURL\u00bb, then the answer is 10.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integer numbers *n* and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1018, *q*<=\u2265<=1). *n* is such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nThe next 2*q* lines represent queries; each query consists of two consecutive lines.

But he decided to at least put in under the tap to be filled with water. The plate can be represented by a parallelepiped *k*<=\u00d7<=*n*<=\u00d7<=*m*, that is, it has *k* layers (the first layer is the upper one), each of which is a rectangle *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* with empty squares ('.') and obstacles ('#'). The water can only be present in the empty squares. The tap is positioned above the square (*x*,<=*y*) of the first layer, it is guaranteed that this square is empty. Every minute a cubical unit of water falls into the plate.

Write a python script for the following problem: There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: \n -  alloc n \u2014 to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; \nThe memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.\n\nThe first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.\nInput specification: The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100;1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *t* \u2014 the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* \u2014 the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.. Output specification: Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession. Output lines should go in the same order in which the operations are processed. Successful procession of alloc operation should return integers, starting with 1, as the identifiers of the allocated blocks.\nDemo input: ['6 10\\nalloc 5\\nalloc 3\\nerase 1\\nalloc 6\\ndefragment\\nalloc 6\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n2\\nNULL\\n3\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}
