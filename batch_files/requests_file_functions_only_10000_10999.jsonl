These developments are encoded and stored in a large safe. The Beaver's teeth are strong enough, so the authorities assured that upon arriving at the place the beaver won't have any problems with opening the safe.\n\nAnd he finishes his aspen sprig and leaves for this important task. Of course, the Beaver arrived at the location without any problems, but alas. He can't open the safe with his strong and big teeth. At this point, the Smart Beaver get a call from the headquarters and learns that opening the safe with the teeth is not necessary, as a reliable source has sent the following information: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes.

Write a python script for the following problem: Galois is one of the strongest chess players of Byteforces. He has even invented a new variant of chess, which he named \u00abPawnChess\u00bb.\n\nThis new game is played on a board consisting of 8 rows and 8 columns. At the beginning of every game some black and white pawns are placed on the board. The number of black pawns placed is not necessarily equal to the number of white pawns placed. \n\nLets enumerate rows and columns with integers from 1 to 8. Rows are numbered from top to bottom, while columns are numbered from left to right. Now we denote as (*r*,<=*c*) the cell located at the row *r* and at the column *c*.\n\nThere are always two players A and B playing the game. Player A plays with white pawns, while player B plays with black ones. The goal of player A is to put any of his pawns to the row 1, while player B tries to put any of his pawns to the row 8. As soon as any of the players completes his goal the game finishes immediately and the succeeded player is declared a winner.\n\nPlayer A moves first and then they alternate turns. On his move player A must choose exactly one white pawn and move it one step upward and player B (at his turn) must choose exactly one black pawn and move it one step down. Any move is possible only if the targeted cell is empty. It's guaranteed that for any scenario of the game there will always be at least one move available for any of the players.\n\nMoving upward means that the pawn located in (*r*,<=*c*) will go to the cell (*r*<=-<=1,<=*c*), while moving down means the pawn located in (*r*,<=*c*) will go to the cell (*r*<=+<=1,<=*c*). Again, the corresponding cell must be empty, i.e. not occupied by any other pawn of any color.\n\nGiven the initial disposition of the board, determine who wins the game if both players play optimally. Note that there will always be a winner due to the restriction that for any game scenario both players will have some moves available.\nInput specification: The input consists of the board description given in eight lines, each line contains eight characters. Character 'B' is used to denote a black pawn, and character 'W' represents a white pawn. Empty cell is marked with '.'. \n\nIt's guaranteed that there will not be white pawns on the first row neither black pawns on the last row.. Output specification: Print 'A' if player A wins the game on the given board, and 'B' if player B will claim the victory. Again, it's guaranteed that there will always be a winner on the given board.\nDemo input: ['........\\n........\\n.B....B.\\n....W...\\n........\\n..W.....\\n........\\n........\\n', '..B.....\\n..W.....\\n......B.\\n........\\n.....W..\\n......B.\\n........\\n........\\n'], Demo output: ['A\\n', 'B\\n']\nNote: In the first sample player A is able to complete his goal in 3 steps by always moving a pawn initially located at (4,\u20095). Player B needs at least 5 steps for any of his pawns to reach the row 8. Hence, player A will be the winner."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: In the spirit of the holidays, Saitama has given Genos two grid paths of length *n* (a weird gift even by Saitama's standards). A grid path is an ordered sequence of neighbouring squares in an infinite grid. Two squares are neighbouring if they share a side.\n\nOne example of a grid path is (0,<=0)<=\u2192<=(0,<=1)<=\u2192<=(0,<=2)<=\u2192<=(1,<=2)<=\u2192<=(1,<=1)<=\u2192<=(0,<=1)<=\u2192<=(<=-<=1,<=1). Note that squares in this sequence might be repeated, i.e. path has self intersections.\n\nMovement within a grid path is restricted to adjacent squares within the sequence. That is, from the *i*-th square, one can only move to the (*i*<=-<=1)-th or (*i*<=+<=1)-th squares of this path. Note that there is only a single valid move from the first and last squares of a grid path. Also note, that even if there is some *j*-th square of the path that coincides with the *i*-th square, only moves to (*i*<=-<=1)-th and (*i*<=+<=1)-th squares are available. For example, from the second square in the above sequence, one can only move to either the first or third squares.\n\nTo ensure that movement is not ambiguous, the two grid paths will not have an alternating sequence of three squares. For example, a contiguous subsequence (0,<=0)<=\u2192<=(0,<=1)<=\u2192<=(0,<=0) cannot occur in a valid grid path.\n\nOne marble is placed on the first square of each grid path. Genos wants to get both marbles to the last square of each grid path. However, there is a catch. Whenever he moves one marble, the other marble will copy its movement if possible. For instance, if one marble moves east, then the other marble will try and move east as well. By try, we mean if moving east is a valid move, then the marble will move east.\n\nMoving north increases the second coordinate by 1, while moving south decreases it by 1. Similarly, moving east increases first coordinate by 1, while moving west decreases it.\n\nGiven these two valid grid paths, Genos wants to know if it is possible to move both marbles to the ends of their respective paths. That is, if it is possible to move the marbles such that both marbles rest on the last square of their respective paths.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1<=000<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the paths.\n\nThe second line of the input contains a string consisting of *n*<=-<=1 characters (each of which is either 'N', 'E', 'S', or 'W')\u00a0\u2014 the first grid path. The characters can be thought of as the sequence of moves needed to traverse the grid path. For example, the example path in the problem statement can be expressed by the string \"NNESWW\".\n\nThe third line of the input contains a string of *n*<=-<=1 characters (each of which is either 'N', 'E', 'S', or 'W')\u00a0\u2014 the second grid path.. Output specification: Print \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible for both marbles to be at the end position at the same time. Print \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise. In both cases, the answer is case-insensitive.\nDemo input: ['7\\nNNESWW\\nSWSWSW\\n', '3\\nNN\\nSS\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, the first grid path is the one described in the statement. Moreover, the following sequence of moves will get both marbles to the end: NNESWWSWSW.\n\nIn the second sample, no sequence of moves can get both marbles to the end."}]}}

If integer *x*<=&gt;<=1 is not prime, it's called composite.\n\nYou can ask up to 20 queries about divisors of the hidden number. In each query you should print an integer from interval [2,<=100]. The system will answer \"yes\" if your integer is a divisor of the hidden number. Otherwise, the answer will be \"no\".\n\nFor example, if the hidden number is 14 then the system will answer \"yes\" only if you print 2, 7 or 14.\n\nWhen you are done asking queries, print \"prime\" or \"composite\" and terminate your program.\n\nYou will get the Wrong Answer verdict if you ask more than 20 queries, or if you print an integer not from the range [2,<=100].

Write a python script for the following problem: Tyndex is again well ahead of the rivals! The reaction to the release of Zoozle Chrome browser was the release of a new browser Tyndex.Brome!\n\nThe popularity of the new browser is growing daily. And the secret is not even the Tyndex.Bar installed (the Tyndex.Bar automatically fills the glass with the finest 1664 cognac after you buy Tyndex.Bottles and insert in into a USB port). It is highly popular due to the well-thought interaction with the user.\n\nLet us take, for example, the system of automatic address correction. Have you entered codehorses instead of codeforces? The gloomy Zoozle Chrome will sadly say that the address does not exist. Tyndex.Brome at the same time will automatically find the closest address and sent you there. That's brilliant!\n\nHow does this splendid function work? That's simple! For each potential address a function of the *F* error is calculated by the following rules:\n -  for every letter *c**i* from the potential address *c* the closest position *j* of the letter *c**i* in the address (*s*) entered by the user is found. The absolute difference |*i*<=-<=*j*| of these positions is added to *F*. So for every *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=|*c*|) the position *j* is chosen such, that *c**i*<==<=*s**j*, and |*i*<=-<=*j*| is minimal possible. -  if no such letter *c**i* exists in the address entered by the user, then the length of the potential address |*c*| is added to *F*. \nAfter the values of the error function have been calculated for all the potential addresses the most suitable one is found. \n\nTo understand the special features of the above described method better, it is recommended to realize the algorithm of calculating the *F* function for an address given by the user and some set of potential addresses. Good luck!\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105,<=1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=105).

The process continues until everybody in the line has a shower.\n\nHaving a shower takes some time, so the students in the line talk as they wait. At each moment of time the students talk in pairs: the (2*i*<=-<=1)-th man in the line (for the current moment) talks with the (2*i*)-th one. \n\nLet's look at this process in more detail. Let's number the people from 1 to 5. Let's assume that the line initially looks as 23154 (person number 2 stands at the beginning of the line). Then, before the shower opens, 2 talks with 3, 1 talks with 5, 4 doesn't talk with anyone. Then 2 enters the shower. While 2 has a shower, 3 and 1 talk, 5 and 4 talk too. Then, 3 enters the shower. While 3 has a shower, 1 and 5 talk, 4 doesn't talk to anyone. Then 1 enters the shower and while he is there, 5 and 4 talk. Then 5 enters the shower, and then 4 enters the shower.\n\nWe know that if students *i* and *j* talk, then the *i*-th student's happiness increases by *g**ij* and the *j*-th student's happiness increases by *g**ji*. Your task is to find such initial order of students in the line that the total happiness of all students will be maximum in the end. Please note that some pair of students may have a talk several times. In the example above students 1 and 5 talk while they wait for the shower to open and while 3 has a shower.\nInput specification: The input consists of five lines, each line contains five space-separated integers: the *j*-th number in the *i*-th line shows *g**ij* (0<=\u2264<=*g**ij*<=\u2264<=105). It is guaranteed that *g**ii*<==<=0 for all *i*.\n\nAssume that the students are numbered from 1 to 5.. Output specification: Print a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible total happiness of the students.\nDemo input: ['0 0 0 0 9\\n0 0 0 0 0\\n0 0 0 0 0\\n0 0 0 0 0\\n7 0 0 0 0\\n', '0 43 21 18 2\\n3 0 21 11 65\\n5 2 0 1 4\\n54 62 12 0 99\\n87 64 81 33 0\\n'], Demo output: ['32\\n', '620\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, the optimal arrangement of the line is 23154. In this case, the total happiness equals:"}]}}

Let's call some TV set redundant if after switching it off the number of integer moments of time when at least one of TV sets is working won't decrease. Luba will be very upset if she has to switch off a non-redundant TV set.\n\nHelp Luba by telling her the index of some redundant TV set. If there is no any, print -1.\nInput specification: The first line contains one integer number *n*\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of TV sets.\n\nThen *n* lines follow, each of them containing two integer numbers *l**i*,<=*r**i*\u00a0(0<=\u2264<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=109) denoting the working time of *i*-th TV set.. Output specification: If there is no any redundant TV set, print -1. Otherwise print the index of any redundant TV set (TV sets are indexed from 1 to *n*).\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['3\\n1 3\\n4 6\\n1 7\\n', '2\\n0 10\\n0 10\\n', '3\\n1 2\\n3 4\\n6 8\\n', '3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 4\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '1\\n', '-1\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: Consider the first sample. Initially all integer moments of time such that at least one TV set is working are from the segment [1;7]. It's easy to see that this segment won't change if we switch off the first TV set (or the second one).\n\nNote that in the fourth sample you can switch off the second TV set, since even without it all integer moments such that any of the TV sets is working denote the segment [1;4]."}]}}

After all, if they succeed in turning sand into lead, lead into gold, and then turning part of the gold into sand again and so on, then it will be possible to start with a small amount of sand and get huge amounts of gold! Even an infinite amount of gold! Hermione Granger, by contrast, was skeptical about that idea. She argues that according to the law of conservation of matter getting an infinite amount of matter, even using magic, is impossible. On the contrary, the amount of matter may even decrease during transformation, being converted to magical energy. Though Hermione's theory seems convincing, Ron won't believe her. As far as Ron is concerned, Hermione made up her law of conservation of matter to stop Harry and Ron wasting their time with this nonsense, and to make them go and do homework instead. That's why Ron has already collected a certain amount of sand for the experiments.

Let\u2019s take 400 grams from the resulting amount of gold turn them back into sand. We get 500 grams of sand and 200 grams of gold. If we apply the same operations to 500 grams of sand again, we can get extra 200 grams of gold every time. Thus, you can get 200, 400, 600 etc. grams of gold, i.e., starting with a finite amount of sand (500 grams), you can get the amount of gold which is greater than any preassigned number.\n\nIn the forth sample it is impossible to get sand, or lead, or gold, applying the spells.\n\nIn the fifth sample an infinitely large amount of gold can be obtained by using only the second spell, which allows you to receive 1 gram of gold out of nothing. Note that if such a second spell is available, then the first and the third one do not affect the answer at all.\n\nThe seventh sample is more interesting. We can also start with a zero amount of sand there. With the aid of the third spell you can get sand out of nothing. We get 10000 grams of sand in this manner. Let's get 100 grams of lead using the first spell 100 times. Then make 1 gram of gold from them. We managed to receive 1 gram of gold, starting with a zero amount of sand! Clearly, in this manner you can get an infinitely large amount of gold."}]}}

Suppose that the specifications of the $j$-th server may be expressed with a single integer number $c_j$ of artificial resource units.\n\nIn order for production to work, it is needed to deploy two services $S_1$ and $S_2$ to process incoming requests using the servers of the department.

The grandmother has a large garden, which can be represented as a rectangle 1<=\u00d7<=*n* in size, when viewed from above. This rectangle is divided into *n* equal square sections. The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.\n\nCreating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section. At that, the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section. That is, for example, the garden can be represented by a 1<=\u00d7<=5 rectangle, where the section heights are equal to 4, 2, 3, 3, 2. Then if we create an artificial rain over any of the sections with the height of 3, the water will flow over all the sections, except the ones with the height of 4.

For example, the words ogo, ogogo, ogogogo are fillers, but the words go, og, ogog, ogogog and oggo are not fillers.\n\nThe fillers have maximal size, for example, for ogogoo speech we can't consider ogo a filler and goo as a normal phrase. We should consider ogogo as a filler here.\n\nTo print the interview, Polycarp has to replace each of the fillers with three asterisks. Note that a filler word is replaced with exactly three asterisks regardless of its length.\n\nPolycarp has dealt with this problem in no time. Can you do the same? The clock is ticking!\nInput specification: The first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the interview.\n\nThe second line contains the string *s* of length *n*, consisting of lowercase English letters.. Output specification: Print the interview text after the replacement of each of the fillers with \"***\". It is allowed for the substring \"***\" to have several consecutive occurences.\nDemo input: ['7\\naogogob\\n', '13\\nogogmgogogogo\\n', '9\\nogoogoogo\\n'], Demo output: ['a***b\\n', '***gmg***\\n', '*********\\n']\nNote: The first sample contains one filler word ogogo, so the interview for printing is \"a***b\".\n\nThe second sample contains two fillers ogo and ogogogo. Thus, the interview is transformed to \"***gmg***\"."}]}}

The education is not easy because you need to have fundamental knowledge in different areas, which sometimes are not related to each other. \n\nFor example, you should know linguistics very well. You learn a structure of Reberland language as foreign language. In this language words are constructed according to the following rules. First you need to choose the \"root\" of the word \u2014 some string which has more than 4 letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3 symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction \u2014  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row.

You are given the word *s*. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language. \n\nTwo strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match. \n\nLet's look at the example: the word *abacabaca* is given.

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, Dima met with Sasha in a philatelic store, and since then they are collecting coins together. Their favorite occupation is to sort collections of coins. Sasha likes having things in order, that is why he wants his coins to be arranged in a row in such a way that firstly come coins out of circulation, and then come coins still in circulation. \n\nFor arranging coins Dima uses the following algorithm. One step of his algorithm looks like the following:\n 1.  He looks through all the coins from left to right; 1.  If he sees that the *i*-th coin is still in circulation, and (*i*<=+<=1)-th coin is already out of circulation, he exchanges these two coins and continues watching coins from (*i*<=+<=1)-th. \nDima repeats the procedure above until it happens that no two coins were exchanged during this procedure. Dima calls hardness of ordering the number of steps required for him according to the algorithm above to sort the sequence, e.g. the number of times he looks through the coins from the very beginning. For example, for the ordered sequence hardness of ordering equals one.\n\nToday Sasha invited Dima and proposed him a game. First he puts *n* coins in a row, all of them are out of circulation. Then Sasha chooses one of the coins out of circulation and replaces it with a coin in circulation for *n* times. During this process Sasha constantly asks Dima what is the hardness of ordering of the sequence. \n\nThe task is more complicated because Dima should not touch the coins and he should determine hardness of ordering in his mind.

On the plan the garden is represented as a rectangular checkered field *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* in size divided into squares whose side length is 1.

Write a python script for the following problem: There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: \n -  alloc n \u2014 to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; \nThe memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.\n\nThe first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.\nInput specification: The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100;1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *t* \u2014 the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* \u2014 the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.. Output specification: Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession. Output lines should go in the same order in which the operations are processed.

Write a python script for the following problem: After the big birthday party, Katie still wanted Shiro to have some more fun. Later, she came up with a game called treasure hunt. Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\n\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.. Output specification: Print the name of the winner (\"Kuro\", \"Shiro\" or \"Katie\"). If there are at least two cats that share the maximum beauty, print \"Draw\".\nDemo input: ['3\\nKuroo\\nShiro\\nKatie\\n', '7\\ntreasurehunt\\nthreefriends\\nhiCodeforces\\n', '1\\nabcabc\\ncbabac\\nababca\\n', '15\\nfoPaErcvJ\\nmZaxowpbt\\nmkuOlaHRE\\n'], Demo output: ['Kuro\\n', 'Shiro\\n', 'Katie\\n', 'Draw\\n']\nNote: In the first example, after $3$ turns, Kuro can change his ribbon into ooooo, which has the beauty of $5$, while reaching such beauty for Shiro and Katie is impossible (both Shiro and Katie can reach the beauty of at most $4$, for example by changing Shiro's ribbon into SSiSS and changing Katie's ribbon into Kaaaa). Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice. Therefore, the game ends in a draw."}]}}

During each round a player gains or loses a particular number of points. In the course of the game the number of points is registered in the line \"name score\", where name is a player's name, and score is the number of points gained in this round, which is an integer number. If score is negative, this means that the player has lost in the round. So, if two or more players have the maximum number of points (say, it equals to *m*) at the end of the game, than wins the one of them who scored at least *m* points first.

Write a python script for the following problem: By 2312 there were *n* Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*)..

Hitagi's sequence has been broken for a long time, but now Kaiki provides an opportunity.\n\nHitagi's sequence *a* has a length of *n*. Lost elements in it are denoted by zeros. Kaiki provides another sequence *b*, whose length *k* equals the number of lost elements in *a* (i.e. the number of zeros). Hitagi is to replace each zero in *a* with an element from *b* so that each element in *b* should be used exactly once. Hitagi knows, however, that, apart from 0, no integer occurs in *a* and *b* more than once in total.\n\nIf the resulting sequence is not an increasing sequence, then it has the power to recover Hitagi from the oddity.

In other words, the heights of the trees, standing at equal distance from the edge (of one end of the sequence) must be equal to each other, and with the increasing of the distance from the edge by 1 the tree height must also increase by 1. For example, the sequences \"2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2\" and \"1 2 3 2 1\" are beautiful, and '1 3 3 1\" and \"1 2 3 1\" are not. \n\nChanging the height of a tree is a very expensive operation, using advanced technologies invented by Berland scientists.

Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*)..

The first character of the slogan must be in the first square (the leftmost) of the poster, the second character must be in the second square, and so on.\n\nOf course, the R1 programmers want to write the slogan on the poster themselves. To do this, they have a large (and a very heavy) ladder which was put exactly opposite the *k*-th square of the poster. To draw the *i*-th character of the slogan on the poster, you need to climb the ladder, standing in front of the *i*-th square of the poster. This action (along with climbing up and down the ladder) takes one hour for a painter. The painter is not allowed to draw characters in the adjacent squares when the ladder is in front of the *i*-th square because the uncomfortable position of the ladder may make the characters untidy. Besides, the programmers can move the ladder. In one hour, they can move the ladder either a meter to the right or a meter to the left.\n\nDrawing characters and moving the ladder is very tiring, so the programmers want to finish the job in as little time as possible.

The time to enjoy those around them is so little that some even stand in queues to several rooms at the same time in the clinic, running from one queue to another.\n\n(Cultural note: standing in huge and disorganized queues for hours is a native tradition in Russia, dating back to the Soviet period. Queues can resemble crowds rather than lines. Not to get lost in such a queue, a person should follow a strict survival technique: you approach the queue and ask who the last person is, somebody answers and you join the crowd. Now you're the last person in the queue till somebody else shows up. You keep an eye on the one who was last before you as he is your only chance to get to your destination) I'm sure many people have had the problem when a stranger asks who the last person in the queue is and even dares to hint that he will be the last in the queue and then bolts away to some unknown destination. These are the representatives of the modern world, in which the ratio of lack of time is so great that they do not even watch foreign top-rated TV series.

If the beaver did not know his correct position in the queue, then it might be his turn to go get an ECG, or maybe he should wait for a long, long time...\n\nAs you've guessed, the Smart Beaver was in a hurry home, so he gave you all the necessary information for you to help him to determine what his number in the queue can be.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=103) and *x* (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of beavers that stand in the queue and the Smart Beaver's number, correspondingly.

It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.\n\nNow let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins.

Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too.

The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance!

Each of the stages is defined by a lowercase Latin letter. This way, the rocket can be described by the string\u00a0\u2014 concatenation of letters, which correspond to the stages.\n\nThere are $n$ stages available. The rocket must contain exactly $k$ of them. Stages in the rocket should be ordered by their weight. So, after the stage with some letter can go only stage with a letter, which is at least two positions after in the alphabet (skipping one letter in between, or even more). For example, after letter 'c' can't go letters 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd', but can go letters 'e', 'f', ..., 'z'.\n\nFor the rocket to fly as far as possible, its weight should be minimal. The weight of the rocket is equal to the sum of the weights of its stages. The weight of the stage is the number of its letter in the alphabet. For example, the stage 'a 'weighs one ton,' b 'weighs two tons, and' z'\u00a0\u2014 $26$ tons.\n\nBuild the rocket with the minimal weight or determine, that it is impossible to build a rocket at all.

Its weight is $2+5+12+15=34$.\n\nIn the third example, $n=k=2$, so the rocket must have both stages: 'a' and 'b'.

The *i*-th subarray is described with two integers *l**i* and *r**i*, and its elements are *a*[*l**i*],<=*a*[*l**i*<=+<=1],<=...,<=*a*[*r**i*].\n\nAlyona is going to find mex for each of the chosen subarrays. Among these *m* mexes the girl is going to find the smallest. She wants this minimum mex to be as large as possible. \n\nYou are to find an array *a* of *n* elements so that the minimum mex among those chosen by Alyona subarrays is as large as possible.\n\nThe mex of a set *S* is a minimum possible non-negative integer that is not in *S*.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105).\n\nThe next *m* lines contain information about the subarrays chosen by Alyona.

Its peculiarity can be explained in following way: there are *n* inflorescences, numbered from 1 to *n*. Inflorescence number 1 is situated near base of tree and any other inflorescence with number *i* (*i*<=&gt;<=1) is situated at the top of branch, which bottom is *p**i*-th inflorescence and *p**i*<=&lt;<=*i*.\n\nOnce tree starts fruiting, there appears exactly one apple in each inflorescence. The same moment as apples appear, they start to roll down along branches to the very base of tree. Each second all apples, except ones in first inflorescence simultaneously roll down one branch closer to tree base, e.g. apple in *a*-th inflorescence gets to *p**a*-th inflorescence. Apples that end up in first inflorescence are gathered by Arcady in exactly the same moment. Second peculiarity of this tree is that once two apples are in same inflorescence they annihilate. This happens with each pair of apples, e.g. if there are 5 apples in same inflorescence in same time, only one will not be annihilated and if there are 8 apples, all apples will be annihilated.

Write a python script for the following problem: In Disgaea as in most role-playing games, characters have skills that determine the character's ability to use certain weapons or spells. If the character does not have the necessary skill, he cannot use it. The skill level is represented as an integer that increases when you use this skill. Different character classes are characterized by different skills. \n\nUnfortunately, the skills that are uncommon for the given character's class are quite difficult to obtain. To avoid this limitation, there is the so-called transmigration. \n\nTransmigration is reincarnation of the character in a new creature. His soul shifts to a new body and retains part of his experience from the previous life. \n\nAs a result of transmigration the new character gets all the skills of the old character and the skill levels are reduced according to the *k* coefficient (if the skill level was equal to *x*, then after transmigration it becomes equal to [*kx*], where [*y*] is the integral part of *y*). If some skill's levels are strictly less than 100, these skills are forgotten (the character does not have them any more). After that the new character also gains the skills that are specific for his class, but are new to him. The levels of those additional skills are set to 0. \n\nThus, one can create a character with skills specific for completely different character classes via transmigrations. For example, creating a mage archer or a thief warrior is possible. \n\nYou are suggested to solve the following problem: what skills will the character have after transmigration and what will the levels of those skills be?\nInput specification: The first line contains three numbers *n*, *m* and *k* \u2014 the number of skills the current character has, the number of skills specific for the class into which the character is going to transmigrate and the reducing coefficient respectively; *n* and *m* are integers, and *k* is a real number with exactly two digits after decimal point (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=20, 0.01<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=0.99).\n\nThen follow *n* lines, each of which describes a character's skill in the form \"*name* *exp*\" \u2014 the skill's name and the character's skill level: *name* is a string and *exp* is an integer in range from 0 to 9999, inclusive. \n\nThen follow *m* lines each of which contains names of skills specific for the class, into which the character transmigrates. \n\nAll names consist of lowercase Latin letters and their lengths can range from 1 to 20 characters, inclusive.

Write a python script for the following problem: Petya has recently learned data structure named \"Binary heap\".\n\nThe heap he is now operating with allows the following operations: \n -  put the given number into the heap; -  get the value of the minimum element in the heap; -  extract the minimum element from the heap; \nThus, at any moment of time the heap contains several integers (possibly none), some of them might be equal.\n\nIn order to better learn this data structure Petya took an empty heap and applied some operations above to it. Also, he carefully wrote down all the operations and their results to his event log, following the format: \n -  insert *x*\u00a0\u2014 put the element with value *x* in the heap; -  getMin *x*\u00a0\u2014 the value of the minimum element contained in the heap was equal to *x*; -  removeMin\u00a0\u2014 the minimum element was extracted from the heap (only one instance, if there were many). \nAll the operations were correct, i.e. there was at least one element in the heap each time getMin or removeMin operations were applied.\n\nWhile Petya was away for a lunch, his little brother Vova came to the room, took away some of the pages from Petya's log and used them to make paper boats.\n\nNow Vova is worried, if he made Petya's sequence of operations inconsistent. For example, if one apply operations one-by-one in the order they are written in the event log, results of getMin operations might differ from the results recorded by Petya, and some of getMin or removeMin operations may be incorrect, as the heap is empty at the moment they are applied.\n\nNow Vova wants to add some new operation records to the event log in order to make the resulting sequence of operations correct.

Write a python script for the following problem: One day mum asked Petya to sort his toys and get rid of some of them. Petya found a whole box of toy spiders. They were quite dear to him and the boy didn't want to throw them away. Petya conjured a cunning plan: he will glue all the spiders together and attach them to the ceiling. Besides, Petya knows that the lower the spiders will hang, the more mum is going to like it and then she won't throw his favourite toys away. Help Petya carry out the plan.\n\nA spider consists of *k* beads tied together by *k*<=-<=1 threads. Each thread connects two different beads, at that any pair of beads that make up a spider is either directly connected by a thread, or is connected via some chain of threads and beads.\n\nPetya may glue spiders together directly gluing their beads. The length of each thread equals 1. The sizes of the beads can be neglected. That's why we can consider that gluing spiders happens by identifying some of the beads (see the picture). Besides, the construction resulting from the gluing process should also represent a spider, that is, it should have the given features. \n\nAfter Petya glues all spiders together, he measures the length of the resulting toy. The distance between a pair of beads is identified as the total length of the threads that connect these two beads. The length of the resulting construction is the largest distance between all pairs of beads. Petya wants to make the spider whose length is as much as possible.\n\nThe picture two shows two spiders from the second sample.

He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.\n\nOne day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.\nInput specification: There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number.

Also, he carefully wrote down all the operations and their results to his event log, following the format: \n -  insert *x*\u00a0\u2014 put the element with value *x* in the heap; -  getMin *x*\u00a0\u2014 the value of the minimum element contained in the heap was equal to *x*; -  removeMin\u00a0\u2014 the minimum element was extracted from the heap (only one instance, if there were many). \nAll the operations were correct, i.e. there was at least one element in the heap each time getMin or removeMin operations were applied.\n\nWhile Petya was away for a lunch, his little brother Vova came to the room, took away some of the pages from Petya's log and used them to make paper boats.\n\nNow Vova is worried, if he made Petya's sequence of operations inconsistent. For example, if one apply operations one-by-one in the order they are written in the event log, results of getMin operations might differ from the results recorded by Petya, and some of getMin or removeMin operations may be incorrect, as the heap is empty at the moment they are applied.\n\nNow Vova wants to add some new operation records to the event log in order to make the resulting sequence of operations correct. That is, the result of each getMin operation is equal to the result in the record, and the heap is non-empty when getMin ad removeMin are applied. Vova wants to complete this as fast as possible, as the Petya may get back at any moment. He asks you to add the least possible number of operation records to the current log.

All the numbers in the output should be integers not exceeding 109 by their absolute value.\n\nNote that the input sequence of operations must be the subsequence of the output sequence.\n\nIt's guaranteed that there exists the correct answer consisting of no more than 1<=000<=000 operations.\nDemo input: ['2\\ninsert 3\\ngetMin 4\\n', '4\\ninsert 1\\ninsert 1\\nremoveMin\\ngetMin 2\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\ninsert 3\\nremoveMin\\ninsert 4\\ngetMin 4\\n', '6\\ninsert 1\\ninsert 1\\nremoveMin\\nremoveMin\\ninsert 2\\ngetMin 2\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, after number 3 is inserted into the heap, the minimum number is 3. To make the result of the first getMin equal to 4 one should firstly remove number 3 from the heap and then add number 4 into the heap.\n\nIn the second sample case number 1 is inserted two times, so should be similarly removed twice."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: *T* is a complete binary tree consisting of *n* vertices. It means that exactly one vertex is a root, and each vertex is either a leaf (and doesn't have children) or an inner node (and has exactly two children). All leaves of a complete binary tree have the same depth (distance from the root). So *n* is a number such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nIn the picture you can see a complete binary tree with *n*<==<=15.\n\nVertices are numbered from 1 to *n* in a special recursive way: we recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the left subtree (if current vertex is not a leaf), then assign a number to the current vertex, and then recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the right subtree (if it exists). In the picture vertices are numbered exactly using this algorithm. It is clear that for each size of a complete binary tree exists exactly one way to give numbers to all vertices. This way of numbering is called symmetric.\n\nYou have to write a program that for given *n* answers *q* queries to the tree.\n\nEach query consists of an integer number *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) and a string *s**i*, where *u**i* is the number of vertex, and *s**i* represents the path starting from this vertex. String *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U', which mean traverse to the left child, to the right child and to the parent, respectively.

After a move, the length of the string decreases by $1$. You can't choose a string if it is empty.\n\nFor example:\n -  by applying a move to the string \"where\", the result is the string \"here\", -  by applying a move to the string \"a\", the result is an empty string \"\". \nYou are required to make two given strings equal using the fewest number of moves. It is possible that, in the end, both strings will be equal to the empty string, and so, are equal to each other. In this case, the answer is obviously the sum of the lengths of the initial strings.\n\nWrite a program that finds the minimum number of moves to make two given strings $s$ and $t$ equal.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains $s$. In the second line of the input contains $t$. Both strings consist only of lowercase Latin letters. The number of letters in each string is between 1 and $2\\cdot10^5$, inclusive.. Output specification: Output the fewest number of moves required. It is possible that, in the end, both strings will be equal to the empty string, and so, are equal to each other.

As a result, both strings will be equal to \"est\".\n\nIn the second example, the move should be applied to the string \"codeforces\" $8$ times. As a result, the string becomes \"codeforces\" $\\to$ \"es\". The move should be applied to the string \"yes\" once. The result is the same string \"yes\" $\\to$ \"es\".\n\nIn the third example, you can make the strings equal only by completely deleting them. That is, in the end, both strings will be empty.\n\nIn the fourth example, the first character of the second string should be deleted."}]}}

If the initial picture already has such a square, the person should just say so and the test will be completed. \n\nYour task is to write a program that determines whether it is possible to pass the test. You cannot pass the test if either repainting any cell or no action doesn't result in a 2<=\u00d7<=2 square, consisting of cells of the same color.\nInput specification: Four lines contain four characters each: the *j*-th character of the *i*-th line equals \".\" if the cell in the *i*-th row and the *j*-th column of the square is painted white, and \"#\", if the cell is black.. Output specification: Print \"YES\" (without the quotes), if the test can be passed and \"NO\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\nDemo input: ['####\\n.#..\\n####\\n....\\n', '####\\n....\\n####\\n....\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: In the first test sample it is enough to repaint the first cell in the second row. After such repainting the required 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 square is on the intersection of the 1-st and 2-nd row with the 1-st and 2-nd column."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Bob is a farmer. He has a large pasture with many sheep. Recently, he has lost some of them due to wolf attacks. He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of dogs.\nDemo input: ['6 6\\n..S...\\n..S.W.\\n.S....\\n..W...\\n...W..\\n......\\n', '1 2\\nSW\\n', '5 5\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS....\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n..SD..\\n..SDW.\\n.SD...\\n.DW...\\nDD.W..\\n......\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS.D..\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n']\nNote: In the first example, we can split the pasture into two halves, one containing wolves and one containing sheep. Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Greg the Dwarf has been really busy recently with excavations by the Neverland Mountain. However for the well-known reasons (as you probably remember he is a very unusual dwarf and he cannot stand sunlight) Greg can only excavate at night. And in the morning he should be in his crypt before the first sun ray strikes. That's why he wants to find the shortest route from the excavation point to his crypt. Greg has recollected how the Codeforces participants successfully solved the problem of transporting his coffin to a crypt. So, in some miraculous way Greg appeared in your bedroom and asks you to help him in a highly persuasive manner. As usual, you didn't feel like turning him down.\n\nAfter some thought, you formalized the task as follows: as the Neverland mountain has a regular shape and ends with a rather sharp peak, it can be represented as a cone whose base radius equals *r* and whose height equals *h*. The graveyard where Greg is busy excavating and his crypt can be represented by two points on the cone's surface. All you've got to do is find the distance between points on the cone's surface. \n\nThe task is complicated by the fact that the mountain's base on the ground level and even everything below the mountain has been dug through by gnome (one may wonder whether they've been looking for the same stuff as Greg...). So, one can consider the shortest way to pass not only along the side surface, but also along the cone's base (and in a specific case both points can lie on the cone's base \u2014 see the first sample test)\n\nGreg will be satisfied with the problem solution represented as the length of the shortest path between two points \u2014 he can find his way pretty well on his own. He gave you two hours to solve the problem and the time is ticking!\nInput specification: The first input line contains space-separated integers *r* and *h* (1<=\u2264<=*r*,<=*h*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the base radius and the cone height correspondingly. The second and third lines contain coordinates of two points on the cone surface, groups of three space-separated real numbers. The coordinates of the points are given in the systems of coordinates where the origin of coordinates is located in the centre of the cone's base and its rotation axis matches the *OZ* axis. In this coordinate system the vertex of the cone is located at the point (0,<=0,<=*h*), the base of the cone is a circle whose center is at the point (0,<=0,<=0), lying on the *XOY* plane, and all points on the cone surface have a non-negative coordinate *z*. It is guaranteed that the distances from the points to the cone surface do not exceed 10<=-<=12. All real numbers in the input have no more than 16 digits after decimal point..

Of course, the sleuth knows nothing about it and his task is to understand that.\n\nUnfortunately, Vasya is not very smart. After 5 hours of endless stupid questions everybody except Vasya got bored. That\u2019s why Vasya\u2019s friends ask you to write a program that would give answers instead of them.\n\nThe English alphabet vowels are: A, E, I, O, U, Y\n\nThe English alphabet consonants are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Z\nInput specification: The single line contains a question represented by a non-empty line consisting of large and small Latin letters, spaces and a question mark.

Write a python script for the following problem: Vasya studies music. \n\nHe has learned lots of interesting stuff. For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\n\nVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads \u2014 major and minor.\n\nLet's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes *X*, *Y* and *Z*. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between *X* and *Y* equals 4 semitones and the distance between *Y* and *Z* is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between *X* and *Z*, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.\n\nA minor triad is different in that the distance between *X* and *Y* should be 3 semitones and between *Y* and *Z* \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nFor example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nHelp Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\nInput specification: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.. Output specification: Print \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\nDemo input: ['C E G\\n', 'C# B F\\n', 'A B H\\n'], Demo output: ['major\\n', 'minor\\n', 'strange\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

To get to the floor *f*\u2009=\u20094, he has to wait until the time equals 7, that's the time when the elevator will go upwards for the second time. Then the first participant should get on the elevator and go two floors up. In this case the first participant gets to the floor *f* at time equal to 9. The second participant starts at the time *t*\u2009=\u20090 on the floor *s*\u2009=\u20091, enters the elevator immediately, and arrives to the floor *f*\u2009=\u20092.

Write a python script for the following problem: Ancient Egyptians are known to have used a large set of symbols  to write on the walls of the temples. Fafa and Fifa went to one of the temples and found two non-empty words *S*1 and *S*2 of equal lengths on the wall of temple written one below the other. Since this temple is very ancient, some symbols from the words were erased. The symbols in the set  have equal probability for being in the position of any erased symbol.\n\nFifa challenged Fafa to calculate the probability that *S*1 is lexicographically greater than *S*2. Can you help Fafa with this task?\n\nYou know that , i.\u00a0e. there were *m* distinct characters in Egyptians' alphabet, in this problem these characters are denoted by integers from 1 to *m* in alphabet order. A word *x* is lexicographically greater than a word *y* of the same length, if the words are same up to some position, and then the word *x* has a larger character, than the word *y*.\n\nWe can prove that the probability equals to some fraction , where *P* and *Q* are coprime integers, and . Print as the answer the value , i.\u00a0e. such a non-negative integer less than 109<=+<=7, such that , where  means that *a* and *b* give the same remainders when divided by *m*.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the length of each of the two words and the size of the alphabet , respectively.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*m*) \u2014 the symbols of *S*1.

He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.\n\nOne day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest.

But even in the world of their dreams, while they are snoring peacefully, the sense of impending doom is still upon them.\n\nA poor student is dreaming that he is sitting the mathematical analysis exam. And he is examined by the most formidable professor of all times, a three times Soviet Union Hero, a Noble Prize laureate in student expulsion, venerable Petr Palych.\n\nThe poor student couldn't answer a single question. Thus, instead of a large spacious office he is going to apply for a job to thorium mines. But wait a minute! Petr Palych decided to give the student the last chance! Yes, that is possible only in dreams. \n\nSo the professor began: \"Once a Venusian girl and a Marsian boy met on the Earth and decided to take a walk holding hands. But the problem is the girl has *a**l* fingers on her left hand and *a**r* fingers on the right one. The boy correspondingly has *b**l* and *b**r* fingers. They can only feel comfortable when holding hands, when no pair of the girl's fingers will touch each other. That is, they are comfortable when between any two girl's fingers there is a boy's finger. And in addition, no three fingers of the boy should touch each other. Determine if they can hold hands so that the both were comfortable.\"\n\nThe boy any the girl don't care who goes to the left and who goes to the right. The difference is only that if the boy goes to the left of the girl, he will take her left hand with his right one, and if he goes to the right of the girl, then it is vice versa.\nInput specification: The first line contains two positive integers not exceeding 100. They are the number of fingers on the Venusian girl's left and right hand correspondingly. The second line contains two integers not exceeding 100.

Write a python script for the following problem: After the contest in comparing numbers, Shapur's teacher found out that he is a real genius and that no one could possibly do the calculations faster than him even using a super computer!\n\nSome days before the contest, the teacher took a very simple-looking exam and all his *n* students took part in the exam. The teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation.\n\nUnfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.\n\nNow the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers.\n\nShapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: \n -  As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. -  As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include \"-\", \";\" and \"_\". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. -  The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600 -  My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. -  Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN -  You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong. Do this by writing \"WA\" for Wrong answer or \"ACC\" for a correct answer. -  I should remind you that none of the strings (initial strings or answers) are empty. -  Finally, do these as soon as possible. You have less than 2 hours to complete this.\nInput specification: The first three lines contain a string each. These are the initial strings. They consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). All the initial strings have length from 1 to 100, inclusively.\n\nIn the fourth line there is a single integer *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000), the number of students.\n\nNext *n* lines contain a student's answer each. It is guaranteed that the answer meets what the teacher said. Each answer iconsists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). Length is from 1 to 600, inclusively.. Output specification: For each student write in a different line.

Help him solve this problem.\nInput specification: The input contains four integers *r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2 (1<=\u2264<=*r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2<=\u2264<=8) \u2014 the coordinates of the starting and the final field. The starting field doesn't coincide with the final one.\n\nYou can assume that the chessboard rows are numbered from top to bottom 1 through 8, and the columns are numbered from left to right 1 through 8.. Output specification: Print three space-separated integers: the minimum number of moves the rook, the bishop and the king (in this order) is needed to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2). If a piece cannot make such a move, print a 0 instead of the corresponding number.\nDemo input: ['4 3 1 6\\n', '5 5 5 6\\n'], Demo output: ['2 1 3\\n', '1 0 1\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: In an embassy of a well-known kingdom an electronic queue is organised. Every person who comes to the embassy, needs to make the following three actions: show the ID, pay money to the cashier and be fingerprinted. Besides, the actions should be performed in the given order.\n\nFor each action several separate windows are singled out: *k*1 separate windows for the first action (the first type windows), *k*2 windows for the second one (the second type windows), and *k*3 for the third one (the third type windows). The service time for one person in any of the first type window equals to *t*1. Similarly, it takes *t*2 time to serve a person in any of the second type windows. And it takes *t*3 to serve one person in any of the third type windows. Thus, the service time depends only on the window type and is independent from the person who is applying for visa.\n\nAt some moment *n* people come to the embassy, the *i*-th person comes at the moment of time *c**i*. The person is registered under some number. After that he sits in the hall and waits for his number to be shown on a special board. Besides the person's number the board shows the number of the window where one should go and the person goes there immediately. Let's consider that the time needed to approach the window is negligible. The table can show information for no more than one person at a time. The electronic queue works so as to immediately start working with the person who has approached the window, as there are no other people in front of the window.\n\nThe Client Service Quality inspectors noticed that several people spend too much time in the embassy (this is particularly tiresome as the embassy has no mobile phone reception and 3G). It was decided to organise the system so that the largest time a person spends in the embassy were minimum. Help the inspectors organise the queue. Consider that all actions except for being served in at the window, happen instantly.\nInput specification: The first line contains three space-separated integers *k*1, *k*2, *k*3 (1<=\u2264<=*k**i*<=\u2264<=109), they are the number of windows of the first, second and third type correspondingly.\n\nThe second line contains three space-separated integers *t*1, *t*2, *t*3 (1<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=105), they are the periods of time needed to serve one person in the window of the first, second and third type correspondingly. \n\nThe third line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105), it is the number of people.\n\nThe fourth line contains *n* space-separated integers *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=109) in the non-decreasing order; *c**i* is the time when the person number *i* comes to the embassy.. Output specification: Print the single number, the maximum time a person will spend in the embassy if the queue is organized optimally.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams (also you may use the %I64d specificator).\nDemo input: ['1 1 1\\n1 1 1\\n5\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n', '2 1 1\\n5 1 1\\n5\\n1 2 3 3 5\\n'], Demo output: ['7\\n', '13\\n']\nNote: In the first test 5 people come simultaneously at the moment of time equal to 1. There is one window of every type, it takes 1 unit of time to be served at each window. That's why the maximal time a person spends in the embassy is the time needed to be served at the windows (3 units of time) plus the time the last person who comes to the first window waits (4 units of time).\n\n Windows in the second test work like this:\n\nThe first window of the first type: [1,\u20096) \u2014 the first person, [6,\u200911) \u2014 third person, [11,\u200916) \u2014 fifth person\n\nThe second window of the first type: [2,\u20097) \u2014 the second person, [7,\u200912) \u2014 the fourth person\n\nThe only second type window: [6,\u20097) \u2014 first, [7,\u20098) \u2014 second, [11,\u200912) \u2014 third, [12,\u200913) \u2014 fourth, [16,\u200917) \u2014 fifth\n\nThe only third type window: [7,\u20098) \u2014 first, [8,\u20099) \u2014 second, [12,\u200913) \u2014 third, [13,\u200914) \u2014 fourth, [17,\u200918) \u2014 fifth\n\nWe can see that it takes most time to serve the fifth person."}]}}

On one occasion, the corp cloned a boy Andryusha who was smarter than his comrades. Immediately Andryusha understood that something fishy was going on there. He rallied fellow clones to go on a feud against the evil corp, and they set out to find an exit from the lab. The corp had to reduce to destroy the lab complex.\n\nThe lab can be pictured as a connected graph with *n* vertices and *m* edges. *k* clones of Andryusha start looking for an exit in some of the vertices. Each clone can traverse any edge once per second. Any number of clones are allowed to be at any vertex simultaneously.

Vasya liked the idea of the method very much, and he decided to try it in practice.\n\nApplying the simplest variant of median smoothing to the sequence of numbers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* will result a new sequence *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**n* obtained by the following algorithm:\n -  *b*1<==<=*a*1, *b**n*<==<=*a**n*, that is, the first and the last number of the new sequence match the corresponding numbers of the original sequence. -  For *i*<==<=2,<=...,<=*n*<=-<=1 value *b**i* is equal to the median of three values *a**i*<=-<=1, *a**i* and *a**i*<=+<=1. \nThe median of a set of three numbers is the number that goes on the second place, when these three numbers are written in the non-decreasing order. For example, the median of the set 5, 1, 2 is number 2, and the median of set 1, 0, 1 is equal to 1.\n\nIn order to make the task easier, Vasya decided to apply the method to sequences consisting of zeros and ones only.\n\nHaving made the procedure once, Vasya looked at the resulting sequence and thought: what if I apply the algorithm to it once again, and then apply it to the next result, and so on? Vasya tried a couple of examples and found out that after some number of median smoothing algorithm applications the sequence can stop changing. We say that the sequence is stable, if it does not change when the median smoothing is applied to it.\n\nNow Vasya wonders, whether the sequence always eventually becomes stable. He asks you to write a program that, given a sequence of zeros and ones, will determine whether it ever becomes stable. Moreover, if it ever becomes stable, then you should determine what will it look like and how many times one needs to apply the median smoothing algorithm to initial sequence in order to obtain a stable one.\nInput specification: The first input line of the input contains a single integer *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=500<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the initial sequence.\n\nThe next line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (*a**i*<==<=0 or *a**i*<==<=1), giving the initial sequence itself.. Output specification: If the sequence will never become stable, print a single number <=-<=1.\n\nOtherwise, first print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of times one needs to apply the median smoothing algorithm to the initial sequence before it becomes is stable. In the second line print *n* numbers separated by a space \u00a0\u2014 the resulting sequence itself.\nDemo input: ['4\\n0 0 1 1\\n', '5\\n0 1 0 1 0\\n'], Demo output: ['0\\n0 0 1 1\\n', '2\\n0 0 0 0 0\\n']\nNote: In the second sample the stabilization occurs in two steps: <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/5a983e7baab048cbe43812cb997c15e9d7100231.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, and the sequence 00000 is obviously stable."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Let's consider a network printer that functions like that. It starts working at time 0. In each second it can print one page of a text. At some moments of time the printer receives printing tasks. We know that a printer received *n* tasks. Let's number the tasks by consecutive integers from 1 to *n*. Then the task number *i* is characterised by three integers: *t**i* is the time when the task came, *s**i* is the task's volume (in pages) and *p**i* is the task's priority. The priorities of all tasks are distinct.\n\nWhen the printer receives a task, the task goes to the queue and remains there until all pages from this task are printed. The printer chooses a page to print each time when it either stops printing some page or when it is free and receives a new task. Among all tasks that are in the queue at this moment, the printer chooses the task with the highest priority and next second prints an unprinted page from this task. You can assume that a task goes to the queue immediately, that's why if a task has just arrived by time *t*, the printer can already choose it for printing.\n\nYou are given full information about all tasks except for one: you don't know this task's priority. However, we know the time when the last page from this task was finished printing. Given this information, find the unknown priority value and determine the moments of time when the printer finished printing each task.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50000). Next *n* lines describe the tasks.

Exactly one task (let's assume that his number is *x*) has number -1 written instead of the priority. All priorities are different. The last line contains integer *T* \u2014 the time when the printer finished printing the last page of task *x* (1<=\u2264<=*T*<=\u2264<=1015). Numbers *t**i* are not necessarily distinct. The tasks in the input are written in the arbitrary order.. Output specification: In the first line print integer *p**x* \u2014 the priority of the task number *x* (1<=\u2264<=*p**x*<=\u2264<=109, remember that all priorities should be distinct). Then print *n* integers, the *i*-th of them represents the moment of time when the last page of the task number *i* finished printing. \n\nIt is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.

Let's assume that the unknown priority equals 4, then the printer's actions for each second are as follows:\n -  the beginning of the 1-st second (time 0). The queue has task 2. The printer prints the first page of this task; -  the beginning of the 2-nd second (time 1). The queue has tasks 2 and 3. The printer prints the first page of task 3; -  the beginning of the 3-rd second (time 2). The queue has tasks 2 and 3. The printer prints the second page of task 3; -  the beginning of the 4-th second (time 3). The queue has tasks 2 and 3. The printer prints the third (last) page of task 3. Thus, by the end of the 4-th second this task will have been printed; -  the beginning of the 5-th second (time 4). The queue has tasks 2 and 1. The printer prints the first page of task 1; -  the beginning of the 6-th second (time 5). The queue has tasks 2 and 1. The printer prints the second page of task 1; -  the beginning of the 7-th second (time 6). The queue has tasks 2 and 1. The printer prints the third (last) page of task 1. Thus, by the end of the 7-th second this task will have been printed; -  the beginning of the 8-th second (time 7). The queue has task 2. The printer prints the second (last) page of task 2. Thus, by the end of the 8-th second this task will have been printed. \nIn the end, task number 1 will have been printed by the end of the 7-th second, as was required.

Write a python script for the following problem: Little Petya is learning to play chess. He has already learned how to move a king, a rook and a bishop. Let us remind you the rules of moving chess pieces. A chessboard is 64 square fields organized into an 8<=\u00d7<=8 table. A field is represented by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*) \u2014 the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:\n -  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically. -  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally. -  A king moves one field in any direction \u2014 horizontally, vertically or diagonally. \nPetya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2)? At that, we assume that there are no more pieces besides this one on the board.

A pattern is usually defined as a string consisting of characters and metacharacters that sets the rules for your search. These patterns are most often used to check whether a particular string meets the certain rules.\n\nIn this task, a pattern will be a string consisting of small English letters and question marks ('?'). The question mark in the pattern is a metacharacter that denotes an arbitrary small letter of the English alphabet. We will assume that a string matches the pattern if we can transform the string into the pattern by replacing the question marks by the appropriate characters. For example, string aba matches patterns: ???, ??a, a?a, aba.\n\nProgrammers that work for the R1 company love puzzling each other (and themselves) with riddles. One of them is as follows: you are given *n* patterns of the same length, you need to find a pattern that contains as few question marks as possible, and intersects with each of the given patterns. Two patterns intersect if there is a string that matches both the first and the second pattern.

Next *n* lines contain the patterns.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the patterns can only consist of small English letters and symbols '?'. All patterns are non-empty and have the same length.

If integer *x*<=&gt;<=1 is not prime, it's called composite.\n\nYou can ask up to 20 queries about divisors of the hidden number. In each query you should print an integer from interval [2,<=100]. The system will answer \"yes\" if your integer is a divisor of the hidden number. Otherwise, the answer will be \"no\".\n\nFor example, if the hidden number is 14 then the system will answer \"yes\" only if you print 2, 7 or 14.\n\nWhen you are done asking queries, print \"prime\" or \"composite\" and terminate your program.\n\nYou will get the Wrong Answer verdict if you ask more than 20 queries, or if you print an integer not from the range [2,<=100].

The scheme is an undirected tree (connected acyclic graph) with a root in the vertex $1$, in which every leaf (excluding root) is an input, and all other vertices are logical elements, including the root, which is output.

Write a python script for the following problem: By 2312 there were *n* Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*)..

He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.

Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

He should find the number of different ordered pairs of indexes (*i*,<=*j*) such that *a**i*<=\u2264<=*a**j* and there are exactly *k* integers *y* such that *a**i*<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*a**j* and *y* is divisible by *x*.\n\nIn this problem it is meant that pair (*i*,<=*j*) is equal to (*j*,<=*i*) only if *i* is equal to *j*. For example pair (1,<=2) is not the same as (2,<=1).\nInput specification: The first line contains 3 integers *n*,<=*x*,<=*k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105,<=1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=109,<=0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=109), where *n* is the size of the array *a* and *x* and *k* are numbers from the statement.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 the elements of the array *a*..

Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy.

The second line contains one integer *n*, the number of queries (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=104).

Each pair in the communicated sets comprises two different numbers.\n\nDetermine if you can with certainty deduce the common number, or if you can determine with certainty that both participants know the number but you do not.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 12$) \u2014 the number of pairs the first participant communicated to the second and vice versa.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ pairs of integers, each between $1$ and $9$, \u2014 pairs of numbers communicated from first participant to the second.\n\nThe third line contains $m$ pairs of integers, each between $1$ and $9$, \u2014 pairs of numbers communicated from the second participant to the first.\n\nAll pairs within each set are distinct (in particular, if there is a pair $(1,2)$, there will be no pair $(2,1)$ within the same set), and no pair contains the same number twice.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the two sets do not contradict the statements, in other words, there is pair from the first set and a pair from the second set that share exactly one number..

Since we know that the actual pairs they received share exactly one number, it can't be that they both have $(3,4)$. Thus, the first participant has $(1,2)$ and the second has $(1,5)$, and at this point you already know the shared number is $1$.\n\nIn the second example either the first participant has $(1,2)$ and the second has $(1,5)$, or the first has $(3,4)$ and the second has $(6,4)$. In the first case both of them know the shared number is $1$, in the second case both of them know the shared number is $4$. You don't have enough information to tell $1$ and $4$ apart.\n\nIn the third case if the first participant was given $(1,2)$, they don't know what the shared number is, since from their perspective the second participant might have been given either $(1,3)$, in which case the shared number is $1$, or $(2,3)$, in which case the shared number is $2$. While the second participant does know the number with certainty, neither you nor the first participant do, so the output is $-1$."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Natasha is going to fly on a rocket to Mars and return to Earth. Also, on the way to Mars, she will land on $n - 2$ intermediate planets. Formally: we number all the planets from $1$ to $n$. $1$ is Earth, $n$ is Mars. Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt.

Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons.-  During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining.-  While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. There will be $14$ tons of rocket with fuel after that.-  During landing on Earth, one ton of fuel can land $7$ tons of cargo, so for landing $14$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel.

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes.

Then follow *k* lines, each of them contains two integers *dx**i* and *dy**i* (|*dx**i*|,<=|*dy**i*|<=\u2264<=109,<=|*dx*|<=+<=|*dy*|<=\u2265<=1)..

He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

In a few moments they were ready, and the dirigible of the rescue chipmunks hit the road.\n\nWe assume that the action takes place on a Cartesian plane. The headquarters of the rescuers is located at point (*x*1,<=*y*1), and the distress signal came from the point (*x*2,<=*y*2).\n\nDue to Gadget's engineering talent, the rescuers' dirigible can instantly change its current velocity and direction of movement at any moment and as many times as needed. The only limitation is: the speed of the aircraft relative to the air can not exceed  meters per second.\n\nOf course, Gadget is a true rescuer and wants to reach the destination as soon as possible. The matter is complicated by the fact that the wind is blowing in the air and it affects the movement of the dirigible. According to the weather forecast, the wind will be defined by the vector (*v**x*,<=*v**y*) for the nearest *t* seconds, and then will change to (*w**x*,<=*w**y*). These vectors give both the direction and velocity of the wind. Formally, if a dirigible is located at the point (*x*,<=*y*), while its own velocity relative to the air is equal to zero and the wind (*u**x*,<=*u**y*) is blowing, then after  seconds the new position of the dirigible will be .\n\nGadget is busy piloting the aircraft, so she asked Chip to calculate how long will it take them to reach the destination if they fly optimally. He coped with the task easily, but Dale is convinced that Chip has given the random value, aiming only not to lose the face in front of Gadget.

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.

Write a python script for the following problem: Uncle Fyodor, Matroskin the Cat and Sharic the Dog live their simple but happy lives in Prostokvashino. Sometimes they receive parcels from Uncle Fyodor\u2019s parents and sometimes from anonymous benefactors, in which case it is hard to determine to which one of them the package has been sent. A photographic rifle is obviously for Sharic who loves hunting and fish is for Matroskin, but for whom was a new video game console meant? Every one of the three friends claimed that the present is for him and nearly quarreled. Uncle Fyodor had an idea how to solve the problem justly: they should suppose that the console was sent to all three of them and play it in turns. Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up \u2014 who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that\u2019s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player wins. Otherwise, another game round is required. Write a program that will determine the winner by the gestures they have shown.\nInput specification: The first input line contains the name of the gesture that Uncle Fyodor showed, the second line shows which gesture Matroskin showed and the third line shows Sharic\u2019s gesture..

Write a python script for the following problem: Ahmed and Mostafa used to compete together in many programming contests for several years. Their coach Fegla asked them to solve one challenging problem, of course Ahmed was able to solve it but Mostafa couldn't.\n\nThis problem is similar to a standard problem but it has a different format and constraints.\n\nIn the standard problem you are given an array of integers, and you have to find one or more consecutive elements in this array where their sum is the maximum possible sum.\n\nBut in this problem you are given *n* small arrays, and you will create one big array from the concatenation of one or more instances of the small arrays (each small array could occur more than once). The big array will be given as an array of indexes (1-based) of the small arrays, and the concatenation should be done in the same order as in this array. Then you should apply the standard problem mentioned above on the resulting big array.\n\nFor example let's suppose that the small arrays are {1, 6, -2}, {3, 3} and {-5, 1}. And the indexes in the big array are {2, 3, 1, 3}. So the actual values in the big array after formatting it as concatenation of the small arrays will be {3, 3, -5, 1, 1, 6, -2, -5, 1}. In this example the maximum sum is 9.\n\nCan you help Mostafa solve this problem?\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m*, *n* is the number of the small arrays (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50), and *m* is the number of indexes in the big array (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=250000). Then follow *n* lines, the *i*-th line starts with one integer *l* which is the size of the *i*-th array (1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=5000), followed by *l* integers each one will be greater than or equal -1000 and less than or equal 1000. The last line contains *m* integers which are the indexes in the big array, and you should concatenate the small arrays in the same order, and each index will be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to *n*.\n\nThe small arrays are numbered from 1 to *n* in the same order as given in the input. Some of the given small arrays may not be used in big array.\n\nNote, that the array is very big. So if you try to build it straightforwardly, you will probably get time or/and memory limit exceeded.. Output specification: Print one line containing the maximum sum in the big array after formatting it as described above. You must choose at least one element for the sum, i. e. it cannot be empty.\n\nPlease, do not use %lld specificator to write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use cout (also you may use %I64d).\nDemo input: ['3 4\\n3 1 6 -2\\n2 3 3\\n2 -5 1\\n2 3 1 3\\n', '6 1\\n4 0 8 -3 -10\\n8 3 -2 -5 10 8 -9 -5 -4\\n1 0\\n1 -3\\n3 -8 5 6\\n2 9 6\\n1\\n'], Demo output: ['9\\n', '8\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

There will be *n* players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.\n\nOrganizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.\n\nTournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\nInput specification: The only line of the input contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1018)\u00a0\u2014 the number of players to participate in the tournament..

Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1,\u20092) and (3,\u20094) and then clash the winners."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the elements of array. \n\nThe third line contains integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs.

A field is represented by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*) \u2014 the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters).

That's why he decided to obfuscate (intentionally make less readable) his code before upcoming contest.\n\nTo obfuscate the code, Kostya first looks at the first variable name used in his program and replaces all its occurrences with a single symbol *a*, then he looks at the second variable name that has not been replaced yet, and replaces all its occurrences with *b*, and so on. Kostya is well-mannered, so he doesn't use any one-letter names before obfuscation. Moreover, there are at most 26 unique identifiers in his programs.\n\nYou are given a list of identifiers of some program with removed spaces and line breaks. Check if this program can be a result of Kostya's obfuscation.\nInput specification: In the only line of input there is a string *S* of lowercase English letters (1<=\u2264<=|*S*|<=\u2264<=500)\u00a0\u2014 the identifiers of a program with removed whitespace characters..

Here how Kostya would obfuscate the program:\n-  replace all occurences of number with a, the result would be \"a string a character a string a\",-  replace all occurences of string with b, the result would be \"a b a character a b a\",-  replace all occurences of character with c, the result would be \"a b a c a b a\",-  all identifiers have been replaced, thus the obfuscation is finished."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$..

Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$."}]}}

Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell.

Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy.

It means that exactly one vertex is a root, and each vertex is either a leaf (and doesn't have children) or an inner node (and has exactly two children). All leaves of a complete binary tree have the same depth (distance from the root). So *n* is a number such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nIn the picture you can see a complete binary tree with *n*<==<=15.\n\nVertices are numbered from 1 to *n* in a special recursive way: we recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the left subtree (if current vertex is not a leaf), then assign a number to the current vertex, and then recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the right subtree (if it exists). In the picture vertices are numbered exactly using this algorithm. It is clear that for each size of a complete binary tree exists exactly one way to give numbers to all vertices. This way of numbering is called symmetric.\n\nYou have to write a program that for given *n* answers *q* queries to the tree.\n\nEach query consists of an integer number *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) and a string *s**i*, where *u**i* is the number of vertex, and *s**i* represents the path starting from this vertex. String *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U', which mean traverse to the left child, to the right child and to the parent, respectively. Characters from *s**i* have to be processed from left to right, considering that *u**i* is the vertex where the path starts. If it's impossible to process a character (for example, to go to the left child of a leaf), then you have to skip it.

But Jack knows on what planet will Apophis land. In order to save his friends, Jack must repeatedly go through stargates to get to this planet.\n\nOverall the galaxy has *n* planets, indexed with numbers from 1 to *n*. Jack is on the planet with index 1, and Apophis will land on the planet with index *n*. Jack can move between some pairs of planets through stargates (he can move in both directions); the transfer takes a positive, and, perhaps, for different pairs of planets unequal number of seconds. Jack begins his journey at time 0.\n\nIt can be that other travellers are arriving to the planet where Jack is currently located. In this case, Jack has to wait for exactly 1 second before he can use the stargate. That is, if at time *t* another traveller arrives to the planet, Jack can only pass through the stargate at time *t*<=+<=1, unless there are more travellers arriving at time *t*<=+<=1 to the same planet.\n\nKnowing the information about travel times between the planets, and the times when Jack would not be able to use the stargate on particular planets, determine the minimum time in which he can get to the planet with index *n*.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers: *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105), the number of planets in the galaxy, and *m* (0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of pairs of planets between which Jack can travel using stargates.

Next *n* lines contain the descriptions of these segments. The *i*-th line contains three space-separated integers *r**i*,<=*a**i*,<=*b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*r**i*,<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=109,<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*b**i*), denoting that cells in columns from number *a**i* to number *b**i* inclusive in the *r**i*-th row are allowed. Note that the segments of the allowed cells can intersect and embed arbitrarily.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the king's initial and final position are allowed cells. It is guaranteed that the king's initial and the final positions do not coincide. It is guaranteed that the total length of all given segments doesn't exceed 105.. Output specification: If there is no path between the initial and final position along allowed cells, print -1.\n\nOtherwise print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of moves the king needs to get from the initial position to the final one.\nDemo input: ['5 7 6 11\\n3\\n5 3 8\\n6 7 11\\n5 2 5\\n', '3 4 3 10\\n3\\n3 1 4\\n4 5 9\\n3 10 10\\n', '1 1 2 10\\n2\\n1 1 3\\n2 6 10\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n', '6\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: You are given *n* strings *s*1,<=*s*2,<=...,<=*s**n* consisting of characters 0 and 1. *m* operations are performed, on each of them you concatenate two existing strings into a new one. On the *i*-th operation the concatenation *s**a**i**s**b**i* is saved into a new string *s**n*<=+<=*i* (the operations are numbered starting from 1). After each operation you need to find the maximum positive integer *k* such that all possible strings consisting of 0 and 1 of length *k* (there are 2*k* such strings) are substrings of the new string. If there is no such *k*, print 0.\nInput specification: The first line contains single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of strings. The next *n* lines contain strings *s*1,<=*s*2,<=...,<=*s**n* (1<=\u2264<=|*s**i*|<=\u2264<=100), one per line. The total length of strings is not greater than 100.\n\nThe next line contains single integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of operations. *m* lines follow, each of them contains two integers *a**i* abd *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=+<=*i*<=-<=1)\u00a0\u2014 the number of strings that are concatenated to form *s**n*<=+<=*i*.. Output specification: Print *m* lines, each should contain one integer\u00a0\u2014 the answer to the question after the corresponding operation.\nDemo input: ['5\\n01\\n10\\n101\\n11111\\n0\\n3\\n1 2\\n6 5\\n4 4\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n2\\n0\\n']\nNote: On the first operation, a new string \"0110\" is created. For *k*\u2009=\u20091 the two possible binary strings of length *k* are \"0\" and \"1\", they are substrings of the new string. For *k*\u2009=\u20092 and greater there exist strings of length *k* that do not appear in this string (for *k*\u2009=\u20092 such string is \"00\"). So the answer is 1.\n\nOn the second operation the string \"01100\" is created. Now all strings of length *k*\u2009=\u20092 are present.\n\nOn the third operation the string \"1111111111\" is created. There is no zero, so the answer is 0."}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: A guy named Vasya attends the final grade of a high school. One day Vasya decided to watch a match of his favorite hockey team. And, as the boy loves hockey very much, even more than physics, he forgot to do the homework. Specifically, he forgot to complete his physics tasks. Next day the teacher got very angry at Vasya and decided to teach him a lesson. He gave the lazy student a seemingly easy task: You are given an idle body in space and the forces that affect it. The body can be considered as a material point with coordinates (0; 0; 0). Vasya had only to answer whether it is in equilibrium. \"Piece of cake\" \u2014 thought Vasya, we need only to check if the sum of all vectors is equal to 0. So, Vasya began to solve the problem. But later it turned out that there can be lots and lots of these forces, and Vasya can not cope without your help. Help him. Write a program that determines whether a body is idle or is moving by the given vectors of forces.\nInput specification: The first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), then follow *n* lines containing three integers each: the *x**i* coordinate, the *y**i* coordinate and the *z**i* coordinate of the force vector, applied to the body (<=-<=100<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*,<=*z**i*<=\u2264<=100).. Output specification: Print the word \"YES\" if the body is in equilibrium, or the word \"NO\" if it is not.\nDemo input: ['3\\n4 1 7\\n-2 4 -1\\n1 -5 -3\\n', '3\\n3 -1 7\\n-5 2 -4\\n2 -1 -3\\n'], Demo output: ['NO', 'YES']\nNote: none"}]}}
