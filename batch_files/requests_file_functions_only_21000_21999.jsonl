Write a python script for the following problem: Doubly linked list is one of the fundamental data structures. A doubly linked list is a sequence of elements, each containing information about the previous and the next elements of the list. In this problem all lists have linear structure. I.e. each element except the first has exactly one previous element, each element except the last has exactly one next element. The list is not closed in a cycle.\n\nIn this problem you are given *n* memory cells forming one or more doubly linked lists. Each cell contains information about element from some list. Memory cells are numbered from 1 to *n*.\n\nFor each cell *i* you are given two values: \n -  *l**i* \u2014 cell containing previous element for the element in the cell *i*; -  *r**i* \u2014 cell containing next element for the element in the cell *i*. \nIf cell *i* contains information about the element which has no previous element then *l**i*<==<=0. Similarly, if cell *i* contains information about the element which has no next element then *r**i*<==<=0.\n\nFor example, for the picture above the values of *l* and *r* are the following: *l*1<==<=4, *r*1<==<=7; *l*2<==<=5, *r*2<==<=0; *l*3<==<=0, *r*3<==<=0; *l*4<==<=6, *r*4<==<=1; *l*5<==<=0, *r*5<==<=2; *l*6<==<=0, *r*6<==<=4; *l*7<==<=1, *r*7<==<=0.\n\nYour task is to unite all given lists in a single list, joining them to each other in any order. In particular, if the input data already contains a single list, then there is no need to perform any actions. Print the resulting list in the form of values *l**i*, *r**i*.\n\nAny other action, other than joining the beginning of one list to the end of another, can not be performed.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of memory cells where the doubly linked lists are located.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains two integers *l**i*, *r**i* (0<=\u2264<=*l**i*,<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the cells of the previous and the next element of list for cell *i*. Value *l**i*<==<=0 if element in cell *i* has no previous element in its list. Value *r**i*<==<=0 if element in cell *i* has no next element in its list.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the input contains the correct description of a single or more doubly linked lists. All lists have linear structure: each element of list except the first has exactly one previous element; each element of list except the last has exactly one next element. Each memory cell contains information about one element from some list, each element of each list written in one of *n* given cells..

The good thing is that chef Gerasim always pour the same number of milliliters of juice to all cups in the royal kitchen.

The time to enjoy those around them is so little that some even stand in queues to several rooms at the same time in the clinic, running from one queue to another.\n\n(Cultural note: standing in huge and disorganized queues for hours is a native tradition in Russia, dating back to the Soviet period. Queues can resemble crowds rather than lines. Not to get lost in such a queue, a person should follow a strict survival technique: you approach the queue and ask who the last person is, somebody answers and you join the crowd. Now you're the last person in the queue till somebody else shows up. You keep an eye on the one who was last before you as he is your only chance to get to your destination) I'm sure many people have had the problem when a stranger asks who the last person in the queue is and even dares to hint that he will be the last in the queue and then bolts away to some unknown destination. These are the representatives of the modern world, in which the ratio of lack of time is so great that they do not even watch foreign top-rated TV series. Such people often create problems in queues, because the newcomer does not see the last person in the queue and takes a place after the \"virtual\" link in this chain, wondering where this legendary figure has left.\n\nThe Smart Beaver has been ill and he's made an appointment with a therapist. The doctor told the Beaver the sad news in a nutshell: it is necessary to do an electrocardiogram.

If the beaver did not know his correct position in the queue, then it might be his turn to go get an ECG, or maybe he should wait for a long, long time...\n\nAs you've guessed, the Smart Beaver was in a hurry home, so he gave you all the necessary information for you to help him to determine what his number in the queue can be.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=103) and *x* (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of beavers that stand in the queue and the Smart Beaver's number, correspondingly.

Write a python script for the following problem: By 2312 there were *n* Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*).. Output specification: Print *m* lines \u2014 the results of executing requests in the above given format. The requests should be processed in the order, in which they are given in the input.

Of all the possible values that meet these conditions, the exchange rate for tomorrow will be the maximum possible. It is guaranteed that today the exchange rate is an odd positive integer *n*. Help Anton to determine the exchange rate of currency you all know for tomorrow!\nInput specification: The first line contains an odd positive integer *n*\u00a0\u2014 the exchange rate of currency you all know for today. The length of number *n*'s representation is within range from 2 to 105, inclusive. The representation of *n* doesn't contain any leading zeroes.. Output specification: If the information about tomorrow's exchange rate is inconsistent, that is, there is no integer that meets the condition, print <=-<=1.\n\nOtherwise, print the exchange rate of currency you all know against the burle for tomorrow. This should be the maximum possible number of those that are even and that are obtained from today's exchange rate by swapping exactly two digits. Exchange rate representation should not contain leading zeroes.\nDemo input: ['527\\n', '4573\\n', '1357997531\\n'], Demo output: ['572\\n', '3574\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Formally: we number all the planets from $1$ to $n$. $1$ is Earth, $n$ is Mars. Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket.

Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons.-  During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining.-  While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. There will be $14$ tons of rocket with fuel after that.-  During landing on Earth, one ton of fuel can land $7$ tons of cargo, so for landing $14$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel.

This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper.

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes.

So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091). He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

The public key is a long integer which may consist of even a million digits!\n\nPolycarpus needs to find such a way to cut the public key into two nonempty parts, that the first (left) part is divisible by *a* as a separate number, and the second (right) part is divisible by *b* as a separate number.

Write a python script for the following problem: Vasya used to be an accountant before the war began and he is one of the few who knows how to operate a computer, so he was assigned as the programmer.\n\nWe all know that programs often store sets of integers. For example, if we have a problem about a weighted directed graph, its edge can be represented by three integers: the number of the starting vertex, the number of the final vertex and the edge's weight. So, as Vasya was trying to represent characteristics of a recently invented robot in his program, he faced the following problem.\n\nVasya is not a programmer, so he asked his friend Gena, what the convenient way to store *n* integers is. Gena used to code in language X-- and so he can use only the types that occur in this language. Let's define, what a \"type\" is in language X--:\n -  First, a type is a string \"int\". -  Second, a type is a string that starts with \"pair\", then followed by angle brackets listing exactly two comma-separated other types of language X--. This record contains no spaces. -  No other strings can be regarded as types. \nMore formally: type := int | pair&lt;type,type&gt;. For example, Gena uses the following type for graph edges: pair&lt;int,pair&lt;int,int&gt;&gt;.\n\nGena was pleased to help Vasya, he dictated to Vasya a type of language X--, that stores *n* integers. Unfortunately, Gena was in a hurry, so he omitted the punctuation. Now Gena has already left and Vasya can't find the correct punctuation, resulting in a type of language X--, however hard he tries.\n\nHelp Vasya and add the punctuation marks so as to receive the valid type of language X--. Otherwise say that the task is impossible to perform.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105), showing how many numbers the type dictated by Gena contains.\n\nThe second line contains space-separated words, said by Gena. Each of them is either \"pair\" or \"int\" (without the quotes).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total number of words does not exceed 105 and that among all the words that Gena said, there are exactly *n* words \"int\".. Output specification: If it is possible to add the punctuation marks so as to get a correct type of language X-- as a result, print a single line that represents the resulting type. Otherwise, print \"Error occurred\" (without the quotes). Inside the record of a type should not be any extra spaces and other characters. \n\nIt is guaranteed that if such type exists, then it is unique.\n\nNote that you should print the type dictated by Gena (if such type exists) and not any type that can contain *n* values.\nDemo input: ['3\\npair pair int int int\\n', '1\\npair int\\n'], Demo output: ['pair&lt;pair&lt;int,int&gt;,int&gt;', 'Error occurred']\nNote: none"}]}}

If so, you should find out any such order.\n\nLexicographical order is defined in following way. When we compare *s* and *t*, first we find the leftmost position with differing characters: *s**i*<=\u2260<=*t**i*.

Besides, after adding these edges the graph should be simple (doesn't contain loops or multiple edges). What is the maximum number of edges they can add?\n\nA loop is an edge, which connects a node with itself.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Programmer Vasya is studying a new programming language &amp;K*. The &amp;K* language resembles the languages of the C family in its syntax. However, it is more powerful, which is why the rules of the actual C-like languages are unapplicable to it. To fully understand the statement, please read the language's description below carefully and follow it and not the similar rules in real programming languages.\n\nThere is a very powerful system of pointers on &amp;K* \u2014 you can add an asterisk to the right of the existing type *X* \u2014 that will result in new type *X*<=*<=. That is called pointer-definition operation. Also, there is the operation that does the opposite \u2014 to any type of *X*, which is a pointer, you can add an ampersand \u2014 that will result in a type &amp;*X*, to which refers *X*. That is called a dereference operation.\n\nThe &amp;K* language has only two basic data types \u2014 void and errtype. Also, the language has operators typedef and typeof.\n-  The operator \"typedef *A* *B*\" defines a new data type *B*, which is equivalent to *A*. *A* can have asterisks and ampersands, and *B* cannot have them. For example, the operator typedef void** ptptvoid will create a new type ptptvoid, that can be used as void**.-  The operator \"typeof *A*\" returns type of *A*, brought to void, that is, returns the type void**...*, equivalent to it with the necessary number of asterisks (the number can possibly be zero). That is, having defined the ptptvoid type, as shown above, the typeof ptptvoid operator will return void**.\nAn attempt of dereferencing of the void type will lead to an error: to a special data type errtype. For errtype the following equation holds true: errtype*<==<=&amp;errtype<==<=errtype. An attempt to use the data type that hasn't been defined before that will also lead to the errtype.\n\nUsing typedef, we can define one type several times. Of all the definitions only the last one is valid. However, all the types that have been defined earlier using this type do not change.\n\nLet us also note that the dereference operation has the lower priority that the pointer operation, in other words &amp;*T*<=*<= is always equal to *T*.\n\nNote, that the operators are executed consecutively one by one. If we have two operators \"typedef &amp;void a\" and \"typedef a* b\", then at first a becomes errtype, and after that b becomes errtype* = errtype, but not &amp;void* = void (see sample 2).\n\nVasya does not yet fully understand this powerful technology, that's why he asked you to help him. Write a program that analyzes these operators.\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of operators. Then follow *n* lines with operators. Each operator is of one of two types: either \"typedef *A* *B*\", or \"typeof *A*\". In the first case the *B* type differs from void and errtype types, and besides, doesn't have any asterisks and ampersands.\n\nAll the data type names are non-empty lines of no more than 20 lowercase Latin letters. The number of asterisks and ampersands separately in one type in any operator does not exceed 10, however if we bring some types to void with several asterisks, their number may exceed 10.. Output specification: For every typeof operator print on the single line the answer to that operator \u2014 the type that the given operator returned.\nDemo input: ['5\\ntypedef void* ptv\\ntypeof ptv\\ntypedef &amp;&amp;ptv node\\ntypeof node\\ntypeof &amp;ptv\\n', '17\\ntypedef void* b\\ntypedef b* c\\ntypeof b\\ntypeof c\\ntypedef &amp;b b\\ntypeof b\\ntypeof c\\ntypedef &amp;&amp;b* c\\ntypeof c\\ntypedef &amp;b* c\\ntypeof c\\ntypedef &amp;void b\\ntypeof b\\ntypedef b******* c\\ntypeof c\\ntypedef &amp;&amp;b* c\\ntypeof c\\n'], Demo output: ['void*\\nerrtype\\nvoid\\n', 'void*\\nvoid**\\nvoid\\nvoid**\\nerrtype\\nvoid\\nerrtype\\nerrtype\\nerrtype\\n']\nNote: Let's look at the second sample.\n\nAfter the first two queries typedef the b type is equivalent to void*, and \u0441 \u2014 to void**.\n\nThe next query typedef redefines b \u2014 it is now equal to &amp;b = &amp;void* = void. At that, the \u0441 type doesn't change.\n\nAfter that the \u0441 type is defined as &amp;&amp;b* = &amp;&amp;void* = &amp;void = errtype. It doesn't influence the b type, that's why the next typedef defines c as &amp;void* = void.\n\nThen the b type is again redefined as &amp;void = errtype. \n\nPlease note that the c type in the next query is defined exactly as errtype******* = errtype, and not &amp;void******* = void******. The same happens in the last typedef."}]}}

By the results of these training sessions teams are composed for the oncoming team contest season. Each team consists of three people. All the students of the Centre possess numbers from 1 to 3*n*, and all the teams possess numbers from 1 to *n*. The splitting of students into teams is performed in the following manner: while there are people who are not part of a team, a person with the best total score is chosen among them (the captain of a new team), this person chooses for himself two teammates from those who is left according to his list of priorities. The list of every person's priorities is represented as a permutation from the rest of 3*n*<=-<=1 students who attend the centre, besides himself.\n\nYou are given the results of personal training sessions which are a permutation of numbers from 1 to 3*n*, where the *i*-th number is the number of student who has won the *i*-th place. No two students share a place. You are also given the arrangement of the already formed teams in the order in which they has been created.

Write a python script for the following problem: One tradition of ACM-ICPC contests is that a team gets a balloon for every solved problem. We assume that the submission time doesn't matter and teams are sorted only by the number of balloons they have. It means that one's place is equal to the number of teams with more balloons, increased by 1. For example, if there are seven teams with more balloons, you get the eight place. Ties are allowed.\n\nYou should know that it's important to eat before a contest. If the number of balloons of a team is greater than the weight of this team, the team starts to float in the air together with their workstation. They eventually touch the ceiling, what is strictly forbidden by the rules. The team is then disqualified and isn't considered in the standings.\n\nA contest has just finished. There are *n* teams, numbered 1 through *n*. The *i*-th team has *t**i* balloons and weight *w**i*. It's guaranteed that *t**i* doesn't exceed *w**i* so nobody floats initially.\n\nLimak is a member of the first team. He doesn't like cheating and he would never steal balloons from other teams.

There are three teams with more balloons (32, 40 and 45 balloons), so Limak has the fourth place initially. One optimal strategy is:\n1.  Limak gives 6 balloons away to a team with 32 balloons and weight 37, which is just enough to make them fly. Unfortunately, Limak has only 14 balloons now and he would get the fifth place.1.  Limak gives 6 balloons away to a team with 45 balloons. Now they have 51 balloons and weight 50 so they fly and get disqualified.1.  Limak gives 1 balloon to each of two teams with 16 balloons initially.1.  Limak has 20\u2009-\u20096\u2009-\u20096\u2009-\u20091\u2009-\u20091\u2009=\u20096 balloons.1.  There are three other teams left and their numbers of balloons are 40, 14 and 2.1.  Limak gets the third place because there are two teams with more balloons. \nIn the second sample, Limak has the second place and he can't improve it.\n\nIn the third sample, Limak has just enough balloons to get rid of teams 2, 3 and 5 (the teams with 81\u2009000\u2009000\u2009000, 5\u2009000\u2009000\u2009000 and 46\u2009000\u2009000\u2009000 balloons respectively).

Write a python script for the following problem: To confuse the opponents, the Galactic Empire represents fractions in an unusual format. The fractions are represented as two sets of integers. The product of numbers from the first set gives the fraction numerator, the product of numbers from the second set gives the fraction denominator.

As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too.

Write a python script for the following problem: A long time ago (probably even in the first book), Nicholas Flamel, a great alchemist and the creator of the Philosopher's Stone, taught Harry Potter three useful spells. The first one allows you to convert *a* grams of sand into *b* grams of lead, the second one allows you to convert *c* grams of lead into *d* grams of gold and third one allows you to convert *e* grams of gold into *f* grams of sand. When Harry told his friends about these spells, Ron Weasley was amazed. After all, if they succeed in turning sand into lead, lead into gold, and then turning part of the gold into sand again and so on, then it will be possible to start with a small amount of sand and get huge amounts of gold! Even an infinite amount of gold! Hermione Granger, by contrast, was skeptical about that idea. She argues that according to the law of conservation of matter getting an infinite amount of matter, even using magic, is impossible. On the contrary, the amount of matter may even decrease during transformation, being converted to magical energy. Though Hermione's theory seems convincing, Ron won't believe her. As far as Ron is concerned, Hermione made up her law of conservation of matter to stop Harry and Ron wasting their time with this nonsense, and to make them go and do homework instead. That's why Ron has already collected a certain amount of sand for the experiments. A quarrel between the friends seems unavoidable...\n\nHelp Harry to determine which one of his friends is right, and avoid the quarrel after all. To do this you have to figure out whether it is possible to get the amount of gold greater than any preassigned number from some finite amount of sand.\nInput specification: The first line contains 6 integers *a*, *b*, *c*, *d*, *e*, *f* (0<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*,<=*c*,<=*d*,<=*e*,<=*f*<=\u2264<=1000).. Output specification: Print \"Ron\", if it is possible to get an infinitely large amount of gold having a certain finite amount of sand (and not having any gold and lead at all), i.e., Ron is right. Otherwise, print \"Hermione\".\nDemo input: ['100 200 250 150 200 250\\n', '100 50 50 200 200 100\\n', '100 10 200 20 300 30\\n', '0 0 0 0 0 0\\n', '1 1 0 1 1 1\\n', '1 0 1 2 1 2\\n', '100 1 100 1 0 1\\n'], Demo output: ['Ron\\n', 'Hermione\\n', 'Hermione\\n', 'Hermione\\n', 'Ron\\n', 'Hermione\\n', 'Ron\\n']\nNote: Consider the first sample. Let's start with the 500 grams of sand. Apply the first spell 5 times and turn the sand into 1000 grams of lead. Then apply the second spell 4 times to get 600 grams of gold. Let\u2019s take 400 grams from the resulting amount of gold turn them back into sand. We get 500 grams of sand and 200 grams of gold. If we apply the same operations to 500 grams of sand again, we can get extra 200 grams of gold every time. Thus, you can get 200, 400, 600 etc. grams of gold, i.e., starting with a finite amount of sand (500 grams), you can get the amount of gold which is greater than any preassigned number.\n\nIn the forth sample it is impossible to get sand, or lead, or gold, applying the spells.\n\nIn the fifth sample an infinitely large amount of gold can be obtained by using only the second spell, which allows you to receive 1 gram of gold out of nothing. Note that if such a second spell is available, then the first and the third one do not affect the answer at all.\n\nThe seventh sample is more interesting. We can also start with a zero amount of sand there. With the aid of the third spell you can get sand out of nothing. We get 10000 grams of sand in this manner. Let's get 100 grams of lead using the first spell 100 times. Then make 1 gram of gold from them. We managed to receive 1 gram of gold, starting with a zero amount of sand! Clearly, in this manner you can get an infinitely large amount of gold."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Polycarp lives on a coordinate line at the point $x = 0$. He goes to his friend that lives at the point $x = a$. Polycarp can move only from left to right, he can pass one unit of length each second.\n\nNow it's raining, so some segments of his way are in the rain. Formally, it's raining on $n$ non-intersecting segments, the $i$-th segment which is in the rain is represented as $[l_i, r_i]$ ($0 \\le l_i &lt; r_i \\le a$).\n\nThere are $m$ umbrellas lying on the line, the $i$-th umbrella is located at point $x_i$ ($0 \\le x_i \\le a$) and has weight $p_i$. When Polycarp begins his journey, he doesn't have any umbrellas.\n\nDuring his journey from $x = 0$ to $x = a$ Polycarp can pick up and throw away umbrellas. Polycarp picks up and throws down any umbrella instantly. He can carry any number of umbrellas at any moment of time. Because Polycarp doesn't want to get wet, he must carry at least one umbrella while he moves from $x$ to $x + 1$ if a segment $[x, x + 1]$ is in the rain (i.e. if there exists some $i$ such that $l_i \\le x$ and $x + 1 \\le r_i$).\n\nThe condition above is the only requirement. For example, it is possible to go without any umbrellas to a point where some rain segment starts, pick up an umbrella at this point and move along with an umbrella. Polycarp can swap umbrellas while he is in the rain.\n\nEach unit of length passed increases Polycarp's fatigue by the sum of the weights of umbrellas he carries while moving.\n\nCan Polycarp make his way from point $x = 0$ to point $x = a$? If yes, find the minimum total fatigue after reaching $x = a$, if Polycarp picks up and throws away umbrellas optimally.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers $a$, $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le a, m \\le 2000, 1 \\le n \\le \\lceil\\frac{a}{2}\\rceil$) \u2014 the point at which Polycarp's friend lives, the number of the segments in the rain and the number of umbrellas.\n\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($0 \\le l_i &lt; r_i \\le a$) \u2014 the borders of the $i$-th segment under rain. It is guaranteed that there is no pair of intersecting segments. In other words, for each pair of segments $i$ and $j$ either $r_i &lt; l_j$ or $r_j &lt; l_i$.\n\nEach of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $p_i$ ($0 \\le x_i \\le a$, $1 \\le p_i \\le 10^5$) \u2014 the location and the weight of the $i$-th umbrella.. Output specification: Print \"-1\" (without quotes) if Polycarp can't make his way from point $x = 0$ to point $x = a$.

Fortunately for Karlsson, there wasn't anybody in his friend's house. Karlsson was not going to be hungry any longer, so he decided to get some food in the house.\n\nKarlsson's gaze immediately fell on *n* wooden cupboards, standing in the kitchen. He immediately realized that these cupboards have hidden jam stocks. Karlsson began to fly greedily around the kitchen, opening and closing the cupboards' doors, grab and empty all the jars of jam that he could find.\n\nAnd now all jars of jam are empty, Karlsson has had enough and does not want to leave traces of his stay, so as not to let down his friend. Each of the cupboards has two doors: the left one and the right one. Karlsson remembers that when he rushed to the kitchen, all the cupboards' left doors were in the same position (open or closed), similarly, all the cupboards' right doors were in the same position (open or closed). Karlsson wants the doors to meet this condition as well by the time the family returns. Karlsson does not remember the position of all the left doors, also, he cannot remember the position of all the right doors. Therefore, it does not matter to him in what position will be all left or right doors. It is important to leave all the left doors in the same position, and all the right doors in the same position. For example, all the left doors may be closed, and all the right ones may be open.\n\nKarlsson needs one second to open or close a door of a cupboard.

Write a python script for the following problem: In one little known, but very beautiful country called Waterland, lives a lovely shark Valerie. Like all the sharks, she has several rows of teeth, and feeds on crucians. One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are \"relaxing\".\n\nFor a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap).\n\nIt turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again. \n\nUnhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her. For sure, the shark couldn't say no to her favourite meal, but she had no desire to go back to the dentist. That's why she decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that the viability of no tooth becomes negative. \n\nAs Valerie is not good at mathematics, she asked you to help her to find out the total amount of crucians that she can consume for dinner.\n\nWe should remind you that while eating one crucian Valerie uses exactly one row of teeth and the viability of each tooth from this row decreases by one.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000,<=0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 total amount of Valerie's teeth, amount of tooth rows and amount of crucians in Valerie's portion for dinner.

Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket.

Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons.-  During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining.-  While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel.

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$..

Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$."}]}}

Wilbur had all four vertices of the planned pool written on a paper, until his friend came along and erased some of the vertices.\n\nNow Wilbur is wondering, if the remaining *n* vertices of the initial rectangle give enough information to restore the area of the planned swimming pool.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=4)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices that were not erased by Wilbur's friend.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains two integers *x**i* and *y**i* (<=-<=1000<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=1000)\u00a0\u2014the coordinates of the *i*-th vertex that remains. Vertices are given in an arbitrary order.\n\nIt's guaranteed that these points are distinct vertices of some rectangle, that has positive area and which sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.. Output specification: Print the area of the initial rectangle if it could be uniquely determined by the points remaining. Otherwise, print <=-<=1.\nDemo input: ['2\\n0 0\\n1 1\\n', '1\\n1 1\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, two opposite corners of the initial rectangle are given, and that gives enough information to say that the rectangle is actually a unit square.\n\nIn the second sample there is only one vertex left and this is definitely not enough to uniquely define the area."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: The problem uses a simplified TCP/IP address model, please make sure you've read the statement attentively.\n\nPolycarpus has found a job, he is a system administrator. One day he came across *n* IP addresses. Each IP address is a 32 bit number, represented as a group of four 8-bit numbers (without leading zeroes), separated by dots. For example, the record 0.255.1.123 shows a correct IP address and records 0.256.1.123 and 0.255.1.01 do not. In this problem an arbitrary group of four 8-bit numbers is a correct IP address.\n\nHaving worked as an administrator for some time, Polycarpus learned that if you know the IP address, you can use the subnet mask to get the address of the network that has this IP addess.\n\nThe subnet mask is an IP address that has the following property: if we write this IP address as a 32 bit string, that it is representable as \"11...11000..000\". In other words, the subnet mask first has one or more one bits, and then one or more zero bits (overall there are 32 bits). For example, the IP address 2.0.0.0 is not a correct subnet mask as its 32-bit record looks as 00000010000000000000000000000000.\n\nTo get the network address of the IP address, you need to perform the operation of the bitwise \"and\" of the IP address and the subnet mask. For example, if the subnet mask is 255.192.0.0, and the IP address is 192.168.1.2, then the network address equals 192.128.0.0. In the bitwise \"and\" the result has a bit that equals 1 if and only if both operands have corresponding bits equal to one.\n\nNow Polycarpus wants to find all networks to which his IP addresses belong. Unfortunately, Polycarpus lost subnet mask. Fortunately, Polycarpus remembers that his IP addresses belonged to exactly *k* distinct networks. Help Polycarpus find the subnet mask, such that his IP addresses will belong to exactly *k* distinct networks. If there are several such subnet masks, find the one whose bit record contains the least number of ones.

Write a python script for the following problem: After the contest in comparing numbers, Shapur's teacher found out that he is a real genius and that no one could possibly do the calculations faster than him even using a super computer!\n\nSome days before the contest, the teacher took a very simple-looking exam and all his *n* students took part in the exam. The teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation.\n\nUnfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.\n\nNow the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers.\n\nShapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: \n -  As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. -  As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include \"-\", \";\" and \"_\". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. -  The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600 -  My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. -  Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN -  You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong. Do this by writing \"WA\" for Wrong answer or \"ACC\" for a correct answer. -  I should remind you that none of the strings (initial strings or answers) are empty. -  Finally, do these as soon as possible. You have less than 2 hours to complete this.\nInput specification: The first three lines contain a string each. These are the initial strings. They consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). All the initial strings have length from 1 to 100, inclusively.\n\nIn the fourth line there is a single integer *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000), the number of students.\n\nNext *n* lines contain a student's answer each. It is guaranteed that the answer meets what the teacher said. Each answer iconsists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). Length is from 1 to 600, inclusively.. Output specification: For each student write in a different line.

Besides, the keys are of two types. Some of the keys have lowercase Latin letters on them and some of the keys work like the \"Shift\" key on standard keyboards, that is, they make lowercase letters uppercase.\n\nVasya can press one or two keys with one hand. However, he can only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the keys does not exceed *x*. The keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.\n\nVasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest \"Shift\" key is strictly larger than *x*. In this case he will have to use his other hand. Having typed the symbol, Vasya returns other hand back to the chips.\n\nYou are given Vasya's keyboard and the text. Count the minimum number of times Vasya will have to use the other hand.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *x* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=30,<=1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=50).\n\nNext *n* lines contain descriptions of all the keyboard keys. Each line contains the descriptions of exactly *m* keys, without spaces. The letter keys are marked with the corresponding lowercase letters. The \"Shift\" keys are marked with the \"S\" symbol. \n\nThen follow the length of the text *q* (1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=5\u00b7105). The last line contains the text *T*, which consists of *q* symbols, which are uppercase and lowercase Latin letters..

The other letters that are on the keyboard can be printed. Those symbols come up in the text twice, thus, the answer is 2."}]}}

Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) to cell *i* using the *i*-th portal.

If there is no more paint of the color Vika wants to use now, then she stops.\n\nSquare is always painted in only one color, and it takes exactly 1 liter of paint.

Then the squares will be painted in the following colors (from left to right): 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nIn the second sample Vika can start to paint using any color.\n\nIn the third sample Vika should start painting using color number 5."}]}}

Message *a*<==<=(*a*1,<=...,<=*a**n*) is a sequence of positive integers (characters).\n\nTo compress the message Alice wants to use binary Huffman coding. We recall that binary Huffman code, or binary prefix code is a function *f*, that maps each letter that appears in the string to some binary string (that is, string consisting of characters '0' and '1' only) such that for each pair of different characters *a**i* and *a**j* string *f*(*a**i*) is not a prefix of *f*(*a**j*) (and vice versa).

Huffman codes are very useful, as the compressed message can be easily and uniquely decompressed, if the function *f* is given. Code is usually chosen in order to minimize the total length of the compressed message, i.e. the length of the string *f*(*a*1)*f*(*a*2)... *f*(*a**n*).\n\nBecause of security issues Alice doesn't want to send the whole message.

That is, letters in pairs \"a\"-\"b\" and \"b\"-\"c\" are neighbouring, while letters \"a\"-\"c\" are not. \nVasya painted the resulting graph near the string and then erased the string.

Write a python script for the following problem: Each year in the castle of Dwarven King there is a competition in growing mushrooms among the dwarves. The competition is one of the most prestigious ones, and the winner gets a wooden salad bowl. This year's event brought together the best mushroom growers from around the world, so we had to slightly change the rules so that the event gets more interesting to watch.\n\nEach mushroom grower has a mushroom that he will grow on the competition. Under the new rules, the competition consists of two parts. The first part lasts *t*1 seconds and the second part lasts *t*2 seconds. The first and the second part are separated by a little break.\n\nAfter the starting whistle the first part of the contest starts, and all mushroom growers start growing mushrooms at once, each at his individual speed of *v**i* meters per second. After *t*1 seconds, the mushroom growers stop growing mushrooms and go to have a break. During the break, for unexplained reasons, the growth of all mushrooms is reduced by *k* percent. After the break the second part of the contest starts and all mushrooms growers at the same time continue to grow mushrooms, each at his individual speed of *u**i* meters per second. After a *t*2 seconds after the end of the break, the competition ends. Note that the speeds before and after the break may vary.\n\nBefore the match dwarf Pasha learned from all participants, what two speeds they have chosen. However, the participants did not want to disclose to him all their strategy and therefore, did not say in what order they will be using these speeds. That is, if a participant chose speeds *a**i* and *b**i*, then there are two strategies: he either uses speed *a**i* before the break and speed *b**i* after it, or vice versa.\n\nDwarf Pasha really wants to win the totalizer. He knows that each participant chooses the strategy that maximizes the height of the mushroom. Help Dwarf Pasha make the final table of competition results.\n\nThe participants are sorted in the result table by the mushroom height (the participants with higher mushrooms follow earlier in the table). In case of equal mushroom heights, the participants are sorted by their numbers (the participants with a smaller number follow earlier).\nInput specification: The first input line contains four integer numbers *n*, *t*1, *t*2, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*t*1,<=*t*2<=\u2264<=1000;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of participants, the time before the break, the time after the break and the percentage, by which the mushroom growth drops during the break, correspondingly.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains two integers.

Like all the sharks, she has several rows of teeth, and feeds on crucians. One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are \"relaxing\".\n\nFor a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap).\n\nIt turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again. \n\nUnhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her. For sure, the shark couldn't say no to her favourite meal, but she had no desire to go back to the dentist. That's why she decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that the viability of no tooth becomes negative. \n\nAs Valerie is not good at mathematics, she asked you to help her to find out the total amount of crucians that she can consume for dinner.\n\nWe should remind you that while eating one crucian Valerie uses exactly one row of teeth and the viability of each tooth from this row decreases by one.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000,<=0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 total amount of Valerie's teeth, amount of tooth rows and amount of crucians in Valerie's portion for dinner.

However, she has to get an \u00abA\u00bb graduation certificate in order to apply to a prestigious one.\n\nIn school, where Noora is studying, teachers are putting down marks to the online class register, which are integers from 1 to *k*. The worst mark is 1, the best is *k*. Mark that is going to the certificate, is calculated as an average of all the marks, rounded to the closest integer. If several answers are possible, rounding up is produced. For example, 7.3 is rounded to 7, but 7.5 and 7.8784\u00a0\u2014 to 8. \n\nFor instance, if Noora has marks [8,<=9], then the mark to the certificate is 9, because the average is equal to 8.5 and rounded to 9, but if the marks are [8,<=8,<=9], Noora will have graduation certificate with 8.\n\nTo graduate with \u00abA\u00bb certificate, Noora has to have mark *k*.\n\nNoora got *n* marks in register this year. However, she is afraid that her marks are not enough to get final mark *k*. Noora decided to ask for help in the internet, where hacker Leha immediately responded to her request. He is ready to hack class register for Noora and to add Noora any number of additional marks from 1 to *k*. At the same time, Leha want his hack be unseen to everyone, so he decided to add as less as possible additional marks.

To fix it, Leha can add marks [10,\u200910,\u200910,\u200910] (4 marks in total) to the registry, achieving Noora having average mark equal to <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/1b961585522f76271546da990a6228e7c666277f.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>.

They decided to start with the name.\n\nFor this purpose the corporation has consecutively hired *m* designers. Once a company hires the *i*-th designer, he immediately contributes to the creation of a new corporation name as follows: he takes the newest version of the name and replaces all the letters *x**i* by *y**i*, and all the letters *y**i* by *x**i*.

Write a python script for the following problem: The History of Magic is perhaps the most boring subject in the Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry Potter is usually asleep during history lessons, and his magical quill writes the lectures for him. Professor Binns, the history of magic teacher, lectures in such a boring and monotonous voice, that he has a soporific effect even on the quill. That's why the quill often makes mistakes, especially in dates.\n\nSo, at the end of the semester Professor Binns decided to collect the students' parchments with notes and check them. Ron Weasley is in a panic: Harry's notes may contain errors, but at least he has some notes, whereas Ron does not have any. Ronald also has been sleeping during the lectures and his quill had been eaten by his rat Scabbers. Hermione Granger refused to give Ron her notes, because, in her opinion, everyone should learn on their own. Therefore, Ron has no choice but to copy Harry's notes.\n\nDue to the quill's errors Harry's dates are absolutely confused: the years of goblin rebellions and other important events for the wizarding world do not follow in order, and sometimes even dates from the future occur. Now Ron wants to change some of the digits while he copies the notes so that the dates were in the chronological (i.e. non-decreasing) order and so that the notes did not have any dates strictly later than 2011, or strictly before than 1000. To make the resulting sequence as close as possible to the one dictated by Professor Binns, Ron will change no more than one digit in each date into other digit. Help him do it.\nInput specification: The first input line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000). It represents the number of dates in Harry's notes. Next *n* lines contain the actual dates *y*1, *y*2, ..., *y**n*, each line contains a date. Each date is a four-digit integer (1000<=\u2264<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=9999)..

Write a python script for the following problem: Let's define the permutation of length *n* as an array *p*<==<=[*p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n*] consisting of *n* distinct integers from range from 1 to *n*. We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value *p*1, value 2 into the value *p*2 and so on.\n\nKyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a permutation. A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle). The cyclic representation is a representation of *p* as a collection of cycles forming *p*. For example, permutation *p*<==<=[4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] has a cyclic representation that looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are swapped, and 5 remains in place. \n\nPermutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya defines the standard cyclic representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first. Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation of [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] is (421)(5)(63).\n\nNow, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For instance, [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] will become [4,<=2,<=1,<=5,<=6,<=3].\n\nKyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of length *n* that do not change in a list in lexicographic order. Unfortunately, his friend Tamaki Suoh lost this list. Kyoya wishes to reproduce the list and he needs your help. Given the integers *n* and *k*, print the permutation that was *k*-th on Kyoya's list.\nInput specification: The first line will contain two integers *n*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*min*{1018,<=*l*} where *l* is the length of the Kyoya's list).. Output specification: Print *n* space-separated integers, representing the permutation that is the answer for the question.\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n', '10 1\\n'], Demo output: ['1 3 2 4\\n', '1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\\n']\nNote: The standard cycle representation is (1)(32)(4), which after removing parenthesis gives us the original permutation. The first permutation on the list would be [1,\u20092,\u20093,\u20094], while the second permutation would be [1,\u20092,\u20094,\u20093]."}]}}

A maze consists of *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* rooms, and the rooms are arranged in *n* rows (numbered from the top to the bottom starting from 1) and *m* columns (numbered from the left to the right starting from 1). The room in the *i*-th row and *j*-th column is denoted by (*i*,<=*j*). A player starts in the room (1,<=1) and wants to reach the room (*n*,<=*m*).\n\nEach room has four doors (except for ones at the maze border), one on each of its walls, and two adjacent by the wall rooms shares the same door. Some of the doors are locked, which means it is impossible to pass through the door. For example, if the door connecting (*i*,<=*j*) and (*i*,<=*j*<=+<=1) is locked, then we can't go from (*i*,<=*j*) to (*i*,<=*j*<=+<=1). Also, one can only travel between the rooms downwards (from the room (*i*,<=*j*) to the room (*i*<=+<=1,<=*j*)) or rightwards (from the room (*i*,<=*j*) to the room (*i*,<=*j*<=+<=1)) provided the corresponding door is not locked.\n\nZS the Coder considers a maze to have difficulty *x* if there is exactly *x* ways of travelling from the room (1,<=1) to the room (*n*,<=*m*). Two ways are considered different if they differ by the sequence of rooms visited while travelling.\n\nYour task is to create a maze such that its difficulty is exactly equal to *T*. In addition, ZS the Coder doesn't like large mazes, so the size of the maze and the number of locked doors are limited. Sounds simple enough, right?\nInput specification: The first and only line of the input contains a single integer *T* (1<=\u2264<=*T*<=\u2264<=1018), the difficulty of the required maze.. Output specification: The first line should contain two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=50)\u00a0\u2014 the number of rows and columns of the maze respectively.\n\nThe next line should contain a single integer *k* (0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=300)\u00a0\u2014 the number of locked doors in the maze.\n\nThen, *k* lines describing locked doors should follow. Each of them should contain four integers, *x*1,<=*y*1,<=*x*2,<=*y*2. This means that the door connecting room (*x*1,<=*y*1) and room (*x*2,<=*y*2) is locked. Note that room (*x*2,<=*y*2) should be adjacent either to the right or to the bottom of (*x*1,<=*y*1), i.e. *x*2<=+<=*y*2 should be equal to *x*1<=+<=*y*1<=+<=1. There should not be a locked door that appears twice in the list.\n\nIt is guaranteed that at least one solution exists. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['3\\n', '4\\n'], Demo output: ['3 2\\n0\\n', '4 3\\n3\\n1 2 2 2\\n3 2 3 3\\n1 3 2 3']\nNote: Here are how the sample input and output looks like. The colored arrows denotes all the possible paths while a red cross denotes a locked door.\n\nIn the first sample case:\n\nIn the second sample case:"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: The construction of subway in Bertown is almost finished! The President of Berland will visit this city soon to look at the new subway himself.\n\nThere are *n* stations in the subway. It was built according to the Bertown Transport Law:\n 1.  For each station *i* there exists exactly one train that goes from this station. Its destination station is *p**i*, possibly *p**i*<==<=*i*; 1.  For each station *i* there exists exactly one station *j* such that *p**j*<==<=*i*. \nThe President will consider the convenience of subway after visiting it. The convenience is the number of ordered pairs (*x*,<=*y*) such that person can start at station *x* and, after taking some subway trains (possibly zero), arrive at station *y* (1<=\u2264<=*x*,<=*y*<=\u2264<=*n*).\n\nThe mayor of Bertown thinks that if the subway is not convenient enough, then the President might consider installing a new mayor (and, of course, the current mayor doesn't want it to happen). Before President visits the city mayor has enough time to rebuild some paths of subway, thus changing the values of *p**i* for not more than two subway stations. Of course, breaking the Bertown Transport Law is really bad, so the subway must be built according to the Law even after changes.\n\nThe mayor wants to do these changes in such a way that the convenience of the subway is maximized.

Peter said that Bob's triangle is not right-angled, but is almost right-angled: the triangle itself is not right-angled, but it is possible to move one of the points exactly by distance 1 so, that all the coordinates remain integer, and the triangle become right-angled. Bob asks you to help him and find out if Peter tricks him. By the given coordinates of the triangle you should find out if it is right-angled, almost right-angled, or neither of these.\nInput specification: The first input line contains 6 space-separated integers *x*1,<=*y*1,<=*x*2,<=*y*2,<=*x*3,<=*y*3 \u2014 coordinates of the triangle's vertices.

Besides, the keys are of two types. Some of the keys have lowercase Latin letters on them and some of the keys work like the \"Shift\" key on standard keyboards, that is, they make lowercase letters uppercase.\n\nVasya can press one or two keys with one hand. However, he can only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the keys does not exceed *x*. The keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.\n\nVasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest \"Shift\" key is strictly larger than *x*. In this case he will have to use his other hand. Having typed the symbol, Vasya returns other hand back to the chips.\n\nYou are given Vasya's keyboard and the text.

Write a python script for the following problem: Anna and Maria are in charge of the math club for junior students. When the club gathers together, the students behave badly.

Besides, if two students are tied, then the lace connects the first student with the second one as well as the second student with the first one.\n\nTo restore order, Anna and Maria do the following. First, for each student Anna finds out what other students he is tied to. If a student is tied to exactly one other student, Anna reprimands him. Then Maria gathers in a single group all the students who have been just reprimanded. She kicks them out from the club. This group of students immediately leaves the club. These students takes with them the laces that used to tie them. Then again for every student Anna finds out how many other students he is tied to and so on.

Write a python script for the following problem: One night, having had a hard day at work, Petya saw a nightmare. There was a binary search tree in the dream. But it was not the actual tree that scared Petya. The horrifying thing was that Petya couldn't search for elements in this tree. Petya tried many times to choose key and look for it in the tree, and each time he arrived at a wrong place. Petya has been racking his brains for long, choosing keys many times, but the result was no better. But the moment before Petya would start to despair, he had an epiphany: every time he was looking for keys, the tree didn't have the key, and occured exactly one mistake. \"That's not a problem!\", thought Petya. \"Why not count the expectation value of an element, which is found when I search for the key\". The moment he was about to do just that, however, Petya suddenly woke up.\n\nThus, you are given a binary search tree, that is a tree containing some number written in the node. This number is called the node key. The number of children of every node of the tree is equal either to 0 or to 2. The nodes that have 0 children are called leaves and the nodes that have 2 children, are called inner. An inner node has the left child, that is the child whose key is less than the current node's key, and the right child, whose key is more than the current node's key. Also, a key of any node is strictly larger than all the keys of the left subtree of the node and strictly smaller than all the keys of the right subtree of the node.\n\nAlso you are given a set of search keys, all of which are distinct and differ from the node keys contained in the tree. For each key from the set its search in the tree is realised. The search is arranged like this: initially we are located in the tree root, if the key of the current node is larger that our search key, then we move to the left child of the node, otherwise we go to the right child of the node and the process is repeated. As it is guaranteed that the search key is not contained in the tree, the search will always finish in some leaf. The key lying in the leaf is declared the search result.\n\nIt is known for sure that during the search we make a mistake in comparing exactly once, that is we go the wrong way, but we won't make any mistakes later. All possible mistakes are equiprobable, that is we should consider all such searches where exactly one mistake occurs. Your task is to find the expectation (the average value) of the search result for every search key, considering that exactly one mistake occurs in the search. That is, for a set of paths containing exactly one mistake in the given key search, you should count the average value of keys containing in the leaves of those paths.\nInput specification: The first line contains an odd integer *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=&lt;<=105), which represents the number of tree nodes. Next *n* lines contain node descriptions. The (*i*<=+<=1)-th line contains two space-separated integers. The first number is the number of parent of the *i*-st node and the second number is the key lying in the *i*-th node. The next line contains an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=105), which represents the number of keys for which you should count the average value of search results containing one mistake. Next *k* lines contain the actual keys, one key per line.\n\nAll node keys and all search keys are positive integers, not exceeding 109. All *n*<=+<=*k* keys are distinct.\n\nAll nodes are numbered from 1 to *n*. For the tree root \"-1\" (without the quote) will be given instead of the parent's node number. It is guaranteed that the correct binary search tree is given. For each node except for the root, it could be determined according to its key whether it is the left child or the right one.. Output specification: Print *k* real numbers which are the expectations of answers for the keys specified in the input. The answer should differ from the correct one with the measure of absolute or relative error not exceeding 10<=-<=9.\nDemo input: ['7\\n-1 8\\n1 4\\n1 12\\n2 2\\n2 6\\n3 10\\n3 14\\n1\\n1\\n', '3\\n-1 5\\n1 3\\n1 7\\n6\\n1\\n2\\n4\\n6\\n8\\n9\\n'], Demo output: ['8.0000000000\\n', '7.0000000000\\n7.0000000000\\n7.0000000000\\n3.0000000000\\n3.0000000000\\n3.0000000000\\n']\nNote: In the first sample the search of key 1 with one error results in two paths in the trees: (1, 2, 5) and (1, 3, 6), in parentheses are listed numbers of nodes from the root to a leaf. The keys in the leaves of those paths are equal to 6 and 10 correspondingly, that's why the answer is equal to 8."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Anya and Kirill are doing a physics laboratory work. In one of the tasks they have to measure some value *n* times, and then compute the average value to lower the error.\n\nKirill has already made his measurements, and has got the following integer values: *x*1, *x*2, ..., *x**n*. It is important that the values are close to each other, namely, the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value is at most 2.\n\nAnya does not want to make the measurements, however, she can't just copy the values from Kirill's work, because the error of each measurement is a random value, and this coincidence will be noted by the teacher. Anya wants to write such integer values *y*1, *y*2, ..., *y**n* in her work, that the following conditions are met:\n -  the average value of *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n* is equal to the average value of *y*1,<=*y*2,<=...,<=*y**n*;-  all Anya's measurements are in the same bounds as all Kirill's measurements, that is, the maximum value among Anya's values is not greater than the maximum value among Kirill's values, and the minimum value among Anya's values is not less than the minimum value among Kirill's values;-  the number of equal measurements in Anya's work and Kirill's work is as small as possible among options with the previous conditions met. Formally, the teacher goes through all Anya's values one by one, if there is equal value in Kirill's work and it is not strike off yet, he strikes off this Anya's value and one of equal values in Kirill's work. The number of equal measurements is then the total number of strike off values in Anya's work. \nHelp Anya to write such a set of measurements that the conditions above are met.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000) \u2014 the numeber of measurements made by Kirill.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n* (<=-<=100<=000<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=100<=000) \u2014 the measurements made by Kirill. It is guaranteed that the difference between the maximum and minimum values among values *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n* does not exceed 2.. Output specification: In the first line print the minimum possible number of equal measurements.\n\nIn the second line print *n* integers *y*1,<=*y*2,<=...,<=*y**n* \u2014 the values Anya should write. You can print the integers in arbitrary order. Keep in mind that the minimum value among Anya's values should be not less that the minimum among Kirill's values, and the maximum among Anya's values should be not greater than the maximum among Kirill's values.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['6\\n-1 1 1 0 0 -1\\n', '3\\n100 100 101\\n', '7\\n-10 -9 -10 -8 -10 -9 -9\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n0 0 0 0 0 0 \\n', '3\\n101 100 100 \\n', '5\\n-10 -10 -9 -9 -9 -9 -9 \\n']\nNote: In the first example Anya can write zeros as here measurements results. The average value is then equal to the average value of Kirill's values, and there are only two equal measurements.\n\nIn the second example Anya should write two values 100 and one value 101 (in any order), because it is the only possibility to make the average be the equal to the average of Kirill's values. Thus, all three measurements are equal.\n\nIn the third example the number of equal measurements is 5."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Ford Prefect got a job as a web developer for a small company that makes towels. His current work task is to create a search engine for the website of the company. During the development process, he needs to write a subroutine for comparing strings *S* and *T* of equal length to be \"similar\". After a brief search on the Internet, he learned about the Hamming distance between two strings *S* and *T* of the same length, which is defined as the number of positions in which *S* and *T* have different characters. For example, the Hamming distance between words \"permanent\" and \"pergament\" is two, as these words differ in the fourth and sixth letters.\n\nMoreover, as he was searching for information, he also noticed that modern search engines have powerful mechanisms to correct errors in the request to improve the quality of search. Ford doesn't know much about human beings, so he assumed that the most common mistake in a request is swapping two arbitrary letters of the string (not necessarily adjacent). Now he wants to write a function that determines which two letters should be swapped in string *S*, so that the Hamming distance between a new string *S* and string *T* would be as small as possible, or otherwise, determine that such a replacement cannot reduce the distance between the strings.\n\nHelp him do this!\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200<=000) \u2014 the length of strings *S* and *T*.\n\nThe second line contains string *S*.\n\nThe third line contains string *T*.\n\nEach of the lines only contains lowercase Latin letters..

Write a python script for the following problem: Bob is a farmer. He has a large pasture with many sheep. Recently, he has lost some of them due to wolf attacks. He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of dogs.\nDemo input: ['6 6\\n..S...\\n..S.W.\\n.S....\\n..W...\\n...W..\\n......\\n', '1 2\\nSW\\n', '5 5\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS....\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n..SD..\\n..SDW.\\n.SD...\\n.DW...\\nDD.W..\\n......\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS.D..\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n']\nNote: In the first example, we can split the pasture into two halves, one containing wolves and one containing sheep. Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: How many specific orders do you know? Ascending order, descending order, order of ascending length, order of ascending polar angle... Let's have a look at another specific order: *d*-sorting. This sorting is applied to the strings of length at least *d*, where *d* is some positive integer. The characters of the string are sorted in following manner: first come all the 0-th characters of the initial string, then the 1-st ones, then the 2-nd ones and so on, in the end go all the (*d*<=-<=1)-th characters of the initial string. By the *i*-th characters we mean all the character whose positions are exactly *i* modulo *d*. If two characters stand on the positions with the same remainder of integer division by *d*, their relative order after the sorting shouldn't be changed. The string is zero-indexed. For example, for string 'qwerty':\n\nIts 1-sorting is the string 'qwerty' (all characters stand on 0 positions),\n\nIts 2-sorting is the string 'qetwry' (characters 'q', 'e' and 't' stand on 0 positions and characters 'w', 'r' and 'y' are on 1 positions),\n\nIts 3-sorting is the string 'qrwtey' (characters 'q' and 'r' stand on 0 positions, characters 'w' and 't' stand on 1 positions and characters 'e' and 'y' stand on 2 positions),\n\nIts 4-sorting is the string 'qtwyer',\n\nIts 5-sorting is the string 'qywert'.\n\nYou are given string *S* of length *n* and *m* shuffling operations of this string. Each shuffling operation accepts two integer arguments *k* and *d* and transforms string *S* as follows. For each *i* from 0 to *n*<=-<=*k* in the increasing order we apply the operation of *d*-sorting to the substring *S*[*i*..*i*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1]. Here *S*[*a*..*b*] represents a substring that consists of characters on positions from *a* to *b* inclusive.\n\nAfter each shuffling operation you need to print string *S*.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains a non-empty string *S* of length *n*, consisting of lowercase and uppercase English letters and digits from 0 to 9. \n\nThe second line of the input contains integer *m*\u00a0\u2013 the number of shuffling operations (1<=\u2264<=*m*\u00b7*n*<=\u2264<=106). \n\nFollowing *m* lines contain the descriptions of the operations consisting of two integers *k* and *d* (1<=\u2264<=*d*<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*)..

The first modification is executed with arguments *k*\u2009=\u20094, *d*\u2009=\u20092. That means that you need to apply 2-sorting for each substring of length 4 one by one moving from the left to the right.

Write a python script for the following problem: *T* is a complete binary tree consisting of *n* vertices. It means that exactly one vertex is a root, and each vertex is either a leaf (and doesn't have children) or an inner node (and has exactly two children). All leaves of a complete binary tree have the same depth (distance from the root). So *n* is a number such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nIn the picture you can see a complete binary tree with *n*<==<=15.\n\nVertices are numbered from 1 to *n* in a special recursive way: we recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the left subtree (if current vertex is not a leaf), then assign a number to the current vertex, and then recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the right subtree (if it exists). In the picture vertices are numbered exactly using this algorithm. It is clear that for each size of a complete binary tree exists exactly one way to give numbers to all vertices. This way of numbering is called symmetric.\n\nYou have to write a program that for given *n* answers *q* queries to the tree.\n\nEach query consists of an integer number *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) and a string *s**i*, where *u**i* is the number of vertex, and *s**i* represents the path starting from this vertex. String *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U', which mean traverse to the left child, to the right child and to the parent, respectively. Characters from *s**i* have to be processed from left to right, considering that *u**i* is the vertex where the path starts. If it's impossible to process a character (for example, to go to the left child of a leaf), then you have to skip it. The answer is the number of vertex where the path represented by *s**i* ends.\n\nFor example, if *u**i*<==<=4 and *s**i*<==<=\u00abUURL\u00bb, then the answer is 10.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integer numbers *n* and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1018, *q*<=\u2265<=1). *n* is such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nThe next 2*q* lines represent queries; each query consists of two consecutive lines.

The first character of the slogan must be in the first square (the leftmost) of the poster, the second character must be in the second square, and so on.\n\nOf course, the R1 programmers want to write the slogan on the poster themselves. To do this, they have a large (and a very heavy) ladder which was put exactly opposite the *k*-th square of the poster. To draw the *i*-th character of the slogan on the poster, you need to climb the ladder, standing in front of the *i*-th square of the poster. This action (along with climbing up and down the ladder) takes one hour for a painter. The painter is not allowed to draw characters in the adjacent squares when the ladder is in front of the *i*-th square because the uncomfortable position of the ladder may make the characters untidy. Besides, the programmers can move the ladder. In one hour, they can move the ladder either a meter to the right or a meter to the left.\n\nDrawing characters and moving the ladder is very tiring, so the programmers want to finish the job in as little time as possible.

In other words he can learn a chapter of a particular subject in *x* hours.\n\nWell Devu is not complete dumb, there is a good thing about him too. If you teach him a subject, then time required to teach any chapter of the next subject will require exactly 1 hour less than previously required (see the examples to understand it more clearly). Note that his per chapter learning power can not be less than 1 hour.\n\nYou can teach him the *n* subjects in any possible order. Find out minimum amount of time (in hours) Devu will take to understand all the subjects and you will be free to do some enjoying task rather than teaching a dumb guy.\n\nPlease be careful that answer might not fit in 32 bit data type.\nInput specification: The first line will contain two space separated integers *n*, *x* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*x*<=\u2264<=105). The next line will contain *n* space separated integers: *c*1,<=*c*2,<=...,<=*c**n* (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=105)..

Consider the order of subjects: 1, 2. When you teach Devu the first subject, it will take him 3 hours per chapter, so it will take 12 hours to teach first subject. After teaching first subject, his per chapter learning time will be 2 hours. Now teaching him second subject will take 2\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009=\u20092 hours. Hence you will need to spend 12\u2009+\u20092\u2009=\u200914 hours.\n\nConsider the order of subjects: 2, 1. When you teach Devu the second subject, then it will take him 3 hours per chapter, so it will take 3\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009=\u20093 hours to teach the second subject. After teaching the second subject, his per chapter learning time will be 2 hours. Now teaching him the first subject will take 2\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009=\u20098 hours. Hence you will need to spend 11 hours.\n\nSo overall, minimum of both the cases is 11 hours.\n\nLook at the third example. The order in this example doesn't matter. When you teach Devu the first subject, it will take him 3 hours per chapter. When you teach Devu the second subject, it will take him 2 hours per chapter. When you teach Devu the third subject, it will take him 1 hours per chapter. In total it takes 6 hours."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: One particularly well-known fact about zombies is that they move and think terribly slowly. While we still don't know why their movements are so sluggish, the problem of laggy thinking has been recently resolved. It turns out that the reason is not (as previously suspected) any kind of brain defect \u2013 it's the opposite! Independent researchers confirmed that the nervous system of a zombie is highly complicated \u2013 it consists of *n* brains (much like a cow has several stomachs). They are interconnected by brain connectors, which are veins capable of transmitting thoughts between brains. There are two important properties such a brain network should have to function properly: \n 1.  It should be possible to exchange thoughts between any two pairs of brains (perhaps indirectly, through other brains). 1.  There should be no redundant brain connectors, that is, removing any brain connector would make property 1 false. \nIf both properties are satisfied, we say that the nervous system is valid. Unfortunately (?), if the system is not valid, the zombie stops thinking and becomes (even more) dead.

From time to time they have a break to have some food or do some chores (for example, water the flowers).\n\nThe key in football is to divide into teams fairly before the game begins. There are *n* boys playing football in the yard (including Petya), each boy's football playing skill is expressed with a non-negative characteristic *a**i* (the larger it is, the better the boy plays). \n\nLet's denote the number of players in the first team as *x*, the number of players in the second team as *y*, the individual numbers of boys who play for the first team as *p**i* and the individual numbers of boys who play for the second team as *q**i*. Division *n* boys into two teams is considered fair if three conditions are fulfilled:\n -  Each boy plays for exactly one team (*x*<=+<=*y*<==<=*n*). -  The sizes of teams differ in no more than one (|*x*<=-<=*y*|<=\u2264<=1). -  The total football playing skills for two teams differ in no more than by the value of skill the best player in the yard has.

For example, each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform and guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well.

Then the second team players do the same, based on the choice of their opponents.\n\nWe will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.\n\nThe teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally.

To make the dubstep remix of this song, Vasya inserts a certain number of words \"WUB\" before the first word of the song (the number may be zero), after the last word (the number may be zero), and between words (at least one between any pair of neighbouring words), and then the boy glues together all the words, including \"WUB\", in one string and plays the song at the club.\n\nFor example, a song with words \"I AM X\" can transform into a dubstep remix as \"WUBWUBIWUBAMWUBWUBX\" and cannot transform into \"WUBWUBIAMWUBX\".\n\nRecently, Petya has heard Vasya's new dubstep track, but since he isn't into modern music, he decided to find out what was the initial song that Vasya remixed.

Write a python script for the following problem: Nowadays, most of the internet advertisements are not statically linked to a web page. Instead, what will be shown to the person opening a web page is determined within 100 milliseconds after the web page is opened. Usually, multiple companies compete for each ad slot on the web page in an auction. Each of them receives a request with details about the user, web page and ad slot and they have to respond within those 100 milliseconds with a bid they would pay for putting an advertisement on that ad slot. The company that suggests the highest bid wins the auction and gets to place its advertisement. If there are several companies tied for the highest bid, the winner gets picked at random.\n\nHowever, the company that won the auction does not have to pay the exact amount of its bid. In most of the cases, a second-price auction is used. This means that the amount paid by the company is equal to the maximum of all the other bids placed for this ad slot.\n\nLet's consider one such bidding. There are *n* companies competing for placing an ad. The *i*-th of these companies will bid an integer number of microdollars equiprobably randomly chosen from the range between *L**i* and *R**i*, inclusive. In the other words, the value of the *i*-th company bid can be any integer from the range [*L**i*,<=*R**i*] with the same probability. \n\nDetermine the expected value that the winner will have to pay in a second-price auction.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains an integer number *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=5). *n* lines follow, the *i*-th of them containing two numbers *L**i* and *R**i* (1<=\u2264<=*L**i*<=\u2264<=*R**i*<=\u2264<=10000) describing the *i*-th company's bid preferences.\n\nThis problem doesn't have subproblems. You will get 8 points for the correct submission.. Output specification: Output the answer with absolute or relative error no more than 1*e*<=-<=9.\nDemo input: ['3\\n4 7\\n8 10\\n5 5\\n', '3\\n2 5\\n3 4\\n1 6\\n'], Demo output: ['5.7500000000\\n', '3.5000000000\\n']\nNote: Consider the first example. The first company bids a random integer number of microdollars in range [4,\u20097]; the second company bids between 8 and 10, and the third company bids 5 microdollars. The second company will win regardless of the exact value it bids, however the price it will pay depends on the value of first company's bid. With probability 0.5 the first company will bid at most 5 microdollars, and the second-highest price of the whole auction will be 5. With probability 0.25 it will bid 6 microdollars, and with probability 0.25 it will bid 7 microdollars. Thus, the expected value the second company will have to pay is 0.5\u00b75\u2009+\u20090.25\u00b76\u2009+\u20090.25\u00b77\u2009=\u20095.75."}]}}

Unfortunately, all soldiers died in the war and now the army consists of entirely new recruits, many of whom do not even know from which leg they should begin to march. The civilian population also poorly understands from which leg recruits begin to march, so it is only important how many soldiers march in step.\n\nThere will be *n* columns participating in the parade, the *i*-th column consists of *l**i* soldiers, who start to march from left leg, and *r**i* soldiers, who start to march from right leg.\n\nThe beauty of the parade is calculated by the following formula: if *L* is the total number of soldiers on the parade who start to march from the left leg, and *R* is the total number of soldiers on the parade who start to march from the right leg, so the beauty will equal |*L*<=-<=*R*|.\n\nNo more than once you can choose one column and tell all the soldiers in this column to switch starting leg, i.e. everyone in this columns who starts the march from left leg will now start it from right leg, and vice versa. Formally, you can pick no more than one index *i* and swap values *l**i* and *r**i*. \n\nFind the index of the column, such that switching the starting leg for soldiers in it will maximize the the beauty of the parade, or determine, that no such operation can increase the current beauty.\nInput specification: The first line contains single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of columns. \n\nThe next *n* lines contain the pairs of integers *l**i* and *r**i* (1<=\u2264<=*l**i*,<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=500)\u00a0\u2014 the number of soldiers in the *i*-th column which start to march from the left or the right leg respectively.. Output specification: Print single integer *k*\u00a0\u2014 the number of the column in which soldiers need to change the leg from which they start to march, or 0 if the maximum beauty is already reached.\n\nConsider that columns are numbered from 1 to *n* in the order they are given in the input data.\n\nIf there are several answers, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['3\\n5 6\\n8 9\\n10 3\\n', '2\\n6 5\\n5 6\\n', '6\\n5 9\\n1 3\\n4 8\\n4 5\\n23 54\\n12 32\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n', '1\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: In the first example if you don't give the order to change the leg, the number of soldiers, who start to march from the left leg, would equal 5\u2009+\u20098\u2009+\u200910\u2009=\u200923, and from the right leg\u00a0\u2014 6\u2009+\u20099\u2009+\u20093\u2009=\u200918.

Before the first turn all the field cells are empty. The two players take turns placing their signs into empty cells (the first player places Xs, the second player places Os). The player who places Xs goes first, the another one goes second. The winner is the player who first gets three of his signs in a row next to each other (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).\nInput specification: The tic-tac-toe position is given in four lines.\n\nEach of these lines contains four characters. Each character is '.' (empty cell), 'x' (lowercase English letter x), or 'o' (lowercase English letter o). It is guaranteed that the position is reachable playing tic-tac-toe, and it is Ilya's turn now (in particular, it means that the game is not finished). It is possible that all the cells are empty, it means that the friends left without making single turn.. Output specification: Print single line: \"YES\" in case Ilya could have won by making single turn, and \"NO\" otherwise.\nDemo input: ['xx..\\n.oo.\\nx...\\noox.\\n', 'x.ox\\nox..\\nx.o.\\noo.x\\n', 'x..x\\n..oo\\no...\\nx.xo\\n', 'o.x.\\no...\\n.x..\\nooxx\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n', 'YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: In the first example Ilya had two winning moves: to the empty cell in the left column and to the leftmost empty cell in the first row.\n\nIn the second example it wasn't possible to win by making single turn.\n\nIn the third example Ilya could have won by placing X in the last row between two existing Xs.\n\nIn the fourth example it wasn't possible to win by making single turn."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Vasya adores sport programming. He can't write programs but he loves to watch the contests' progress. Vasya even has a favorite coder and Vasya pays special attention to him.\n\nOne day Vasya decided to collect the results of all contests where his favorite coder participated and track the progress of his coolness. For each contest where this coder participated, he wrote out a single non-negative number \u2014 the number of points his favorite coder earned in the contest. Vasya wrote out the points for the contest in the order, in which the contests run (naturally, no two contests ran simultaneously).\n\nVasya considers a coder's performance in a contest amazing in two situations: he can break either his best or his worst performance record. First, it is amazing if during the contest the coder earns strictly more points that he earned on each past contest. Second, it is amazing if during the contest the coder earns strictly less points that he earned on each past contest. A coder's first contest isn't considered amazing. Now he wants to count the number of amazing performances the coder had throughout his whole history of participating in contests. But the list of earned points turned out long and Vasya can't code... That's why he asks you to help him.\nInput specification: The first line contains the single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the number of contests where the coder participated.\n\nThe next line contains *n* space-separated non-negative integer numbers \u2014 they are the points which the coder has earned. The points are given in the chronological order. All points do not exceed 10000..

She offered the students a string consisting of *n* small Latin letters; the task was to learn the way the letters that the string contains are written. However, as Gerald is too lazy, he has no desire whatsoever to learn those letters. That's why he decided to lose some part of the string (not necessarily a connected part). The lost part can consist of any number of segments of any length, at any distance from each other. However, Gerald knows that if he loses more than *k* characters, it will be very suspicious. \n\nFind the least number of distinct characters that can remain in the string after no more than *k* characters are deleted. You also have to find any possible way to delete the characters.\nInput specification: The first input data line contains a string whose length is equal to *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105). The string consists of lowercase Latin letters. The second line contains the number *k* (0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=105)..

Classic chess doesn't seem interesting to him, so he plays his own sort of chess.\n\nThe queen is the piece that captures all squares on its vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines. If the cell is located on the same vertical, horizontal or diagonal line with queen, and the cell contains a piece of the enemy color, the queen is able to move to this square. After that the enemy's piece is removed from the board. The queen cannot move to a cell containing an enemy piece if there is some other piece between it and the queen. \n\nThere is an *n*<=\u00d7<=*n* chessboard. We'll denote a cell on the intersection of the *r*-th row and *c*-th column as (*r*,<=*c*). The square (1,<=1) contains the white queen and the square (1,<=*n*) contains the black queen. All other squares contain green pawns that don't belong to anyone.\n\nThe players move in turns. The player that moves first plays for the white queen, his opponent plays for the black queen.\n\nOn each move the player has to capture some piece with his queen (that is, move to a square that contains either a green pawn or the enemy queen). The player loses if either he cannot capture any piece during his move or the opponent took his queen during the previous move. \n\nHelp Vasya determine who wins if both players play with an optimal strategy on the board *n*<=\u00d7<=*n*.\nInput specification: The input contains a single number *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the size of the board..

If there are multiple such cells, print the one with the minimum *r*. If there are still multiple squares, print the one with the minimum *c*.\nDemo input: ['2\\n', '3\\n'], Demo output: ['white\\n1 2\\n', 'black\\n']\nNote: In the first sample test the white queen can capture the black queen at the first move, so the white player wins.\n\nIn the second test from the statement if the white queen captures the green pawn located on the central vertical line, then it will be captured by the black queen during the next move. So the only move for the white player is to capture the green pawn located at (2,\u20091). \n\nSimilarly, the black queen doesn't have any other options but to capture the green pawn located at (2,\u20093), otherwise if it goes to the middle vertical line, it will be captured by the white queen.\n\nDuring the next move the same thing happens \u2014 neither the white, nor the black queen has other options rather than to capture green pawns situated above them. Thus, the white queen ends up on square (3,\u20091), and the black queen ends up on square (3,\u20093). \n\nIn this situation the white queen has to capture any of the green pawns located on the middle vertical line, after that it will be captured by the black queen.

Recently they discovered an interesting acoustic characteristic of this ridge: if Rick and Morty begin crying simultaneously from different mountains, their cry would be heard between these mountains up to the height equal the bitwise OR of mountains they've climbed and all the mountains between them. \n\nBitwise OR is a binary operation which is determined the following way. Consider representation of numbers *x* and *y* in binary numeric system (probably with leading zeroes) *x*<==<=*x**k*... *x*1*x*0 and *y*<==<=*y**k*... *y*1*y*0. Then *z*<==<=*x*\u00a0|\u00a0*y* is defined following way: *z*<==<=*z**k*... *z*1*z*0, where *z**i*<==<=1, if *x**i*<==<=1 or *y**i*<==<=1, and *z**i*<==<=0 otherwise. In the other words, digit of bitwise OR of two numbers equals zero if and only if digits at corresponding positions is both numbers equals zero. For example bitwise OR of numbers 10<==<=10102 and 9<==<=10012 equals 11<==<=10112. In programming languages C/C++/Java/Python this operation is defined as \u00ab|\u00bb, and in Pascal as \u00abor\u00bb.\n\nHelp Rick and Morty calculate the number of ways they can select two mountains in such a way that if they start crying from these mountains their cry will be heard above these mountains and all mountains between them.

Berland scientists think that the big bang will happen at the first collision of particles, whose velocities differs in directions. Help them to determine how much time elapses after the launch of the collider before the big bang happens.\nInput specification: The first line contains single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=5\u00b7105) \u2014 amount of particles in the collider. Next *n* lines contain description of particles. Each particle is described by two integers *x**i*, *v**i* (<=-<=109<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=109,<=*v**i*<=\u2260<=0) \u2014 coordinate and velocity respectively. All the coordinates are distinct. The particles are listed in order of increasing of coordinates. All the coordinates are in meters, and all the velocities \u2014 in meters per second. The negative velocity means that after the start of collider the particle will move to the left, and the positive \u2014 that the particle will move to the right.. Output specification: If there will be no big bang, output -1. Otherwise output one number \u2014 how much time in seconds elapses after the launch of the collider before the big bang happens.

Write a python script for the following problem: Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.\n\nShop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following *n* days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in *i*-th day *k**i* products will be put up for sale and exactly *l**i* clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any *f* days from *n* next for sell-outs. On each of *f* chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on *i*-th day shop planned to put up for sale *k**i* products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7*k**i* products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.\n\nNoora's task is to choose *f* days to maximize total number of sold products.

The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) portal connects cell *i* and cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*), and one can travel from cell *i* to cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) using the *i*-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) to cell *i* using the *i*-th portal.

For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\n\nVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads \u2014 major and minor.\n\nLet's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes *X*, *Y* and *Z*. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between *X* and *Y* equals 4 semitones and the distance between *Y* and *Z* is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between *X* and *Z*, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.\n\nA minor triad is different in that the distance between *X* and *Y* should be 3 semitones and between *Y* and *Z* \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nFor example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nHelp Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\nInput specification: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.. Output specification: Print \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\nDemo input: ['C E G\\n', 'C# B F\\n', 'A B H\\n'], Demo output: ['major\\n', 'minor\\n', 'strange\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

In particular, he wants to split the initial *n* in several parts *n*1<=+<=*n*2<=+<=...<=+<=*n**k*<==<=*n* (here *k* is arbitrary, even *k*<==<=1 is allowed) and pay the taxes for each part separately. He can't make some part equal to 1 because it will reveal him. So, the condition *n**i*<=\u2265<=2 should hold for all *i* from 1 to *k*.\n\nOstap Bender wonders, how many money Funt has to pay (i.e. minimal) if he chooses and optimal way to split *n* in parts.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7109)\u00a0\u2014 the total year income of mr.

Write a python script for the following problem: Katya studies in a fifth grade. Recently her class studied right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem. It appeared, that there are triples of positive integers such that you can construct a right triangle with segments of lengths corresponding to triple. Such triples are called Pythagorean triples.\n\nFor example, triples (3,<=4,<=5), (5,<=12,<=13) and (6,<=8,<=10) are Pythagorean triples.\n\nHere Katya wondered if she can specify the length of some side of right triangle and find any Pythagorean triple corresponding to such length?

He is more impressed by the idea to transmit two-dimensional objects through three-dimensional objects by using his magnificent sculptures. And his new project is connected with this. Cicasso wants to make a coat for the haters of anticubism.

Cicasso does not want to leave the unused rods, so the sculptor decides to make another rod-blank with an integer length so that his problem is solvable.

That is, letters in pairs \"a\"-\"b\" and \"b\"-\"c\" are neighbouring, while letters \"a\"-\"c\" are not. \nVasya painted the resulting graph near the string and then erased the string. Next day Vasya's friend Petya came to a lecture and found some graph at his desk. He had heard of Vasya's adventure and now he wants to find out whether it could be the original graph *G*, painted by Vasya.

Write a python script for the following problem: Each year in the castle of Dwarven King there is a competition in growing mushrooms among the dwarves. The competition is one of the most prestigious ones, and the winner gets a wooden salad bowl. This year's event brought together the best mushroom growers from around the world, so we had to slightly change the rules so that the event gets more interesting to watch.\n\nEach mushroom grower has a mushroom that he will grow on the competition. Under the new rules, the competition consists of two parts. The first part lasts *t*1 seconds and the second part lasts *t*2 seconds. The first and the second part are separated by a little break.\n\nAfter the starting whistle the first part of the contest starts, and all mushroom growers start growing mushrooms at once, each at his individual speed of *v**i* meters per second. After *t*1 seconds, the mushroom growers stop growing mushrooms and go to have a break. During the break, for unexplained reasons, the growth of all mushrooms is reduced by *k* percent. After the break the second part of the contest starts and all mushrooms growers at the same time continue to grow mushrooms, each at his individual speed of *u**i* meters per second. After a *t*2 seconds after the end of the break, the competition ends. Note that the speeds before and after the break may vary.\n\nBefore the match dwarf Pasha learned from all participants, what two speeds they have chosen. However, the participants did not want to disclose to him all their strategy and therefore, did not say in what order they will be using these speeds. That is, if a participant chose speeds *a**i* and *b**i*, then there are two strategies: he either uses speed *a**i* before the break and speed *b**i* after it, or vice versa.\n\nDwarf Pasha really wants to win the totalizer. He knows that each participant chooses the strategy that maximizes the height of the mushroom. Help Dwarf Pasha make the final table of competition results.\n\nThe participants are sorted in the result table by the mushroom height (the participants with higher mushrooms follow earlier in the table). In case of equal mushroom heights, the participants are sorted by their numbers (the participants with a smaller number follow earlier).\nInput specification: The first input line contains four integer numbers *n*, *t*1, *t*2, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*t*1,<=*t*2<=\u2264<=1000;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of participants, the time before the break, the time after the break and the percentage, by which the mushroom growth drops during the break, correspondingly.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains two integers. The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) line contains space-separated integers *a**i*, *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the speeds which the participant number *i* chose.. Output specification: Print the final results' table: *n* lines, each line should contain the number of the corresponding dwarf and the final maximum height of his mushroom with exactly two digits after the decimal point.

Write a python script for the following problem: Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective.

Let's assume that Misha chose number *m*, and Andrew chose number *a*.\n\nThen, by using a random generator they choose a random integer *c* in the range between 1 and *n* (any integer from 1 to *n* is chosen with the same probability), after which the winner is the player, whose number was closer to *c*. The boys agreed that if *m* and *a* are located on the same distance from *c*, Misha wins.\n\nAndrew wants to win very much, so he asks you to help him.

Write a python script for the following problem: There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: \n -  alloc n \u2014 to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; \nThe memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.\n\nThe first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager.
