Then, your final score *s* will be equal to the number of values of *j* between 1 and *k* such that *k*<=\u2264<=*a**p**j*.\n\nYou have guessed that the real first problem of the exam is already in front of you. Therefore, you want to choose a set of problems to solve during the exam maximizing your final score in advance. Don't forget that the exam is limited in time, and you must have enough time to solve all chosen problems. If there exist different sets of problems leading to the maximum final score, any of them will do.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *T* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105; 1<=\u2264<=*T*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 the number of problems in the exam and the length of the exam in milliseconds, respectively.\n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains two integers *a**i* and *t**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*; 1<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=104). The problems are numbered from 1 to *n*.. Output specification: In the first line, output a single integer *s*\u00a0\u2014 your maximum possible final score.\n\nIn the second line, output a single integer *k* (0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of problems you should solve.\n\nIn the third line, output *k* distinct integers *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**k* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the indexes of problems you should solve, in any order.\n\nIf there are several optimal sets of problems, you may output any of them.\nDemo input: ['5 300\\n3 100\\n4 150\\n4 80\\n2 90\\n2 300\\n', '2 100\\n1 787\\n2 788\\n', '2 100\\n2 42\\n2 58\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n3\\n3 1 4\\n', '0\\n0\\n\\n', '2\\n2\\n1 2\\n']\nNote: In the first example, you should solve problems 3, 1, and 4. In this case you'll spend 80\u2009+\u2009100\u2009+\u200990\u2009=\u2009270 milliseconds, falling within the length of the exam, 300 milliseconds (and even leaving yourself 30 milliseconds to have a rest). Problems 3 and 1 will bring you a point each, while problem 4 won't. You'll score two points.\n\nIn the second example, the length of the exam is catastrophically not enough to solve even a single problem.\n\nIn the third example, you have just enough time to solve both problems in 42\u2009+\u200958\u2009=\u2009100 milliseconds and hand your solutions to the teacher with a smile."}]}}

A network topology is the way of describing the network configuration, the scheme that shows the location and the connections of network devices.\n\nPolycarpus knows three main network topologies: bus, ring and star. A bus is the topology that represents a shared cable with all computers connected with it. In the ring topology the cable connects each computer only with two other ones. A star is the topology where all computers of a network are connected to the single central node.\n\nLet's represent each of these network topologies as a connected non-directed graph. A bus is a connected graph that is the only path, that is, the graph where all nodes are connected with two other ones except for some two nodes that are the beginning and the end of the path. A ring is a connected graph, where all nodes are connected with two other ones. A star is a connected graph, where a single central node is singled out and connected with all other nodes. For clarifications, see the picture.\n\nYou've got a connected non-directed graph that characterizes the computer network in Polycarpus' corporation.

In total, there are *n* tasks for the day and each animal should do each of these tasks. For each task, they have evaluated its difficulty. Also animals decided to do the tasks in order of their difficulty. Unfortunately, some tasks can have the same difficulty, so the order in which one can perform the tasks may vary.\n\nMenshykov, Uslada and Horace ask you to deal with this nuisance and come up with individual plans for each of them. The plan is a sequence describing the order in which an animal should do all the *n* tasks. Besides, each of them wants to have its own unique plan. Therefore three plans must form three different sequences. You are to find the required plans, or otherwise deliver the sad news to them by stating that it is impossible to come up with three distinct plans for the given tasks.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2000) \u2014 the number of tasks.

The log was written in the following format: \u00ab[date:time]: message\u00bb, where for each \u00ab[date:time]\u00bb value existed not more than 10 lines. All the files were encoded in a very complicated manner, and only one programmer \u2014 Alex \u2014 managed to decode them. The code was so complicated that Alex needed four weeks to decode it. Right after the decoding process was finished, all the files were deleted. But after the files deletion, Alex noticed that he saved the recordings in format \u00ab[time]: message\u00bb. So, information about the dates was lost. However, as the lines were added into the log in chronological order, it's not difficult to say if the recordings could appear during one day or not. It is possible also to find the minimum amount of days during which the log was written.\n\nSo, to make up for his mistake Alex has to find the minimum amount of days covered by the log. Note that Alex doesn't have to find the minimum amount of days between the beginning and the end of the logging, he has to find the minimum amount of dates in which records could be done. (See Sample test 2 for further clarifications).\n\nWe should remind you that the process made not more than 10 recordings in a minute. Consider that a midnight belongs to coming day.\nInput specification: The first input line contains number *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100). The following *n* lines contain recordings in format \u00ab[time]: message\u00bb, where time is given in format \u00abhh:mm x.m.\u00bb. For hh two-digit numbers from 01 to 12 are used, for mm two-digit numbers from 00 to 59 are used, and x is either character \u00aba\u00bb or character \u00abp\u00bb. A message is a non-empty sequence of Latin letters and/or spaces, it doesn't start or end with a space. The length of each message doesn't exceed 20.. Output specification: Output one number \u2014 the minimum amount of days covered by the log.\nDemo input: ['5\\n[05:00 a.m.]: Server is started\\n[05:00 a.m.]: Rescan initialized\\n[01:13 p.m.]: Request processed\\n[01:10 p.m.]: Request processed\\n[11:40 p.m.]: Rescan completed\\n', '3\\n[09:00 a.m.]: User logged in\\n[08:00 a.m.]: User logged in\\n[07:00 a.m.]: User logged in\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '3\\n']\nNote: Formally the 12-hour time format is described at: \n -  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock."}]}}

The body can be considered as a material point with coordinates (0; 0; 0). Vasya had only to answer whether it is in equilibrium. \"Piece of cake\" \u2014 thought Vasya, we need only to check if the sum of all vectors is equal to 0. So, Vasya began to solve the problem. But later it turned out that there can be lots and lots of these forces, and Vasya can not cope without your help. Help him. Write a program that determines whether a body is idle or is moving by the given vectors of forces.\nInput specification: The first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), then follow *n* lines containing three integers each: the *x**i* coordinate, the *y**i* coordinate and the *z**i* coordinate of the force vector, applied to the body (<=-<=100<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*,<=*z**i*<=\u2264<=100).. Output specification: Print the word \"YES\" if the body is in equilibrium, or the word \"NO\" if it is not.\nDemo input: ['3\\n4 1 7\\n-2 4 -1\\n1 -5 -3\\n', '3\\n3 -1 7\\n-5 2 -4\\n2 -1 -3\\n'], Demo output: ['NO', 'YES']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Limak is a little polar bear. Polar bears hate long strings and thus they like to compress them. You should also know that Limak is so young that he knows only first six letters of the English alphabet: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' and 'f'.\n\nYou are given a set of *q* possible operations. Limak can perform them in any order, any operation may be applied any number of times. The *i*-th operation is described by a string *a**i* of length two and a string *b**i* of length one. No two of *q* possible operations have the same string *a**i*.\n\nWhen Limak has a string *s* he can perform the *i*-th operation on *s* if the first two letters of *s* match a two-letter string *a**i*. Performing the *i*-th operation removes first two letters of *s* and inserts there a string *b**i*. See the notes section for further clarification.\n\nYou may note that performing an operation decreases the length of a string *s* exactly by 1. Also, for some sets of operations there may be a string that cannot be compressed any further, because the first two letters don't match any *a**i*.\n\nLimak wants to start with a string of length *n* and perform *n*<=-<=1 operations to finally get a one-letter string \"a\". In how many ways can he choose the starting string to be able to get \"a\"? Remember that Limak can use only letters he knows.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *q* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=6, 1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=36)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the initial string and the number of available operations.\n\nThe next *q* lines describe the possible operations. The *i*-th of them contains two strings *a**i* and *b**i* (|*a**i*|<==<=2,<=|*b**i*|<==<=1). It's guaranteed that *a**i*<=\u2260<=*a**j* for *i*<=\u2260<=*j* and that all *a**i* and *b**i* consist of only first six lowercase English letters.. Output specification: Print the number of strings of length *n* that Limak will be able to transform to string \"a\" by applying only operations given in the input.\nDemo input: ['3 5\\nab a\\ncc c\\nca a\\nee c\\nff d\\n', '2 8\\naf e\\ndc d\\ncc f\\nbc b\\nda b\\neb a\\nbb b\\nff c\\n', '6 2\\nbb a\\nba a\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n', '1\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, we count initial strings of length 3 from which Limak can get a required string \"a\". There are 4 such strings: \"abb\", \"cab\", \"cca\", \"eea\". The first one Limak can compress using operation 1 two times (changing \"ab\" to a single \"a\"). The first operation would change \"abb\" to \"ab\" and the second operation would change \"ab\" to \"a\".\n\nOther three strings may be compressed as follows: \n -  \"cab\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ab\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"a\" -  \"cca\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ca\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"a\" -  \"eea\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ca\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"a\" \nIn the second sample, the only correct initial string is \"eb\" because it can be immediately compressed to \"a\"."}]}}

Guests from all over the kingdom gather here to discuss new trends in the world of confectionery. Yet some of the things discussed here are not supposed to be disclosed to the general public: the information can cause discord in the kingdom of Sweetland in case it turns out to reach the wrong hands. So it's a necessity to not let any uninvited guests in.\n\nThere are 26 entrances in Jelly Castle, enumerated with uppercase English letters from A to Z. Because of security measures, each guest is known to be assigned an entrance he should enter the castle through. The door of each entrance is opened right before the first guest's arrival and closed right after the arrival of the last guest that should enter the castle through this entrance. No two guests can enter the castle simultaneously.\n\nFor an entrance to be protected from possible intrusion, a candy guard should be assigned to it. There are *k* such guards in the castle, so if there are more than *k* opened doors, one of them is going to be left unguarded! Notice that a guard can't leave his post until the door he is assigned to is closed.\n\nSlastyona had a suspicion that there could be uninvited guests at the evening.

Now Vasya has to choose a base *p* and regard the expression as written in the base *p* positional notation. Vasya understood that he can get different results with different bases, and some bases are even invalid. For example, expression 78<=+<=87 in the base 16 positional notation is equal to *FF*16, in the base 15 positional notation it is equal to 11015, in the base 10 one \u2014 to 16510, in the base 9 one \u2014 to 1769, and in the base 8 or lesser-based positional notations the expression is invalid as all the numbers should be strictly less than the positional notation base. Vasya got interested in what is the length of the longest possible expression value.

You can go from the first room to the second room, from the second room to the third room and so on \u2014 you can go from the (*n*<=-<=1)-th room to the *n*-th room. Thus, you can go to room *x* only from room *x*<=-<=1.\n\nThe potato pie is located in the *n*-th room and Vitaly needs to go there. \n\nEach pair of consecutive rooms has a door between them. In order to go to room *x* from room *x*<=-<=1, you need to open the door between the rooms with the corresponding key. \n\nIn total the house has several types of doors (represented by uppercase Latin letters) and several types of keys (represented by lowercase Latin letters). The key of type *t* can open the door of type *T* if and only if *t* and *T* are the same letter, written in different cases.

They are going to compete in a race with a distance of *L* meters today.\n\nWillman and Bolt have exactly the same speed, so when they compete the result is always a tie. That is a problem for the organizers because they want a winner. \n\nWhile watching previous races the organizers have noticed that Willman can perform only steps of length equal to *w* meters, and Bolt can perform only steps of length equal to *b* meters. Organizers decided to slightly change the rules of the race. Now, at the end of the racetrack there will be an abyss, and the winner will be declared the athlete, who manages to run farther from the starting point of the the racetrack (which is not the subject to change by any of the athletes). \n\nNote that none of the athletes can run infinitely far, as they both will at some moment of time face the point, such that only one step further will cause them to fall in the abyss. In other words, the athlete will not fall into the abyss if the total length of all his steps will be less or equal to the chosen distance *L*.\n\nSince the organizers are very fair, the are going to set the length of the racetrack as an integer chosen randomly and uniformly in range from 1 to *t* (both are included). What is the probability that Willman and Bolt tie again today?\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains three integers *t*, *w* and *b* (1<=\u2264<=*t*,<=*w*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=5\u00b71018) \u2014 the maximum possible length of the racetrack, the length of Willman's steps and the length of Bolt's steps respectively..

In this problem your task is to help a company design a new stadium. \n\nThe city of N has a shabby old stadium. Many people like it and every morning thousands of people come out to this stadium to run. The stadium can be represented as a circle, its length is exactly *l* meters with a marked start line. However, there can't be simultaneous start in the morning, so exactly at 7, each runner goes to his favorite spot on the stadium and starts running from there. Note that not everybody runs in the same manner as everybody else. Some people run in the clockwise direction, some of them run in the counter-clockwise direction. It mostly depends on the runner's mood in the morning, so you can assume that each running direction is equiprobable for each runner in any fixed morning. \n\nThe stadium is tiny and is in need of major repair, for right now there only is one running track! You can't get too playful on a single track, that's why all runners keep the same running speed \u2014 exactly 1 meter per a time unit. Nevertheless, the runners that choose different directions bump into each other as they meet. \n\nThe company wants to design a new stadium, but they first need to know how bad the old one is. For that they need the expectation of the number of bumpings by *t* time units after the running has begun. Help the company count the required expectation. Note that each runner chooses a direction equiprobably, independently from the others and then all runners start running simultaneously at 7 a.m. Assume that each runner runs for *t* time units without stopping. Consider the runners to bump at a certain moment if at that moment they found themselves at the same point in the stadium.

If the second runner run counter-clockwise direction then in 1 time unit he will be also 1m away from the start line. And it is the only possible way to meet.

Write a python script for the following problem: Your friend has *n* cards.\n\nYou know that each card has a lowercase English letter on one side and a digit on the other.\n\nCurrently, your friend has laid out the cards on a table so only one side of each card is visible.\n\nYou would like to know if the following statement is true for cards that your friend owns: \"If a card has a vowel on one side, then it has an even digit on the other side.\" More specifically, a vowel is one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' or 'u', and even digit is one of '0', '2', '4', '6' or '8'.\n\nFor example, if a card has 'a' on one side, and '6' on the other side, then this statement is true for it. Also, the statement is true, for example, for a card with 'b' and '4', and for a card with 'b' and '3' (since the letter is not a vowel). The statement is false, for example, for card with 'e' and '5'. You are interested if the statement is true for all cards. In particular, if no card has a vowel, the statement is true.\n\nTo determine this, you can flip over some cards to reveal the other side. You would like to know what is the minimum number of cards you need to flip in the worst case in order to verify that the statement is true.\nInput specification: The first and only line of input will contain a string *s* (1<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=50), denoting the sides of the cards that you can see on the table currently.

However, the trains run with different frequencies: a train goes to Dasha's direction every *a* minutes, but a train goes to Masha's direction every *b* minutes. If two trains approach at the same time, Vasya goes toward the direction with the lower frequency of going trains, that is, to the girl, to whose directions the trains go less frequently (see the note to the third sample).\n\nWe know that the trains begin to go simultaneously before Vasya appears.

Write a python script for the following problem: By 2312 there were *n* Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*).. Output specification: Print *m* lines \u2014 the results of executing requests in the above given format. The requests should be processed in the order, in which they are given in the input.

Write a python script for the following problem: In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.\n\nThere are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.\n\nOfficer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:\n -  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$; -  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. \nFor example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\n\nThe structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.\n\nFormally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.\n\nBerland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.\n\nSuppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ \u2014 one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.\n\nLet's look at the following example:\n\nIf officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.\n\nIf officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.\n\nTo answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.\n\nYou should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i &lt; i$), where $p_i$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $i$. The commander has index $1$ and doesn't have any superiors.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query is given as a pair ($u_i, k_i$) ($1 \\le u_i, k_i \\le n$), where $u_i$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $k_i$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence.. Output specification: Print $q$ numbers, where the $i$-th number is the officer at the position $k_i$ in the list which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if it starts spreading from officer $u_i$. Print \"-1\" if the number of officers which receive the command is less than $k_i$.\n\nYou should process queries independently. They do not affect each other.\nDemo input: ['9 6\\n1 1 1 3 5 3 5 7\\n3 1\\n1 5\\n3 4\\n7 3\\n1 8\\n1 9\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n6\\n8\\n-1\\n9\\n4\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

However, Vasilisa the Wise does not know what the box's secret is, since she cannot open it again. She hopes that you will help her one more time with that.\n\nThe box's lock looks as follows: it contains 4 identical deepenings for gems as a 2<=\u00d7<=2 square, and some integer numbers are written at the lock's edge near the deepenings. The example of a lock is given on the picture below.\n\nThe box is accompanied with 9 gems. Their shapes match the deepenings' shapes and each gem contains one number from 1 to 9 (each number is written on exactly one gem). The box will only open after it is decorated with gems correctly: that is, each deepening in the lock should be filled with exactly one gem. Also, the sums of numbers in the square's rows, columns and two diagonals of the square should match the numbers written at the lock's edge. For example, the above lock will open if we fill the deepenings with gems with numbers as is shown on the picture below.\n\nNow Vasilisa the Wise wants to define, given the numbers on the box's lock, which gems she should put in the deepenings to open the box.

He has invented an algorithm and called it \"Mishka's Adjacent Replacements Algorithm\". This algorithm can be represented as a sequence of steps:\n -  Replace each occurrence of $1$ in the array $a$ with $2$; -  Replace each occurrence of $2$ in the array $a$ with $1$; -  Replace each occurrence of $3$ in the array $a$ with $4$; -  Replace each occurrence of $4$ in the array $a$ with $3$; -  Replace each occurrence of $5$ in the array $a$ with $6$; -  Replace each occurrence of $6$ in the array $a$ with $5$; -  $\\dots$ -  Replace each occurrence of $10^9 - 1$ in the array $a$ with $10^9$; -  Replace each occurrence of $10^9$ in the array $a$ with $10^9 - 1$. \nNote that the dots in the middle of this algorithm mean that Mishka applies these replacements for each pair of adjacent integers ($2i - 1, 2i$) for each $i \\in\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 5 \\cdot 10^8\\}$ as described above.\n\nFor example, for the array $a = [1, 2, 4, 5, 10]$, the following sequence of arrays represents the algorithm: \n\n$[1, 2, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $1$ with $2$) $\\rightarrow$ $[2, 2, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $2$ with $1$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $3$ with $4$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $4$ with $3$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $5$ with $6$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 6, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $6$ with $5$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ $\\dots$ $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $10$ with $9$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 9]$.

Her friend Dasha told Masha about a way to determine the phone number of one's Prince Charming through arithmancy. \n\nThe phone number is divined like that. First one needs to write down one's own phone numbers. For example, let's suppose that Masha's phone number is 12345. After that one should write her favorite digit from 0 to 9 under the first digit of her number. That will be the first digit of the needed number. For example, Masha's favorite digit is 9. The second digit is determined as a half sum of the second digit of Masha's number and the already written down first digit from her beloved one's number. In this case the arithmetic average equals to (2<=+<=9)<=/<=2<==<=5.5. Masha can round the number up or down, depending on her wishes. For example, she chooses the digit 5. Having written down the resulting digit under the second digit of her number, Masha moves to finding the third digit in the same way, i.e. finding the half sum the the third digit of her number and the second digit of the new number. The result is (5<=+<=3)<=/<=2<==<=4. In this case the answer is unique. Thus, every *i*-th digit is determined as an arithmetic average of the *i*-th digit of Masha's number and the *i*<=-<=1-th digit of her true love's number.

The computer network of this corporation consists of *n* computers, some of them are connected by a cable. The computers are indexed by integers from 1 to *n*. It's known that any two computers connected by cable directly or through other computers\n\nPolycarpus decided to find out the network's topology. A network topology is the way of describing the network configuration, the scheme that shows the location and the connections of network devices.\n\nPolycarpus knows three main network topologies: bus, ring and star. A bus is the topology that represents a shared cable with all computers connected with it. In the ring topology the cable connects each computer only with two other ones. A star is the topology where all computers of a network are connected to the single central node.\n\nLet's represent each of these network topologies as a connected non-directed graph. A bus is a connected graph that is the only path, that is, the graph where all nodes are connected with two other ones except for some two nodes that are the beginning and the end of the path. A ring is a connected graph, where all nodes are connected with two other ones. A star is a connected graph, where a single central node is singled out and connected with all other nodes. For clarifications, see the picture.\n\nYou've got a connected non-directed graph that characterizes the computer network in Polycarpus' corporation. Help him find out, which topology type the given network is.

There is at most one edge between any two nodes. No edge connects a node with itself.. Output specification: In a single line print the network topology name of the given graph.

You need to transform word *s* into word *t*\". The task looked simple to the guys because they know the suffix data structures well. Bizon Senior loves suffix automaton.

Write a python script for the following problem: In Disgaea as in most role-playing games, characters have skills that determine the character's ability to use certain weapons or spells. If the character does not have the necessary skill, he cannot use it. The skill level is represented as an integer that increases when you use this skill. Different character classes are characterized by different skills. \n\nUnfortunately, the skills that are uncommon for the given character's class are quite difficult to obtain. To avoid this limitation, there is the so-called transmigration. \n\nTransmigration is reincarnation of the character in a new creature. His soul shifts to a new body and retains part of his experience from the previous life. \n\nAs a result of transmigration the new character gets all the skills of the old character and the skill levels are reduced according to the *k* coefficient (if the skill level was equal to *x*, then after transmigration it becomes equal to [*kx*], where [*y*] is the integral part of *y*). If some skill's levels are strictly less than 100, these skills are forgotten (the character does not have them any more). After that the new character also gains the skills that are specific for his class, but are new to him. The levels of those additional skills are set to 0. \n\nThus, one can create a character with skills specific for completely different character classes via transmigrations. For example, creating a mage archer or a thief warrior is possible. \n\nYou are suggested to solve the following problem: what skills will the character have after transmigration and what will the levels of those skills be?\nInput specification: The first line contains three numbers *n*, *m* and *k* \u2014 the number of skills the current character has, the number of skills specific for the class into which the character is going to transmigrate and the reducing coefficient respectively; *n* and *m* are integers, and *k* is a real number with exactly two digits after decimal point (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=20, 0.01<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=0.99).\n\nThen follow *n* lines, each of which describes a character's skill in the form \"*name* *exp*\" \u2014 the skill's name and the character's skill level: *name* is a string and *exp* is an integer in range from 0 to 9999, inclusive. \n\nThen follow *m* lines each of which contains names of skills specific for the class, into which the character transmigrates. \n\nAll names consist of lowercase Latin letters and their lengths can range from 1 to 20 characters, inclusive. All character's skills have distinct names. Besides the skills specific for the class into which the player transmigrates also have distinct names.. Output specification: Print on the first line number *z* \u2014 the number of skills the character will have after the transmigration. Then print *z* lines, on each of which print a skill's name and level, separated by a single space.

We can denote sections with pairs of integers $(i, j)$, where $i$ is the floor, and $j$ is the section number on the floor.\n\nThe guests can walk along the corridor on each floor, use stairs and elevators. Each stairs or elevator occupies all sections $(1, x)$, $(2, x)$, $\\ldots$, $(n, x)$ for some $x$ between $1$ and $m$. All sections not occupied with stairs or elevators contain guest rooms. It takes one time unit to move between neighboring sections on the same floor or to move one floor up or down using stairs.

That is, it should have exactly *n* rooms and, if a corridor from room *i* to room *j* existed in the old house, it should be built in the new one. \n\nWe know that during the house constructing process Arnie starts to eat an apple starting from some room and only stops when he eats his way through all the corridors and returns to the starting room. It is also known that Arnie eats without stopping. That is, until Arnie finishes constructing the house, he is busy every moment of his time gnawing a new corridor. Arnie doesn't move along the already built corridors.\n\nHowever, gnawing out corridors in one and the same order any time you change a house is a very difficult activity. That's why Arnie, knowing the order in which the corridors were located in the previous house, wants to gnaw corridors in another order. It is represented as a list of rooms in the order in which they should be visited. The new list should be lexicographically smallest, but it also should be strictly lexicographically greater than the previous one. Help the worm.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100,<=3<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=2000). It is the number of rooms and corridors in Arnie's house correspondingly. The next line contains *m*<=+<=1 positive integers that do not exceed *n*. They are the description of Arnie's old path represented as a list of rooms he visited during the gnawing. It is guaranteed that the last number in the list coincides with the first one.\n\nThe first room described in the list is the main entrance, that's why Arnie should begin gnawing from it.\n\nYou may assume that there is no room which is connected to itself and there is at most one corridor between any pair of rooms. However, it is possible to find some isolated rooms which are disconnected from others.. Output specification: Print *m*<=+<=1 positive integers that do not exceed *n*. Those numbers are the description of the new path, according to which Arnie should gnaw out his new house. If it is impossible to find new path you should print out No solution. The first number in your answer should be equal to the last one. Also it should be equal to the main entrance.\nDemo input: ['3 3\\n1 2 3 1\\n', '3 3\\n1 3 2 1\\n'], Demo output: ['1 3 2 1 ', 'No solution']\nNote: none"}]}}

To do this, he repeatedly takes the top card from the deck, and if the number on it equals the minimum number written on the cards in the deck, then he places the card away. Otherwise, he puts it under the deck and takes the next card from the top, and so on. The process ends as soon as there are no cards in the deck. You can assume that Vasily always knows the minimum number written on some card in the remaining deck, but doesn't know where this card (or these cards) is.\n\nYou are to determine the total number of times Vasily takes the top card from the deck.\nInput specification: The first line contains single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000) \u2014 the number of cards in the deck.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100<=000), where *a**i* is the number written on the *i*-th from top card in the deck.. Output specification: Print the total number of times Vasily takes the top card from the deck.\nDemo input: ['4\\n6 3 1 2\\n', '1\\n1000\\n', '7\\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3\\n'], Demo output: ['7\\n', '1\\n', '7\\n']\nNote: In the first example Vasily at first looks at the card with number 6 on it, puts it under the deck, then on the card with number 3, puts it under the deck, and then on the card with number 1. He places away the card with 1, because the number written on it is the minimum among the remaining cards. After that the cards from top to bottom are [2,\u20096,\u20093]. Then Vasily looks at the top card with number 2 and puts it away. After that the cards from top to bottom are [6,\u20093]. Then Vasily looks at card 6, puts it under the deck, then at card 3 and puts it away. Then there is only one card with number 6 on it, and Vasily looks at it and puts it away. Thus, in total Vasily looks at 7 cards."}]}}

If we split string *a* into two halves of the same size *a*1 and *a*2, and string *b* into two halves of the same size *b*1 and *b*2, then one of the following is correct:   *a*1 is equivalent to *b*1, and *a*2 is equivalent to *b*2 1.  *a*1 is equivalent to *b*2, and *a*2 is equivalent to *b*1 \nAs a home task, the teacher gave two strings to his students and asked to determine if they are equivalent.\n\nGerald has already completed this home task. Now it's your turn!\nInput specification: The first two lines of the input contain two strings given by the teacher. Each of them has the length from 1 to 200<=000 and consists of lowercase English letters. The strings have the same length.. Output specification: Print \"YES\" (without the quotes), if these two strings are equivalent, and \"NO\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\nDemo input: ['aaba\\nabaa\\n', 'aabb\\nabab\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: In the first sample you should split the first string into strings \"aa\" and \"ba\", the second one \u2014 into strings \"ab\" and \"aa\". \"aa\" is equivalent to \"aa\"; \"ab\" is equivalent to \"ba\" as \"ab\" = \"a\" + \"b\", \"ba\" = \"b\" + \"a\".\n\nIn the second sample the first string can be splitted into strings \"aa\" and \"bb\", that are equivalent only to themselves. That's why string \"aabb\" is equivalent only to itself and to string \"bbaa\"."}]}}

You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two.

After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins.

If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too. You can pick coins with values 1,\u20092 or 2,\u20092. In any case, the minimum number of coins equals 2."}]}}

Unfortunately, author's solution of the original problem appeared wrong, so the problem was changed specially for the archive.\n\nOnce upon a time in a far away kingdom lived the King. The King had a beautiful daughter, Victoria. They lived happily, but not happily ever after: one day a vicious dragon attacked the kingdom and stole Victoria. The King was full of grief, yet he gathered his noble knights and promised half of his kingdom and Victoria's hand in marriage to the one who will save the girl from the infernal beast.\n\nHaving travelled for some time, the knights found the dragon's lair and all of them rushed there to save Victoria. Each knight spat on the dragon once and, as the dragon had quite a fragile and frail heart, his heart broke and poor beast died. As for the noble knights, they got Victoria right to the King and started brawling as each one wanted the girl's hand in marriage.\n\nThe problem was that all the noble knights were equally noble and equally handsome, and Victoria didn't want to marry any of them anyway. Then the King (and he was a very wise man and didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings) decided to find out who will get his daughter randomly, i.e. tossing a coin. However, there turned out to be *n* noble knights and the coin only has two sides. The good thing is that when a coin is tossed, the coin falls on each side with equal probability. The King got interested how to pick one noble knight using this coin so that all knights had equal probability of being chosen (the probability in that case should always be equal to 1<=/<=*n*). First the King wants to know the expected number of times he will need to toss a coin to determine the winner. Besides, while tossing the coin, the King should follow the optimal tossing strategy (i.e. the strategy that minimizes the expected number of tosses). Help the King in this challenging task.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* from the problem's statement (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=10000)..

The distance between two vertices is the number of edges in a simple path between them.\n\nLimak is a little polar bear. He lives in a tree that consists of *n* vertices, numbered 1 through *n*.\n\nLimak recently learned how to jump. He can jump from a vertex to any vertex within distance at most *k*.\n\nFor a pair of vertices (*s*,<=*t*) we define *f*(*s*,<=*t*) as the minimum number of jumps Limak needs to get from *s* to *t*. Your task is to find the sum of *f*(*s*,<=*t*) over all pairs of vertices (*s*,<=*t*) such that *s*<=&lt;<=*t*.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200<=000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=5)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices in the tree and the maximum allowed jump distance respectively.\n\nThe next *n*<=-<=1 lines describe edges in the tree.

Limak can jump to any vertex within distance at most 2. For example, from the vertex 5 he can jump to any of vertices: 1, 2 and 4 (well, he can also jump to the vertex 5 itself).\n\nThere are <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/c0295201207e28a36e641d8cf599f45986059e71.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> pairs of vertices (*s*,\u2009*t*) such that *s*\u2009&lt;\u2009*t*.

So, the answer is 5\u00b72\u2009+\u200910\u00b71\u2009=\u200920.\n\nIn the third sample, Limak can jump between every two vertices directly.

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the elements of array. \n\nThe third line contains integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs. Separate the numbers by spaces.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nDemo input: ['2\\n1 2\\n1\\n1\\n', '2\\n2 1\\n1\\n1\\n', '3\\n3 1 2\\n3\\n1 2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['1 2\\n', '2 1\\n', '6 6\\n']\nNote: In the first sample Vasya's approach will make one comparison (it starts with the 1-st element and immediately finds the required number), and Petya's approach makes two comparisons (first he compares with the 2-nd array element, doesn't find the search item and compares with the 1-st element).\n\nIn the second sample, on the contrary, Vasya's approach will need two comparisons (first with 1-st element, and then with the 2-nd), and Petya's approach will find the required value in one comparison (the first comparison with the 2-nd element)."}]}}

She also has put a robot at each end of the row (to the left of the first number and to the right of the last number). Sonya will give a number to each robot (they can be either same or different) and run them. When a robot is running, it is moving toward to another robot, reading numbers in the row. When a robot is reading a number that is equal to the number that was given to that robot, it will turn off and stay in the same position.\n\nSonya does not want robots to break, so she will give such numbers that robots will stop before they meet.

In that case, robots will not meet each other. As a result, robots will not be broken. But if Sonya gives the number $4$ to the first robot and the number $5$ to the second one, they will meet since the first robot will stop in the $3$-rd position while the second one is in the $2$-nd position.\n\nSonya understands that it does not make sense to give a number that is not written in the row because a robot will not find this number and will meet the other robot.\n\nSonya is now interested in finding the number of different pairs that she can give to robots so that they will not meet. In other words, she wants to know the number of pairs ($p$, $q$), where she will give $p$ to the first robot and $q$ to the second one. Pairs ($p_i$, $q_i$) and ($p_j$, $q_j$) are different if $p_i\\neq p_j$ or $q_i\\neq q_j$.\n\nUnfortunately, Sonya is busy fixing robots that broke after a failed launch.

They were quite dear to him and the boy didn't want to throw them away. Petya conjured a cunning plan: he will glue all the spiders together and attach them to the ceiling. Besides, Petya knows that the lower the spiders will hang, the more mum is going to like it and then she won't throw his favourite toys away. Help Petya carry out the plan.\n\nA spider consists of *k* beads tied together by *k*<=-<=1 threads.

However, Vasilisa the Wise does not know what the box's secret is, since she cannot open it again. She hopes that you will help her one more time with that.\n\nThe box's lock looks as follows: it contains 4 identical deepenings for gems as a 2<=\u00d7<=2 square, and some integer numbers are written at the lock's edge near the deepenings. The example of a lock is given on the picture below.\n\nThe box is accompanied with 9 gems. Their shapes match the deepenings' shapes and each gem contains one number from 1 to 9 (each number is written on exactly one gem). The box will only open after it is decorated with gems correctly: that is, each deepening in the lock should be filled with exactly one gem. Also, the sums of numbers in the square's rows, columns and two diagonals of the square should match the numbers written at the lock's edge. For example, the above lock will open if we fill the deepenings with gems with numbers as is shown on the picture below.\n\nNow Vasilisa the Wise wants to define, given the numbers on the box's lock, which gems she should put in the deepenings to open the box. Help Vasilisa to solve this challenging task.\nInput specification: The input contains numbers written on the edges of the lock of the box. The first line contains space-separated integers *r*1 and *r*2 that define the required sums of numbers in the rows of the square. The second line contains space-separated integers *c*1 and *c*2 that define the required sums of numbers in the columns of the square.

Correspondence between the above 6 variables and places where they are written is shown on the picture below. For more clarifications please look at the second sample test that demonstrates the example given in the problem statement.. Output specification: Print the scheme of decorating the box with stones: two lines containing two space-separated integers from 1 to 9. The numbers should be pairwise different.

Write a python script for the following problem: The mayor of the Berland city S sees the beauty differently than other city-dwellers. In particular, he does not understand at all, how antique houses can be nice-looking. So the mayor wants to demolish all ancient buildings in the city.\n\nThe city S is going to host the football championship very soon. In order to make the city beautiful, every month the Berland government provides mayor a money tranche. The money has to be spent on ancient buildings renovation.\n\nThere are *n* months before the championship and the *i*-th month tranche equals to *a**i* burles. The city S has *m* antique buildings and the renovation cost of the *j*-th building is *b**j* burles.\n\nThe mayor has his own plans for spending the money. As he doesn't like antique buildings he wants to demolish as much of them as possible. For the *j*-th building he calculated its demolishing cost *p**j*.\n\nThe mayor decided to act according to the following plan.\n\nEach month he chooses several (possibly zero) of *m* buildings to demolish in such a way that renovation cost of each of them separately is not greater than the money tranche *a**i* of this month (*b**j*<=\u2264<=*a**i*)\u00a0\u2014 it will allow to deceive city-dwellers that exactly this building will be renovated.\n\nThen the mayor has to demolish all selected buildings during the current month as otherwise the dwellers will realize the deception and the plan will fail. Definitely the total demolishing cost can not exceed amount of money the mayor currently has. The mayor is not obliged to spend all the money on demolishing. If some money is left, the mayor puts it to the bank account and can use it in any subsequent month. Moreover, at any month he may choose not to demolish any buildings at all (in this case all the tranche will remain untouched and will be saved in the bank).\n\nYour task is to calculate the maximal number of buildings the mayor can demolish.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of months before the championship and the number of ancient buildings in the city S.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109), where *a**i* is the tranche of the *i*-th month.\n\nThe third line contains *m* integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**j*<=\u2264<=109), where *b**j* is renovation cost of the *j*-th building.\n\nThe fourth line contains *m* integers *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**m* (1<=\u2264<=*p**j*<=\u2264<=109), where *p**j* is the demolishing cost of the *j*-th building..

He spends all the money on it.\n\nAfter getting the second month tranche of 3 burles, the mayor selects only building #1 (renovation cost 3, demolishing cost 1) for demolishing. As a result, he saves 2 burles for the next months.\n\nIn the third month he gets 2 burle tranche, but decides not to demolish any buildings at all. As a result, he has 2\u2009+\u20092\u2009=\u20094 burles in the bank.\n\nThis reserve will be spent on the fourth month together with the 4-th tranche for demolishing of houses #3 and #5 (renovation cost is 4 for each, demolishing costs are 3 and 5 correspondingly). After this month his budget is empty.\n\nFinally, after getting the last tranche of 3 burles, the mayor demolishes building #6 (renovation cost 2, demolishing cost 3).\n\nAs it can be seen, he demolished all 6 buildings."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: There are some ambiguities when one writes Berland names with the letters of the Latin alphabet.\n\nFor example, the Berland sound u can be written in the Latin alphabet as \"u\", and can be written as \"oo\". For this reason, two words \"ulyana\" and \"oolyana\" denote the same name.\n\nThe second ambiguity is about the Berland sound h: one can use both \"h\" and \"kh\" to write it. For example, the words \"mihail\" and \"mikhail\" denote the same name.\n\nThere are *n* users registered on the Polycarp's website. Each of them indicated a name represented by the Latin letters. How many distinct names are there among them, if two ambiguities described above are taken into account?\n\nFormally, we assume that two words denote the same name, if using the replacements \"u\"\u00a0\u00a0\"oo\" and \"h\"\u00a0\u00a0\"kh\", you can make the words equal. One can make replacements in both directions, in any of the two words an arbitrary number of times. A letter that resulted from the previous replacement can participate in the next replacements.\n\nFor example, the following pairs of words denote the same name:\n -  \"koouper\" and \"kuooper\". Making the replacements described above, you can make both words to be equal: \"koouper\"  \"kuuper\" and \"kuooper\"  \"kuuper\". -  \"khun\" and \"kkkhoon\". With the replacements described above you can make both words to be equal: \"khun\"  \"khoon\" and \"kkkhoon\"  \"kkhoon\"  \"khoon\". \nFor a given list of words, find the minimal number of groups where the words in each group denote the same name.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer number *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=400) \u2014 number of the words in the list.\n\nThe following *n* lines contain words, one word per line. Each word consists of only lowercase Latin letters. The length of each word is between 1 and 20 letters inclusive..

Words in each group denote same name:\n 1.  \"mihail\", \"mikhail\" 1.  \"oolyana\", \"ulyana\" 1.  \"kooooper\", \"koouper\" 1.  \"hoon\", \"khun\", \"kkkhoon\" \nThere are five groups of words in the second example. Words in each group denote same name:\n 1.  \"hariton\", \"kkkhariton\", \"khariton\" 1.  \"hkariton\" 1.  \"buoi\", \"boooi\", \"boui\" 1.  \"bui\" 1.  \"boi\" \nIn the third example the words are equal, so they denote the same name."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Little Petya is learning to play chess. He has already learned how to move a king, a rook and a bishop. Let us remind you the rules of moving chess pieces. A chessboard is 64 square fields organized into an 8<=\u00d7<=8 table. A field is represented by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*) \u2014 the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:\n -  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically. -  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally. -  A king moves one field in any direction \u2014 horizontally, vertically or diagonally. \nPetya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2)? At that, we assume that there are no more pieces besides this one on the board. Help him solve this problem.\nInput specification: The input contains four integers *r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2 (1<=\u2264<=*r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2<=\u2264<=8) \u2014 the coordinates of the starting and the final field.

Output specification: Print three space-separated integers: the minimum number of moves the rook, the bishop and the king (in this order) is needed to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2). If a piece cannot make such a move, print a 0 instead of the corresponding number.\nDemo input: ['4 3 1 6\\n', '5 5 5 6\\n'], Demo output: ['2 1 3\\n', '1 0 1\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.\n\nOne day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.\nInput specification: There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number. It is guaranteed that the numbers are made from 0 and 1 only and that their length is same. The numbers may start with 0. The length of each number doesn't exceed 100..

Crucial moment is just around the corner: Gogol is ready to release it's new tablet Lastus 3000.\n\nThis new device is equipped with specially designed artificial intelligence (AI). Employees of Pineapple did their best to postpone the release of Lastus 3000 as long as possible.

As all rights on its name belong to Pineapple, they stand on changing the name of Gogol's artificial intelligence.\n\nPineapple insists, that the name of their phone occurs in the name of AI as a substring. Because the name of technology was already printed on all devices, the Gogol's director decided to replace some characters in AI name with \"#\".

Let us remind you the rules of moving chess pieces. A chessboard is 64 square fields organized into an 8<=\u00d7<=8 table. A field is represented by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*) \u2014 the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:\n -  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically. -  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally. -  A king moves one field in any direction \u2014 horizontally, vertically or diagonally. \nPetya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2)? At that, we assume that there are no more pieces besides this one on the board.

Write a python script for the following problem: The only difference from the previous problem is the constraint on the number of requests. In this problem your program should guess the answer doing at most 7 requests.\n\nThis problem is a little bit unusual. Here you are to implement an interaction with a testing system. That means that you can make queries and get responses in the online mode. Please be sure to use the stream flushing operation after each query's output in order not to leave part of your output in some buffer. For example, in C++ you've got to use the fflush(stdout) function, in Java \u2014 call System.out.flush(), and in Pascal \u2014 flush(output).\n\nBulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls or Bulls and Cleots) is an old code-breaking paper and pencil game for two players, predating the similar commercially marketed board game Mastermind.\n\nOn a sheet of paper, the first player thinks a secret string. This string consists only of digits and has the length 4. The digits in the string must be all different, no two or more equal digits are allowed.\n\nThen the second player tries to guess his opponent's string. For every guess the first player gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are on their right positions, they are \"bulls\", if on different positions, they are \"cows\". Thus a response is a pair of numbers \u2014 the number of \"bulls\" and the number of \"cows\". A try can contain equal digits.\n\nMore formally, let's the secret string is *s* and the second player are trying to guess it with a string *x*. The number of \"bulls\" is a number of such positions *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=4) where *s*[*i*]<==<=*x*[*i*]. The number of \"cows\" is a number of such digits *c* that *s* contains *c* in the position *i* (i.e. *s*[*i*]<==<=*c*), *x* contains *c*, but *x*[*i*]<=\u2260<=*c*.\n\nFor example, the secret string is \"0427\", the opponent's try is \"0724\", then the answer is 2 bulls and 2 cows (the bulls are \"0\" and \"2\", the cows are \"4\" and \"7\"). If the secret string is \"0123\", the opponent's try is \"0330\", then the answer is 1 bull and 1 cow.\n\nIn this problem you are to guess the string *s* that the system has chosen. You only know that the chosen string consists of 4 distinct digits.\n\nYou can make queries to the testing system, each query is the output of a single 4-digit string. The answer to the query is the number of bulls and number of cows. If the system's response equals \"4 0\", that means the interaction with your problem is over and the program must terminate. That is possible for two reasons \u2014 the program either guessed the number *x* or made an invalid action (for example, printed letters instead of digits).\n\nYour program is allowed to do at most 7 queries.\n\nYou can hack solutions of other participants providing a 4-digit string containing distinct digits \u2014 the secret string.\nInput specification: To read answers to the queries, the program must use the standard input.\n\nThe program will receive pairs of non-negative integers in the input, one pair per line. The first number in a pair is a number of bulls and the second one is a number of cows of the string *s* and the string *x**i* printed by your program. If the system response equals \"4 0\", then your solution should terminate.\n\nThe testing system will let your program read the *i*-th pair of integers from the input only after your program displays the corresponding system query in the output: prints value *x**i* in a single line and executes operation flush.. Output specification: The program must use the standard output to print queries.\n\nYour program must output requests \u2014 4-digit strings *x*1,<=*x*2,<=..., one per line. After the output of each line the program must execute flush operation. The program should read the answer to the query from the standard input.\n\nYour program is allowed to do at most 7 queries.\nDemo input: ['0 1\\n2 0\\n1 1\\n0 4\\n2 1\\n4 0\\n'], Demo output: ['8000\\n0179\\n3159\\n3210\\n0112\\n0123']\nNote: The secret string *s* in the example is \"0123\"."}]}}

The elements of the array are enumerated from $1$ to $n$. You perform $q$ operations on the array. The $i$-th operation is described with three integers $l_i$, $r_i$ and $x_i$ ($1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$, $1 \\leq x_i \\leq n$) and means that you should add $x_i$ to each of the elements with indices $l_i, l_i + 1, \\ldots, r_i$. After all operations you should find the maximum in the array.\n\nGrisha is clever, so he solved the problem quickly.\n\nHowever something went wrong inside his head and now he thinks of the following question: \"consider we applied some subset of the operations to the array. What are the possible values of the maximum in the array?\"\n\nHelp Grisha, find all integers $y$ between $1$ and $n$ such that if you apply some subset (possibly empty) of the operations, then the maximum in the array becomes equal to $y$.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \\leq n, q \\leq 10^{4}$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array and the number of queries in the initial problem.\n\nThe following $q$ lines contain queries, one per line. The $i$-th of these lines contains three integers $l_i$, $r_i$ and $x_i$ ($1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$, $1 \\leq x_i \\leq n$), denoting a query of adding $x_i$ to the segment from $l_i$-th to $r_i$-th elements of the array, inclusive.. Output specification: In the first line print the only integer $k$, denoting the number of integers from $1$ to $n$, inclusive, that can be equal to the maximum in the array after applying some subset (possibly empty) of the given operations.\n\nIn the next line print these $k$ integers from $1$ to $n$\u00a0\u2014 the possible values of the maximum.

If you take the first two queries, the maximum becomes $3$. If you take only the fourth query, the maximum becomes $4$. If you take the fourth query and something more, the maximum becomes greater that $n$, so you shouldn't print it.\n\nIn the second example you can take the first query to obtain $1$. You can take only the second query to obtain $2$. You can take all queries to obtain $3$.\n\nIn the third example you can obtain the following maximums:\n -  You can achieve the maximim of $2$ by using queries: $(1)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $3$ by using queries: $(2)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $5$ by using queries: $(1, 2)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $6$ by using queries: $(3)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $8$ by using queries: $(1, 3)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $9$ by using queries: $(2, 3)$."}]}}

Fortunately, the robot recorded its own movements correctly. Now Draude wants to find out when his robot functions wrong. Heh, if Draude only remembered the map of the field, where he tested the robot, he would easily say if the robot walked in the right direction or not. But the field map was lost never to be found, that's why he asks you to find out if there exist at least one map, where the path recorded by the robot is the shortest.\n\nThe map is an infinite checkered field, where each square is either empty, or contains an obstruction.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Let's define the permutation of length *n* as an array *p*<==<=[*p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n*] consisting of *n* distinct integers from range from 1 to *n*. We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value *p*1, value 2 into the value *p*2 and so on.\n\nKyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a permutation. A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle). The cyclic representation is a representation of *p* as a collection of cycles forming *p*. For example, permutation *p*<==<=[4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] has a cyclic representation that looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are swapped, and 5 remains in place. \n\nPermutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya defines the standard cyclic representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first. Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation of [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] is (421)(5)(63).\n\nNow, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For instance, [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] will become [4,<=2,<=1,<=5,<=6,<=3].\n\nKyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of length *n* that do not change in a list in lexicographic order. Unfortunately, his friend Tamaki Suoh lost this list. Kyoya wishes to reproduce the list and he needs your help. Given the integers *n* and *k*, print the permutation that was *k*-th on Kyoya's list.\nInput specification: The first line will contain two integers *n*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*min*{1018,<=*l*} where *l* is the length of the Kyoya's list).. Output specification: Print *n* space-separated integers, representing the permutation that is the answer for the question.\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n', '10 1\\n'], Demo output: ['1 3 2 4\\n', '1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\\n']\nNote: The standard cycle representation is (1)(32)(4), which after removing parenthesis gives us the original permutation. The first permutation on the list would be [1,\u20092,\u20093,\u20094], while the second permutation would be [1,\u20092,\u20094,\u20093]."}]}}

If we split string *a* into two halves of the same size *a*1 and *a*2, and string *b* into two halves of the same size *b*1 and *b*2, then one of the following is correct:   *a*1 is equivalent to *b*1, and *a*2 is equivalent to *b*2 1.  *a*1 is equivalent to *b*2, and *a*2 is equivalent to *b*1 \nAs a home task, the teacher gave two strings to his students and asked to determine if they are equivalent.\n\nGerald has already completed this home task. Now it's your turn!\nInput specification: The first two lines of the input contain two strings given by the teacher. Each of them has the length from 1 to 200<=000 and consists of lowercase English letters. The strings have the same length.. Output specification: Print \"YES\" (without the quotes), if these two strings are equivalent, and \"NO\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\nDemo input: ['aaba\\nabaa\\n', 'aabb\\nabab\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: In the first sample you should split the first string into strings \"aa\" and \"ba\", the second one \u2014 into strings \"ab\" and \"aa\". \"aa\" is equivalent to \"aa\"; \"ab\" is equivalent to \"ba\" as \"ab\" = \"a\" + \"b\", \"ba\" = \"b\" + \"a\".\n\nIn the second sample the first string can be splitted into strings \"aa\" and \"bb\", that are equivalent only to themselves. That's why string \"aabb\" is equivalent only to itself and to string \"bbaa\"."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes. The second line contains integers *x**c* and *y**c* \u2014 the initial square's coordinates (1<=\u2264<=*x**c*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y**c*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nThe third line contains an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the number of vectors. Then follow *k* lines, each of them contains two integers *dx**i* and *dy**i* (|*dx**i*|,<=|*dy**i*|<=\u2264<=109,<=|*dx*|<=+<=|*dy*|<=\u2265<=1).. Output specification: Print the single number \u2014 the number of steps Vasya had made.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.\nDemo input: ['4 5\\n1 1\\n3\\n1 1\\n1 1\\n0 -2\\n', '10 10\\n1 2\\n1\\n-1 0\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: In the first sample Vasya is initially positioned at square (1,\u20091) and makes 3 steps by the first vector (1,\u20091). So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091). He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

However, Vasilisa the Wise does not know what the box's secret is, since she cannot open it again. She hopes that you will help her one more time with that.\n\nThe box's lock looks as follows: it contains 4 identical deepenings for gems as a 2<=\u00d7<=2 square, and some integer numbers are written at the lock's edge near the deepenings. The example of a lock is given on the picture below.\n\nThe box is accompanied with 9 gems. Their shapes match the deepenings' shapes and each gem contains one number from 1 to 9 (each number is written on exactly one gem). The box will only open after it is decorated with gems correctly: that is, each deepening in the lock should be filled with exactly one gem. Also, the sums of numbers in the square's rows, columns and two diagonals of the square should match the numbers written at the lock's edge. For example, the above lock will open if we fill the deepenings with gems with numbers as is shown on the picture below.\n\nNow Vasilisa the Wise wants to define, given the numbers on the box's lock, which gems she should put in the deepenings to open the box. Help Vasilisa to solve this challenging task.\nInput specification: The input contains numbers written on the edges of the lock of the box. The first line contains space-separated integers *r*1 and *r*2 that define the required sums of numbers in the rows of the square.

Write a python script for the following problem: In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.\n\nThere are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.\n\nOfficer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:\n -  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$; -  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. \nFor example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\n\nThe structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.\n\nFormally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.\n\nBerland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.\n\nSuppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ \u2014 one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.\n\nLet's look at the following example:\n\nIf officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.\n\nIf officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.\n\nTo answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.\n\nYou should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i &lt; i$), where $p_i$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $i$. The commander has index $1$ and doesn't have any superiors.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query is given as a pair ($u_i, k_i$) ($1 \\le u_i, k_i \\le n$), where $u_i$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $k_i$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence.. Output specification: Print $q$ numbers, where the $i$-th number is the officer at the position $k_i$ in the list which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if it starts spreading from officer $u_i$. Print \"-1\" if the number of officers which receive the command is less than $k_i$.\n\nYou should process queries independently. They do not affect each other.\nDemo input: ['9 6\\n1 1 1 3 5 3 5 7\\n3 1\\n1 5\\n3 4\\n7 3\\n1 8\\n1 9\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n6\\n8\\n-1\\n9\\n4\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective.

This rule is applied multiple times, until there are no more sets of 3 or more contiguous balls of the same color. \n\nFor example, if Iahub has the row of balls [black, black, white, white, black, black] and a white ball, he can insert the ball between two white balls. Thus three white balls are destroyed, and then four black balls become contiguous, so all four balls are destroyed. The row will not contain any ball in the end, so Iahub can destroy all 6 balls.\n\nIahub wants to destroy as many balls as possible. You are given the description of the row of balls, and the color of Iahub's ball. Help Iahub train for the IOI by telling him the maximum number of balls from the row he can destroy.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains three integers: *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=100) and *x* (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*k*). The next line contains *n* space-separated integers *c*1,<=*c*2,<=...,<=*c**n* (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=*k*). Number *c**i* means that the *i*-th ball in the row has color *c**i*.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the initial row of balls will never contain three or more contiguous balls of the same color.. Output specification: Print a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of balls Iahub can destroy.\nDemo input: ['6 2 2\\n1 1 2 2 1 1\\n', '1 1 1\\n1\\n'], Demo output: ['6\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

But it turns out to be pretty hard for her, because she is too young. Therefore, her brother Sergey always helps her.\n\nSergey gives Nastya the word *t* and wants to get the word *p* out of it.

Write a python script for the following problem: Manao works on a sports TV. He's spent much time watching the football games of some country. After a while he began to notice different patterns. For example, each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform and guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well. For each team the color of the home and guest uniform is different.\n\nThere are *n* teams taking part in the national championship. The championship consists of *n*\u00b7(*n*<=-<=1) games: each team invites each other team to its stadium. At this point Manao wondered: how many times during the championship is a host team going to put on the guest uniform? Note that the order of the games does not affect this number.\n\nYou know the colors of the home and guest uniform for each team.

He is allowed to delete any number of characters, even the whole string except for the symbol '#'. Vasya wants to pick such a way to delete suffixes that the total number of deleted symbols is minimum possible. If there are several optimal solutions, he is fine with any of them.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=500<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of hashtags being edited now.\n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains exactly one hashtag of positive length.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of all hashtags (i.e. the total length of the string except for characters '#') won't exceed 500<=000..

That's why in the third sample we can't keep first two hashtags unchanged and shorten the other two."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Further research on zombie thought processes yielded interesting results. As we know from the previous problem, the nervous system of a zombie consists of *n* brains and *m* brain connectors joining some pairs of brains together. It was observed that the intellectual abilities of a zombie depend mainly on the topology of its nervous system. More precisely, we define the distance between two brains *u* and *v* (1<=\u2264<=*u*,<=*v*<=\u2264<=*n*) as the minimum number of brain connectors used when transmitting a thought between these two brains. The brain latency of a zombie is defined to be the maximum distance between any two of its brains. Researchers conjecture that the brain latency is the crucial parameter which determines how smart a given zombie is. Help them test this conjecture by writing a program to compute brain latencies of nervous systems.\n\nIn this problem you may assume that any nervous system given in the input is valid, i.e., it satisfies conditions (1) and (2) from the easy version.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100000) denoting the number of brains (which are conveniently numbered from 1 to *n*) and the number of brain connectors in the nervous system, respectively.

ZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon recognizes only *m* different colors, so 0<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=*m*, where *c**i*<==<=0 means that tree *i* is uncolored.\n\nZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon decides to color only the uncolored trees, i.e. the trees with *c**i*<==<=0. They can color each of them them in any of the *m* colors from 1 to *m*. Coloring the *i*-th tree with color *j* requires exactly *p**i*,<=*j* litres of paint.\n\nThe two friends define the beauty of a coloring of the trees as the minimum number of contiguous groups (each group contains some subsegment of trees) you can split all the *n* trees into so that each group contains trees of the same color. For example, if the colors of the trees from left to right are 2,<=1,<=1,<=1,<=3,<=2,<=2,<=3,<=1,<=3, the beauty of the coloring is 7, since we can partition the trees into 7 contiguous groups of the same color : {2},<={1,<=1,<=1},<={3},<={2,<=2},<={3},<={1},<={3}. \n\nZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon wants to color all uncolored trees so that the beauty of the coloring is exactly *k*. They need your help to determine the minimum amount of paint (in litres) needed to finish the job.\n\nPlease note that the friends can't color the trees that are already colored.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers, *n*, *m* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of trees, number of colors and beauty of the resulting coloring respectively.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *c*1,<=*c*2,<=...,<=*c**n* (0<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=*m*), the initial colors of the trees. *c**i* equals to 0 if the tree number *i* is uncolored, otherwise the *i*-th tree has color *c**i*.\n\nThen *n* lines follow. Each of them contains *m* integers. The *j*-th number on the *i*-th of them line denotes *p**i*,<=*j* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 the amount of litres the friends need to color *i*-th tree with color *j*. *p**i*,<=*j*'s are specified even for the initially colored trees, but such trees still can't be colored.. Output specification: Print a single integer, the minimum amount of paint needed to color the trees. If there are no valid tree colorings of beauty *k*, print <=-<=1.\nDemo input: ['3 2 2\\n0 0 0\\n1 2\\n3 4\\n5 6\\n', '3 2 2\\n2 1 2\\n1 3\\n2 4\\n3 5\\n', '3 2 2\\n2 0 0\\n1 3\\n2 4\\n3 5\\n', '3 2 3\\n2 1 2\\n1 3\\n2 4\\n3 5\\n'], Demo output: ['10', '-1', '5', '0']\nNote: In the first sample case, coloring the trees with colors 2,\u20091,\u20091 minimizes the amount of paint used, which equals to 2\u2009+\u20093\u2009+\u20095\u2009=\u200910. Note that 1,\u20091,\u20091 would not be valid because the beauty of such coloring equals to 1 ({1,\u20091,\u20091} is a way to group the trees into a single group of the same color).\n\nIn the second sample case, all the trees are colored, but the beauty of the coloring is 3, so there is no valid coloring, and the answer is \u2009-\u20091.\n\nIn the last sample case, all the trees are colored and the beauty of the coloring matches *k*, so no paint is used and the answer is 0."}]}}

There are dozens of thousands of books in the library.\n\nSome long and uninteresting story was removed...\n\nThe alphabet of Bookland is so large that its letters are denoted by positive integers. Each letter can be small or large, the large version of a letter *x* is denoted by *x*'. BSCII encoding, which is used everywhere in Bookland, is made in that way so that large letters are presented in the order of the numbers they are denoted by, and small letters are presented in the order of the numbers they are denoted by, but all large letters are before all small letters. For example, the following conditions hold: 2<=&lt;<=3, 2'<=&lt;<=3', 3'<=&lt;<=2.\n\nA word *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**a* is not lexicographically greater than *y*1,<=*y*2,<=...,<=*y**b* if one of the two following conditions holds: \n -  *a*<=\u2264<=*b* and *x*1<==<=*y*1,<=...,<=*x**a*<==<=*y**a*, i.e. the first word is the prefix of the second word; -  there is a position 1<=\u2264<=*j*<=\u2264<=*min*(*a*,<=*b*), such that *x*1<==<=*y*1,<=...,<=*x**j*<=-<=1<==<=*y**j*<=-<=1 and *x**j*<=&lt;<=*y**j*, i.e. at the first position where the words differ the first word has a smaller letter than the second word has. \nFor example, the word \"3' 7 5\" is before the word \"2 4' 6\" in lexicographical order. It is said that sequence of words is in lexicographical order if each word is not lexicographically greater than the next word in the sequence.\n\nDenis has a sequence of words consisting of small letters only. He wants to change some letters to large (let's call this process a capitalization) in such a way that the sequence of words is in lexicographical order. However, he soon realized that for some reason he can't change a single letter in a single word. He only can choose a letter and change all of its occurrences in all words to large letters. He can perform this operation any number of times with arbitrary letters of Bookland's alphabet.\n\nHelp Denis to choose which letters he needs to capitalize (make large) in order to make the sequence of words lexicographically ordered, or determine that it is impossible.\n\nNote that some words can be equal.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of words and the number of letters in Bookland's alphabet, respectively.

Output specification: In the first line print \"Yes\" (without quotes), if it is possible to capitalize some set of letters in such a way that the sequence of words becomes lexicographically ordered. Otherwise, print \"No\" (without quotes).\n\nIf the required is possible, in the second line print *k*\u00a0\u2014 the number of letters Denis has to capitalize (make large), and in the third line print *k* distinct integers\u00a0\u2014 these letters. Note that you don't need to minimize the value *k*.\n\nYou can print the letters in any order.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes. The second line contains integers *x**c* and *y**c* \u2014 the initial square's coordinates (1<=\u2264<=*x**c*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y**c*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nThe third line contains an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the number of vectors. Then follow *k* lines, each of them contains two integers *dx**i* and *dy**i* (|*dx**i*|,<=|*dy**i*|<=\u2264<=109,<=|*dx*|<=+<=|*dy*|<=\u2265<=1).. Output specification: Print the single number \u2014 the number of steps Vasya had made.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++.

So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091). He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

Besides, the keys are of two types.

However, he can only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the keys does not exceed *x*. The keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.\n\nVasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest \"Shift\" key is strictly larger than *x*.

He arranged his army on a segment *n* in length not far from the city walls. And only the frost magician Solomon can save the Frost Kingdom.\n\nThe *n*-long segment is located at a distance equal exactly to 1 from the castle walls. It can be imaginarily divided into unit segments. On some of the unit segments fire demons are located \u2014 no more than one demon per position. Each demon is characterised by his strength - by some positive integer. We can regard the fire demons being idle.\n\nInitially Solomon is positioned on the fortress wall. He can perform the following actions several times in a row: \n-  \"L\" \u2014 Solomon shifts one unit to the left. This movement cannot be performed on the castle wall.-  \"R\" \u2014 Solomon shifts one unit to the left. This movement cannot be performed if there's no ice block to the right.-  \"A\" \u2014 If there's nothing to the right of Solomon, then Solomon creates an ice block that immediately freezes to the block that Solomon is currently standing on.

Write a python script for the following problem: One foggy Stockholm morning, Karlsson decided to snack on some jam in his friend Lillebror Svantenson's house. Fortunately for Karlsson, there wasn't anybody in his friend's house. Karlsson was not going to be hungry any longer, so he decided to get some food in the house.\n\nKarlsson's gaze immediately fell on *n* wooden cupboards, standing in the kitchen. He immediately realized that these cupboards have hidden jam stocks. Karlsson began to fly greedily around the kitchen, opening and closing the cupboards' doors, grab and empty all the jars of jam that he could find.\n\nAnd now all jars of jam are empty, Karlsson has had enough and does not want to leave traces of his stay, so as not to let down his friend. Each of the cupboards has two doors: the left one and the right one. Karlsson remembers that when he rushed to the kitchen, all the cupboards' left doors were in the same position (open or closed), similarly, all the cupboards' right doors were in the same position (open or closed). Karlsson wants the doors to meet this condition as well by the time the family returns. Karlsson does not remember the position of all the left doors, also, he cannot remember the position of all the right doors. Therefore, it does not matter to him in what position will be all left or right doors. It is important to leave all the left doors in the same position, and all the right doors in the same position. For example, all the left doors may be closed, and all the right ones may be open.\n\nKarlsson needs one second to open or close a door of a cupboard. He understands that he has very little time before the family returns, so he wants to know the minimum number of seconds *t*, in which he is able to bring all the cupboard doors in the required position.\n\nYour task is to write a program that will determine the required number of seconds *t*.\nInput specification: The first input line contains a single integer *n* \u2014 the number of cupboards in the kitchen (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=104). Then follow *n* lines, each containing two integers *l**i* and *r**i* (0<=\u2264<=*l**i*,<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=1). Number *l**i* equals one, if the left door of the *i*-th cupboard is opened, otherwise number *l**i* equals zero. Similarly, number *r**i* equals one, if the right door of the *i*-th cupboard is opened, otherwise number *r**i* equals zero.\n\nThe numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces..

Let's define neighbors for some fixed point from the given set (*x*,<=*y*): \n -  point (*x*',<=*y*') is (*x*,<=*y*)'s right neighbor, if *x*'<=&gt;<=*x* and *y*'<==<=*y* -  point (*x*',<=*y*') is (*x*,<=*y*)'s left neighbor, if *x*'<=&lt;<=*x* and *y*'<==<=*y* -  point (*x*',<=*y*') is (*x*,<=*y*)'s lower neighbor, if *x*'<==<=*x* and *y*'<=&lt;<=*y* -  point (*x*',<=*y*') is (*x*,<=*y*)'s upper neighbor, if *x*'<==<=*x* and *y*'<=&gt;<=*y* \nWe'll consider point (*x*,<=*y*) from the given set supercentral, if it has at least one upper, at least one lower, at least one left and at least one right neighbor among this set's points.\n\nVasya marked quite many points on the paper. Analyzing the picture manually is rather a challenge, so Vasya asked you to help him. Your task is to find the number of supercentral points in the given set.\nInput specification: The first input line contains the only integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200) \u2014 the number of points in the given set.

The problem does not state all the game's rules explicitly \u2014 you can find them later yourselves if you want.\n\nTo play durak you need a pack of 36 cards. Each card has a suit (\"S\", \"H\", \"D\" and \"C\") and a rank (in the increasing order \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"T\", \"J\", \"Q\", \"K\" and \"A\"). At the beginning of the game one suit is arbitrarily chosen as trump. \n\nThe players move like that: one player puts one or several of his cards on the table and the other one should beat each of them with his cards.\n\nA card beats another one if both cards have similar suits and the first card has a higher rank then the second one. Besides, a trump card can beat any non-trump card whatever the cards\u2019 ranks are. In all other cases you can not beat the second card with the first one.\n\nYou are given the trump suit and two different cards. Determine whether the first one beats the second one or not.\nInput specification: The first line contains the tramp suit. It is \"S\", \"H\", \"D\" or \"C\".\n\nThe second line contains the description of the two different cards. Each card is described by one word consisting of two symbols. The first symbol stands for the rank (\"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"T\", \"J\", \"Q\", \"K\" and \"A\"), and the second one stands for the suit (\"S\", \"H\", \"D\" and \"C\")..

Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of *n* rows and *m* columns. Cell (*x*,<=*y*) is the cell in the *x*-th row in the *y*-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.\n\nMoreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1,<=1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (*n*,<=1) \u2014 the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion \u2014 all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. *n* and *m* given are such that she always end up in cell (1,<=2).\n\nLara has already moved to a neighbouring cell *k* times. Can you determine her current position?\nInput specification: The only line contains three integers *n*, *m* and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109, *n* is always even, 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=&lt;<=*n*\u00b7*m*). Note that *k* doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!.

Output specification: Output minimal number of steps required to make exactly *n*<=/<=2 piles contain number of candies that is a square of some integer and exactly *n*<=/<=2 piles contain number of candies that is not a square of any integer.

During each move you should add one candy to second pile. After it size of second pile becomes 16. After that Borya and Ann will have two piles with number of candies which is a square of integer (second and fourth pile) and two piles with number of candies which is not a square of any integer (first and third pile).\n\nIn second example you should add two candies to any three piles."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Since Sonya is interested in robotics too, she decided to construct robots that will read and recognize numbers.\n\nSonya has drawn $n$ numbers in a row, $a_i$ is located in the $i$-th position. She also has put a robot at each end of the row (to the left of the first number and to the right of the last number). Sonya will give a number to each robot (they can be either same or different) and run them. When a robot is running, it is moving toward to another robot, reading numbers in the row. When a robot is reading a number that is equal to the number that was given to that robot, it will turn off and stay in the same position.\n\nSonya does not want robots to break, so she will give such numbers that robots will stop before they meet. That is, the girl wants them to stop at different positions so that the first robot is to the left of the second one.\n\nFor example, if the numbers $[1, 5, 4, 1, 3]$ are written, and Sonya gives the number $1$ to the first robot and the number $4$ to the second one, the first robot will stop in the $1$-st position while the second one in the $3$-rd position. In that case, robots will not meet each other. As a result, robots will not be broken. But if Sonya gives the number $4$ to the first robot and the number $5$ to the second one, they will meet since the first robot will stop in the $3$-rd position while the second one is in the $2$-nd position.\n\nSonya understands that it does not make sense to give a number that is not written in the row because a robot will not find this number and will meet the other robot.\n\nSonya is now interested in finding the number of different pairs that she can give to robots so that they will not meet. In other words, she wants to know the number of pairs ($p$, $q$), where she will give $p$ to the first robot and $q$ to the second one. Pairs ($p_i$, $q_i$) and ($p_j$, $q_j$) are different if $p_i\\neq p_j$ or $q_i\\neq q_j$.\n\nUnfortunately, Sonya is busy fixing robots that broke after a failed launch. That is why she is asking you to find the number of pairs that she can give to robots so that they will not meet.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1\\leq n\\leq 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of numbers in a row.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1\\leq a_i\\leq 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the numbers in a row..

Write a python script for the following problem: Haiku is a genre of Japanese traditional poetry.\n\nA haiku poem consists of 17 syllables split into three phrases, containing 5, 7 and 5 syllables correspondingly (the first phrase should contain exactly 5 syllables, the second phrase should contain exactly 7 syllables, and the third phrase should contain exactly 5 syllables). A haiku masterpiece contains a description of a moment in those three phrases. Every word is important in a small poem, which is why haiku are rich with symbols. Each word has a special meaning, a special role. The main principle of haiku is to say much using a few words.\n\nTo simplify the matter, in the given problem we will consider that the number of syllable in the phrase is equal to the number of vowel letters there. Only the following letters are regarded as vowel letters: \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\" and \"u\".\n\nThree phases from a certain poem are given. Determine whether it is haiku or not.\nInput specification: The input data consists of three lines. The length of each line is between 1 and 100, inclusive.

A word is a non-empty sequence of lowercase Latin letters. Leading and/or trailing spaces in phrases are allowed. Every phrase has at least one non-space character. See the example for clarification.. Output specification: Print \"YES\" (without the quotes) if the poem is a haiku.

Output specification: A single integer \u2014 the number of distinct leaves of a tree the path to which from Kefa's home contains at most *m* consecutive vertices with cats.\nDemo input: ['4 1\\n1 1 0 0\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n1 4\\n', '7 1\\n1 0 1 1 0 0 0\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n2 4\\n2 5\\n3 6\\n3 7\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: Let us remind you that a tree is a connected graph on *n* vertices and *n*\u2009-\u20091 edge. A rooted tree is a tree with a special vertex called root. In a rooted tree among any two vertices connected by an edge, one vertex is a parent (the one closer to the root), and the other one is a child. A vertex is called a leaf, if it has no children.\n\nNote to the first sample test: <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/785114b4b3f5336f02078c25750f87c5a1d0b4be.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> The vertices containing cats are marked red.

To add element $a_i$ one needs to traverse the tree starting from the root and using the following rules:   The pointer to the current node is set to the root. 1.  If $a_i$ is greater than the value in the current node, then its right child becomes the current node. Otherwise, the left child of the current node becomes the new current node. 1.

One of its many weird features is the method of character-based output, known as Turing Tape method. It converts an array of unsigned 8-bit integers into a sequence of characters to print, using the following method.\n\nThe integers of the array are processed one by one, starting from the first. Processing *i*-th element of the array is done in three steps:\n\n1. The 8-bit binary notation of the ASCII-code of the previous printed character is reversed. When the first element of the array is processed, the result of this step is considered to be 0.\n\n2. The *i*-th element of the array is subtracted from the result of the previous step modulo 256.\n\n3. The binary notation of the result of the previous step is reversed again to produce ASCII-code of the *i*-th character to be printed.\n\nYou are given the text printed using this method. Restore the array used to produce this text.\nInput specification: The input will consist of a single line *text* which contains the message printed using the described method. String *text* will contain between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive. ASCII-code of each character of *text* will be between 32 (space) and 126 (tilde), inclusive..

More precisely, *x**i* means that the *i*-th sock Andryusha took out was from pair *x**i*.\n\nIt is guaranteed that Andryusha took exactly two socks of each pair..

Then he took the next sock which is from the first pair as well, so he immediately puts both socks to the wardrobe. Thus, at most one sock was on the table at the same time.\n\nIn the second example Andryusha behaved as follows: \n -  Initially the table was empty, he took out a sock from pair 2 and put it on the table. -  Sock (2) was on the table. Andryusha took out a sock from pair 1 and put it on the table. -  Socks (1,\u20092) were on the table. Andryusha took out a sock from pair 1, and put this pair into the wardrobe. -  Sock (2) was on the table. Andryusha took out a sock from pair 3 and put it on the table. -  Socks (2,\u20093) were on the table. Andryusha took out a sock from pair 2, and put this pair into the wardrobe. -  Sock (3) was on the table. Andryusha took out a sock from pair 3 and put this pair into the wardrobe."}]}}

The Donkey imagined two rays emanating from he origin of axes at angles \u03b11 and \u03b12 to the *OX* axis.\n\nNow he chooses any star that lies strictly between these rays.

Progressions in Uzhlyandia are unusual: both *b*1 and *q* can equal 0. Also, Dvastan gave Masha *m* \"bad\" integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**m*, and an integer *l*.\n\nMasha writes all progression terms one by one onto the board (including repetitive) while condition |*b**i*|<=\u2264<=*l* is satisfied (|*x*| means absolute value of *x*).

By the given coordinates of the triangle you should find out if it is right-angled, almost right-angled, or neither of these.\nInput specification: The first input line contains 6 space-separated integers *x*1,<=*y*1,<=*x*2,<=*y*2,<=*x*3,<=*y*3 \u2014 coordinates of the triangle's vertices. All the coordinates are integer and don't exceed 100 in absolute value. It's guaranteed that the triangle is nondegenerate, i.e. its total area is not zero.. Output specification: If the given triangle is right-angled, output RIGHT, if it is almost right-angled, output ALMOST, and if it is neither of these, output NEITHER.\nDemo input: ['0 0 2 0 0 1\\n', '2 3 4 5 6 6\\n', '-1 0 2 0 0 1\\n'], Demo output: ['RIGHT\\n', 'NEITHER\\n', 'ALMOST\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Vasya has *n* days of vacations! So he decided to improve his IT skills and do sport. Vasya knows the following information about each of this *n* days: whether that gym opened and whether a contest was carried out in the Internet on that day. For the *i*-th day there are four options:\n 1.  on this day the gym is closed and the contest is not carried out; 1.  on this day the gym is closed and the contest is carried out; 1.  on this day the gym is open and the contest is not carried out; 1.  on this day the gym is open and the contest is carried out. \nOn each of days Vasya can either have a rest or write the contest (if it is carried out on this day), or do sport (if the gym is open on this day).\n\nFind the minimum number of days on which Vasya will have a rest (it means, he will not do sport and write the contest at the same time). The only limitation that Vasya has \u2014 he does not want to do the same activity on two consecutive days: it means, he will not do sport on two consecutive days, and write the contest on two consecutive days.\nInput specification: The first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of days of Vasya's vacations.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence of integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=3) separated by space, where: \n -  *a**i* equals 0, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is closed and the contest is not carried out; -  *a**i* equals 1, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is closed, but the contest is carried out; -  *a**i* equals 2, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is open and the contest is not carried out; -  *a**i* equals 3, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is open and the contest is carried out.. Output specification: Print the minimum possible number of days on which Vasya will have a rest. Remember that Vasya refuses:\n -  to do sport on any two consecutive days, -  to write the contest on any two consecutive days.\nDemo input: ['4\\n1 3 2 0\\n', '7\\n1 3 3 2 1 2 3\\n', '2\\n2 2\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '0\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: In the first test Vasya can write the contest on the day number 1 and do sport on the day number 3. Thus, he will have a rest for only 2 days.\n\nIn the second test Vasya should write contests on days number 1, 3, 5 and 7, in other days do sport. Thus, he will not have a rest for a single day.\n\nIn the third test Vasya can do sport either on a day number 1 or number 2. He can not do sport in two days, because it will be contrary to the his limitation. Thus, he will have a rest for only one day."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Berland has a long and glorious history. To increase awareness about it among younger citizens, King of Berland decided to compose an anthem.\n\nThough there are lots and lots of victories in history of Berland, there is the one that stand out the most. King wants to mention it in the anthem as many times as possible.\n\nHe has already composed major part of the anthem and now just needs to fill in some letters. King asked you to help him with this work.\n\nThe anthem is the string *s* of no more than 105 small Latin letters and question marks. The most glorious victory is the string *t* of no more than 105 small Latin letters. You should replace all the question marks with small Latin letters in such a way that the number of occurrences of string *t* in string *s* is maximal.\n\nNote that the occurrences of string *t* in *s* can overlap. Check the third example for clarification.\nInput specification: The first line contains string of small Latin letters and question marks *s* (1<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=105).\n\nThe second line contains string of small Latin letters *t* (1<=\u2264<=|*t*|<=\u2264<=105).\n\nProduct of lengths of strings |*s*|\u00b7|*t*| won't exceed 107..
