Complete the given code for the following problem: Kevin Sun has just finished competing in Codeforces Round #334! The round was 120 minutes long and featured five problems with maximum point values of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500, respectively. Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.\n\nCodeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is *x*, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute *m* but made *w* wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is . His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.\n\nAll arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains five space-separated integers *m*1, *m*2, *m*3, *m*4, *m*5, where *m**i* (0<=\u2264<=*m**i*<=\u2264<=119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem *i*. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted.\n\nThe second line contains five space-separated integers *w*1, *w*2, *w*3, *w*4, *w*5, where *w**i* (0<=\u2264<=*w**i*<=\u2264<=10) is Kevin's number of wrong submissions on problem *i*.\n\nThe last line contains two space-separated integers *h**s* and *h**u* (0<=\u2264<=*h**s*,<=*h**u*<=\u2264<=20), denoting the Kevin's numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively.. Output specification: Print a single integer, the value of Kevin's final score.\nNote: In the second sample, Kevin takes 119 minutes on all of the problems. Therefore, he gets <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/42158dc2bc78cd21fa679530ae9ef8b9ea298d15.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> of the points on each problem. So his score from solving problems is <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/fdf392d8508500b57f8057ac0c4c892ab5f925a2.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>. Adding in 10\u00b7100\u2009=\u20091000 points from hacks, his total score becomes 3930\u2009+\u20091000\u2009=\u20094930.Complete the following code: ```python\ndef score(x,m,w):\r\n    t=(1-(m/250))*x - (50*w)\r\n    return max(0.3*x,t)\r\n\r\n```"}]}}

At first night he received embosser and was to take stock of the whole exposition.\n\nEmbosser is a special devise that allows to \"print\" the text of a plastic tape. Text is printed sequentially, character by character. The device consists of a wheel with a lowercase English letters written in a circle, static pointer to the current letter and a button that print the chosen letter. At one move it's allowed to rotate the alphabetic wheel one step clockwise or counterclockwise. Initially, static pointer points to letter 'a'. Other letters are located as shown on the picture:\n\nAfter Grigoriy add new item to the base he has to print its name on the plastic tape and attach it to the corresponding exhibit. It's not required to return the wheel to its initial position with pointer on the letter 'a'.\n\nOur hero is afraid that some exhibits may become alive and start to attack him, so he wants to print the names as fast as possible.

A player loses when he cannot take the required number of stones (i. e. the heap has strictly less stones left than one needs to take). \n\nYour task is to determine by the given *a*, *b* and *n* who wins the game.\nInput specification: The only string contains space-separated integers *a*, *b* and *n* (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*,<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the fixed numbers Simon and Antisimon have received correspondingly and the initial number of stones in the pile.. Output specification: If Simon wins, print \"0\" (without the quotes), otherwise print \"1\" (without the quotes).\nNote: The greatest common divisor of two non-negative integers *a* and *b* is such maximum positive integer *k*, that *a* is divisible by *k* without remainder and similarly, *b* is divisible by *k* without remainder. Let *gcd*(*a*,\u2009*b*) represent the operation of calculating the greatest common divisor of numbers *a* and *b*. Specifically, *gcd*(*x*,\u20090)\u2009=\u2009*gcd*(0,\u2009*x*)\u2009=\u2009*x*.\n\nIn the first sample the game will go like that:\n-  Simon should take *gcd*(3,\u20099)\u2009=\u20093 stones from the heap. After his move the heap has 6 stones left.-  Antisimon should take *gcd*(5,\u20096)\u2009=\u20091 stone from the heap. After his move the heap has 5 stones left.-  Simon should take *gcd*(3,\u20095)\u2009=\u20091 stone from the heap. After his move the heap has 4 stones left.-  Antisimon should take *gcd*(5,\u20094)\u2009=\u20091 stone from the heap. After his move the heap has 3 stones left.-  Simon should take *gcd*(3,\u20093)\u2009=\u20093 stones from the heap. After his move the heap has 0 stones left.-  Antisimon should take *gcd*(5,\u20090)\u2009=\u20095 stones from the heap. As 0\u2009&lt;\u20095, it is impossible and Antisimon loses.\nIn the second sample each player during each move takes one stone from the heap. As *n* is even, Antisimon takes the last stone and Simon can't make a move after that.Complete the following code: ```python\ns=[int(x) for x in input().split()]\r\nm=n\r\na=s[0]\r\nb=s[1]\r\nn=s[2]\r\ndef f(x,y):\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: Petya has recently learned data structure named \"Binary heap\".\n\nThe heap he is now operating with allows the following operations: \n -  put the given number into the heap; -  get the value of the minimum element in the heap; -  extract the minimum element from the heap; \nThus, at any moment of time the heap contains several integers (possibly none), some of them might be equal.\n\nIn order to better learn this data structure Petya took an empty heap and applied some operations above to it. Also, he carefully wrote down all the operations and their results to his event log, following the format: \n -  insert *x*\u00a0\u2014 put the element with value *x* in the heap; -  getMin *x*\u00a0\u2014 the value of the minimum element contained in the heap was equal to *x*; -  removeMin\u00a0\u2014 the minimum element was extracted from the heap (only one instance, if there were many). \nAll the operations were correct, i.e. there was at least one element in the heap each time getMin or removeMin operations were applied.\n\nWhile Petya was away for a lunch, his little brother Vova came to the room, took away some of the pages from Petya's log and used them to make paper boats.\n\nNow Vova is worried, if he made Petya's sequence of operations inconsistent. For example, if one apply operations one-by-one in the order they are written in the event log, results of getMin operations might differ from the results recorded by Petya, and some of getMin or removeMin operations may be incorrect, as the heap is empty at the moment they are applied.\n\nNow Vova wants to add some new operation records to the event log in order to make the resulting sequence of operations correct. That is, the result of each getMin operation is equal to the result in the record, and the heap is non-empty when getMin ad removeMin are applied. Vova wants to complete this as fast as possible, as the Petya may get back at any moment. He asks you to add the least possible number of operation records to the current log. Note that arbitrary number of operations may be added at the beginning, between any two other operations, or at the end of the log.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains the only integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of the records left in Petya's journal.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines describe the records in the current log in the order they are applied. Format described in the statement is used. All numbers in the input are integers not exceeding 109 by their absolute value.. Output specification: The first line of the output should contain a single integer *m*\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible number of records in the modified sequence of operations.\n\nNext *m* lines should contain the corrected sequence of records following the format of the input (described in the statement), one per line and in the order they are applied. All the numbers in the output should be integers not exceeding 109 by their absolute value.\n\nNote that the input sequence of operations must be the subsequence of the output sequence.\n\nIt's guaranteed that there exists the correct answer consisting of no more than 1<=000<=000 operations.\nNote: In the first sample, after number 3 is inserted into the heap, the minimum number is 3. To make the result of the first getMin equal to 4 one should firstly remove number 3 from the heap and then add number 4 into the heap.\n\nIn the second sample case number 1 is inserted two times, so should be similarly removed twice.Complete the following code: ```python\nimport heapq\r\nfrom pprint import pprint\r\n\r\n\r\ndef pop_till_receive(heap, num, seq):\r\n    while heap[0] != num:\r\n        seq.append(seq[-1])\r\n        seq[-2] = \"removeMin\"\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: You may have heard of the pie rule before. It states that if two people wish to fairly share a slice of pie, one person should cut the slice in half, and the other person should choose who gets which slice. Alice and Bob have many slices of pie, and rather than cutting the slices in half, each individual slice will be eaten by just one person.\n\nThe way Alice and Bob decide who eats each slice is as follows. First, the order in which the pies are to be handed out is decided. There is a special token called the \"decider\" token, initially held by Bob. Until all the pie is handed out, whoever has the decider token will give the next slice of pie to one of the participants, and the decider token to the other participant. They continue until no slices of pie are left.\n\nAll of the slices are of excellent quality, so each participant obviously wants to maximize the total amount of pie they get to eat. Assuming both players make their decisions optimally, how much pie will each participant receive?\nInput specification: Input will begin with an integer *N* (1<=\u2264<=*N*<=\u2264<=50), the number of slices of pie. \n\nFollowing this is a line with *N* integers indicating the sizes of the slices (each between 1 and 100000, inclusive), in the order in which they must be handed out.. Output specification: Print two integers. First, the sum of the sizes of slices eaten by Alice, then the sum of the sizes of the slices eaten by Bob, assuming both players make their decisions optimally.\nNote: In the first example, Bob takes the size 141 slice for himself and gives the decider token to Alice. Then Alice gives the size 592 slice to Bob and keeps the decider token for herself, so that she can then give the size 653 slice to herself.Complete the following code: ```python\nimport math\r\nfrom random import random\r\n\r\ndef getInt():\r\n    return(int(input()))\r\n\r\ndef getInts():\r\n    line = input().split()\r\n```"}]}}

Each of the stages is defined by a lowercase Latin letter. This way, the rocket can be described by the string\u00a0\u2014 concatenation of letters, which correspond to the stages.\n\nThere are $n$ stages available. The rocket must contain exactly $k$ of them. Stages in the rocket should be ordered by their weight. So, after the stage with some letter can go only stage with a letter, which is at least two positions after in the alphabet (skipping one letter in between, or even more). For example, after letter 'c' can't go letters 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd', but can go letters 'e', 'f', ..., 'z'.\n\nFor the rocket to fly as far as possible, its weight should be minimal. The weight of the rocket is equal to the sum of the weights of its stages. The weight of the stage is the number of its letter in the alphabet. For example, the stage 'a 'weighs one ton,' b 'weighs two tons, and' z'\u00a0\u2014 $26$ tons.\n\nBuild the rocket with the minimal weight or determine, that it is impossible to build a rocket at all.

Complete the given code for the following problem: The gym leaders were fascinated by the evolutions which took place at Felicity camp. So, they were curious to know about the secret behind evolving Pokemon. \n\nThe organizers of the camp gave the gym leaders a PokeBlock, a sequence of *n* ingredients. Each ingredient can be of type 0 or 1. Now the organizers told the gym leaders that to evolve a Pokemon of type *k* (*k*<=\u2265<=2), they need to make a valid set of *k* cuts on the PokeBlock to get smaller blocks.\n\nSuppose the given PokeBlock sequence is *b*0*b*1*b*2... *b**n*<=-<=1. You have a choice of making cuts at *n*<=+<=1 places, i.e., Before *b*0, between *b*0 and *b*1, between *b*1 and *b*2, ..., between *b**n*<=-<=2 and *b**n*<=-<=1, and after *b**n*<=-<=1.\n\nThe *n*<=+<=1 choices of making cuts are as follows (where a | denotes a possible cut):\n\nConsider a sequence of *k* cuts. Now each pair of consecutive cuts will contain a binary string between them, formed from the ingredient types. The ingredients before the first cut and after the last cut are wasted, which is to say they are not considered. So there will be exactly *k*<=-<=1 such binary substrings. Every substring can be read as a binary number. Let *m* be the maximum number out of the obtained numbers. If all the obtained numbers are positive and the set of the obtained numbers contains all integers from 1 to *m*, then this set of cuts is said to be a valid set of cuts.\n\nFor example, suppose the given PokeBlock sequence is 101101001110 and we made 5 cuts in the following way:\n\nSo the 4 binary substrings obtained are: 11, 010, 01 and 1, which correspond to the numbers 3, 2, 1 and 1 respectively. Here *m*<==<=3, as it is the maximum value among the obtained numbers. And all the obtained numbers are positive and we have obtained all integers from 1 to *m*. Hence this set of cuts is a valid set of 5 cuts.\n\nA Pokemon of type *k* will evolve only if the PokeBlock is cut using a valid set of *k* cuts. There can be many valid sets of the same size. Two valid sets of *k* cuts are considered different if there is a cut in one set which is not there in the other set.\n\nLet *f*(*k*) denote the number of valid sets of *k* cuts. Find the value of .

Output specification: Output a single integer, containing the answer to the problem, i.e., the value of *s* modulo 109<=+<=7.\nNote: In the first sample, the sets of valid cuts are:\n\nSize 2: |1|011, 1|01|1, 10|1|1, 101|1|.\n\nSize 3: |1|01|1, |10|1|1, 10|1|1|, 1|01|1|.\n\nSize 4: |10|1|1|, |1|01|1|.\n\nHence, *f*(2)\u2009=\u20094, *f*(3)\u2009=\u20094 and *f*(4)\u2009=\u20092. So, the value of *s*\u2009=\u200910.\n\nIn the second sample, the set of valid cuts is:\n\nSize 2: |1|0.\n\nHence, *f*(2)\u2009=\u20091 and *f*(3)\u2009=\u20090.

Vasya read in the catalog of products that the company has at its disposal *n* different types of wood. The company uses the *i*-th type of wood to produce a board of this type that is a rectangular *a**i* by *b**i* block.\n\nVasya decided to order boards in this company and build a fence from them. It turned out that the storehouse of the company is so large that Vasya can order arbitrary number of boards of every type. Note that Vasya is allowed to turn the boards as he builds the fence. However, Vasya cannot turn square boards.\n\nVasya is required to construct a fence of length *l*, however, an arbitrary fence won't do. Vasya wants his fence to look beautiful. We'll say that a fence is beautiful if and only if the following two conditions are fulfilled:\n -  there are no two successive boards of the same type -  the first board of the fence has an arbitrary length, and the length of each subsequent board equals the width of the previous one \nIn other words, the fence is considered beautiful, if the type of the *i*-th board in the fence is different from the *i*<=-<=1-th board's type; besides, the *i*-th board's length is equal to the *i*<=-<=1-th board's width (for all *i*, starting from 2).\n\nNow Vasya wonders, how many variants of arranging a fence for his land exist. Your task is to count the number of different beautiful fences of length *l*.\n\nTwo fences will be considered the same if the corresponding sequences of fence boards types and rotations are the same, otherwise the fences are different. Since the sought number can be large enough, you need to calculate the answer modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *l* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100,<=1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=3000) \u2014 the number of different board types and the fence length, correspondingly.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Reforms continue entering Berland. For example, during yesterday sitting the Berland Parliament approved as much as *n* laws (each law has been assigned a unique number from 1 to *n*). Today all these laws were put on the table of the President of Berland, G.W. Boosch, to be signed.\n\nThis time mr. Boosch plans to sign 2*k* laws. He decided to choose exactly two non-intersecting segments of integers from 1 to *n* of length *k* and sign all laws, whose numbers fall into these segments. More formally, mr. Boosch is going to choose two integers *a*, *b* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*k*<=+<=1,<=*b*<=-<=*a*<=\u2265<=*k*) and sign all laws with numbers lying in the segments [*a*;\u00a0*a*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] and [*b*;\u00a0*b*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] (borders are included).\n\nAs mr. Boosch chooses the laws to sign, he of course considers the public opinion. Allberland Public Opinion Study Centre (APOSC) conducted opinion polls among the citizens, processed the results into a report and gave it to the president. The report contains the absurdity value for each law, in the public opinion. As mr. Boosch is a real patriot, he is keen on signing the laws with the maximum total absurdity. Help him.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105, 0<=&lt;<=2*k*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of laws accepted by the parliament and the length of one segment in the law list, correspondingly. The next line contains *n* integers *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n* \u2014 the absurdity of each law (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=109).. Output specification: Print two integers *a*, *b* \u2014 the beginning of segments that mr. Boosch should choose. That means that the president signs laws with numbers from segments [*a*;\u00a0*a*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] and [*b*;\u00a0*b*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1]. If there are multiple solutions, print the one with the minimum number *a*. If there still are multiple solutions, print the one with the minimum *b*.\nNote: In the first sample mr. Boosch signs laws with numbers from segments [1;2] and [4;5]. The total absurdity of the signed laws equals 3\u2009+\u20096\u2009+\u20091\u2009+\u20096\u2009=\u200916.\n\nIn the second sample mr.

He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.\n\nOne day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.\nInput specification: There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number. It is guaranteed that the numbers are made from 0 and 1 only and that their length is same. The numbers may start with 0. The length of each number doesn't exceed 100..

Complete the given code for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the elements of array. \n\nThe third line contains integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs. Separate the numbers by spaces.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nNote: In the first sample Vasya's approach will make one comparison (it starts with the 1-st element and immediately finds the required number), and Petya's approach makes two comparisons (first he compares with the 2-nd array element, doesn't find the search item and compares with the 1-st element).\n\nIn the second sample, on the contrary, Vasya's approach will need two comparisons (first with 1-st element, and then with the 2-nd), and Petya's approach will find the required value in one comparison (the first comparison with the 2-nd element).Complete the following code: ```python\nfrom sys import stdin, stdout\n\n\ndef input():\n    return stdin.readline().strip()\n\n```"}]}}

If Mashmokh pushes button with index *i*, then each light with index not less than *i* that is still turned on turns off.\n\nMashmokh is not very clever. So instead of pushing the first button he pushes some of the buttons randomly each night. He pushed *m* distinct buttons *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (the buttons were pushed consecutively in the given order) this night. Now he wants to know for each light the index of the button that turned this light off.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Let's define the permutation of length *n* as an array *p*<==<=[*p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n*] consisting of *n* distinct integers from range from 1 to *n*. We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value *p*1, value 2 into the value *p*2 and so on.\n\nKyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a permutation. A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle). The cyclic representation is a representation of *p* as a collection of cycles forming *p*. For example, permutation *p*<==<=[4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] has a cyclic representation that looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are swapped, and 5 remains in place. \n\nPermutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya defines the standard cyclic representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first. Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation of [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] is (421)(5)(63).\n\nNow, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For instance, [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] will become [4,<=2,<=1,<=5,<=6,<=3].\n\nKyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of length *n* that do not change in a list in lexicographic order. Unfortunately, his friend Tamaki Suoh lost this list. Kyoya wishes to reproduce the list and he needs your help. Given the integers *n* and *k*, print the permutation that was *k*-th on Kyoya's list.\nInput specification: The first line will contain two integers *n*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*min*{1018,<=*l*} where *l* is the length of the Kyoya's list).. Output specification: Print *n* space-separated integers, representing the permutation that is the answer for the question.\nNote: The standard cycle representation is (1)(32)(4), which after removing parenthesis gives us the original permutation. The first permutation on the list would be [1,\u20092,\u20093,\u20094], while the second permutation would be [1,\u20092,\u20094,\u20093].Complete the following code: ```python\n#!/usr/bin/python3\n\narr = [1] * 51\n\nfor i in range(2, 51):\n    arr[i] = arr[i - 1] + arr[i - 2]\n\n```"}]}}

Each floor has $m$ sections with a single corridor connecting all of them. The sections are enumerated from $1$ to $m$ along the corridor, and all sections with equal numbers on different floors are located exactly one above the other. Thus, the hotel can be represented as a rectangle of height $n$ and width $m$. We can denote sections with pairs of integers $(i, j)$, where $i$ is the floor, and $j$ is the section number on the floor.\n\nThe guests can walk along the corridor on each floor, use stairs and elevators. Each stairs or elevator occupies all sections $(1, x)$, $(2, x)$, $\\ldots$, $(n, x)$ for some $x$ between $1$ and $m$. All sections not occupied with stairs or elevators contain guest rooms. It takes one time unit to move between neighboring sections on the same floor or to move one floor up or down using stairs. It takes one time unit to move up to $v$ floors in any direction using an elevator. You can assume you don't have to wait for an elevator, and the time needed to enter or exit an elevator is negligible.\n\nYou are to process $q$ queries.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Vova is again playing some computer game, now an RPG. In the game Vova's character received a quest: to slay the fearsome monster called Modcrab.\n\nAfter two hours of playing the game Vova has tracked the monster and analyzed its tactics. The Modcrab has *h*2 health points and an attack power of *a*2. Knowing that, Vova has decided to buy a lot of strong healing potions and to prepare for battle.\n\nVova's character has *h*1 health points and an attack power of *a*1. Also he has a large supply of healing potions, each of which increases his current amount of health points by *c*1 when Vova drinks a potion. All potions are identical to each other. It is guaranteed that *c*1<=&gt;<=*a*2.\n\nThe battle consists of multiple phases. In the beginning of each phase, Vova can either attack the monster (thus reducing its health by *a*1) or drink a healing potion (it increases Vova's health by *c*1; Vova's health can exceed *h*1). Then, if the battle is not over yet, the Modcrab attacks Vova, reducing his health by *a*2. The battle ends when Vova's (or Modcrab's) health drops to 0 or lower. It is possible that the battle ends in a middle of a phase after Vova's attack.\n\nOf course, Vova wants to win the fight. But also he wants to do it as fast as possible.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Merge sort is a well-known sorting algorithm. The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:\n 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=\u2264<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* \u2014 *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\nInput specification: The first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it..

For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards.\n\nAs before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8<=\u00d7<=8 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke.\n\nKalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client's requirements.\n\nIt goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything \u2014 for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's needs. You are asked to help Kalevitch with this task.\nInput specification: The input file contains 8 lines, each of the lines contains 8 characters.

Initially we have a sequence consisting of a single element equal to 1. Then we perform (*n*<=-<=1) steps. On each step we take the sequence we've got on the previous step, append it to the end of itself and insert in the middle the minimum positive integer we haven't used before. For example, we get the sequence [1,<=2,<=1] after the first step, the sequence [1,<=2,<=1,<=3,<=1,<=2,<=1] after the second step.\n\nThe task is to find the value of the element with index *k* (the elements are numbered from 1) in the obtained sequence, i.\u00a0e. after (*n*<=-<=1) steps.\n\nPlease help Chloe to solve the problem!\nInput specification: The only line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=2*n*<=-<=1).. Output specification: Print single integer\u00a0\u2014 the integer at the *k*-th position in the obtained sequence.\nNote: In the first sample the obtained sequence is [1,\u20092,\u20091,\u20093,\u20091,\u20092,\u20091].

Complete the given code for the following problem: It's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.\n\nRecently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.\n\nBeing defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.\n\nEach door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number *a*. The second part is either an integer number *b* or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer *c* and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.\n\n*c* is an integer written in base *a*, to open the door we should write it in base *b*. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!\n\nHere's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:\n\nRoman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.:\n-  I=1-  V=5-  X=10-  L=50-  C=100-  D=500-  M=1000\nSymbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1,<=000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.\n\nAlso in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\n\nHelp Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *a* and *b* (2<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=25). Only *b* may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer *c* in base *a* which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. \n\nIt is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.. Output specification: Write a single line that contains integer *c* in base *b*.

Complete the given code for the following problem: There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: \n -  alloc n \u2014 to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; \nThe memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.\n\nThe first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.\nInput specification: The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100;1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *t* \u2014 the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* \u2014 the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.. Output specification: Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession.

For example, number sequence written like \"1,2\u00a0,3,...,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a010\" will be corrected to \"1,\u00a02,\u00a03,\u00a0...,\u00a010\".\n\nIn this task you are given a string *s*, which is composed by a concatination of terms, each of which may be: \n -  a positive integer of an arbitrary length (leading zeroes are not allowed), -  a \"comma\" symbol (\",\"), -  a \"space\" symbol (\" \"), -  \"three dots\" (\"...\", that is, exactly three points written one after another, also known as suspension points). \nPolycarp wants to add and remove spaces in the string *s* to ensure the following: \n -  each comma is followed by exactly one space (if the comma is the last character in the string, this rule does not apply to it), -  each \"three dots\" term is preceded by exactly one space (if the dots are at the beginning of the string, this rule does not apply to the term), -  if two consecutive numbers were separated by spaces only (one or more), then exactly one of them should be left, -  there should not be other spaces. \nAutomate Polycarp's work and write a program that will process the given string *s*.\nInput specification: The input data contains a single string *s*. Its length is from 1 to 255 characters. The string *s* does not begin and end with a space. Its content matches the description given above.. Output specification: Print the string *s* after it is processed. Your program's output should be exactly the same as the expected answer. It is permissible to end output line with a line-break character, and without it.\nNote: noneComplete the following code: ```python\ndef ip():return map(int,input().split())\r\ndef sp():return map(str,input().split(','))\r\ndef li():return list(sp())\r\n\r\ns=li()\r\n#print(s)\r\n```"}]}}

Of course, the round can also have problems with other complexities.\n\nGeorge has a poor imagination.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Far Far Away lived Sam the Farmer. Sam had a cow named Dawn and he was deeply attached to her. Sam would spend the whole summer stocking hay to feed Dawn in winter. Sam scythed hay and put it into haystack. As Sam was a bright farmer, he tried to make the process of storing hay simpler and more convenient to use. He collected the hay into cubical hay blocks of the same size. Then he stored the blocks in his barn. After a summer spent in hard toil Sam stored *A*\u00b7*B*\u00b7*C* hay blocks and stored them in a barn as a rectangular parallelepiped *A* layers high. Each layer had *B* rows and each row had *C* blocks.\n\nAt the end of the autumn Sam came into the barn to admire one more time the hay he'd been stacking during this hard summer. Unfortunately, Sam was horrified to see that the hay blocks had been carelessly scattered around the barn. The place was a complete mess. As it turned out, thieves had sneaked into the barn. They completely dissembled and took away a layer of blocks from the parallelepiped's front, back, top and sides. As a result, the barn only had a parallelepiped containing (*A*<=-<=1)<=\u00d7<=(*B*<=-<=2)<=\u00d7<=(*C*<=-<=2) hay blocks. To hide the evidence of the crime, the thieves had dissembled the parallelepiped into single 1<=\u00d7<=1<=\u00d7<=1 blocks and scattered them around the barn. After the theft Sam counted *n* hay blocks in the barn but he forgot numbers *A*, *B* \u0438 *C*.\n\nGiven number *n*, find the minimally possible and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks.\nInput specification: The only line contains integer *n* from the problem's statement (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=109).. Output specification: Print space-separated minimum and maximum number of hay blocks that could have been stolen by the thieves.\n\nNote that the answer to the problem can be large enough, so you must use the 64-bit integer type for calculations. Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.\nNote: Let's consider the first sample test.

Thus, the thieves could have stolen 32\u2009-\u20094\u2009=\u200928 hay blocks.

Now he needs to choose the cashier to pay for the products.\n\nThere are *n* cashiers at the exit from the supermarket. At the moment the queue for the *i*-th cashier already has *k**i* people. The *j*-th person standing in the queue to the *i*-th cashier has *m**i*,<=*j* items in the basket. Vasya knows that:\n -  the cashier needs 5 seconds to scan one item; -  after the cashier scans each item of some customer, he needs 15 seconds to take the customer's money and give him the change. \nOf course, Vasya wants to select a queue so that he can leave the supermarket as soon as possible. Help him write a program that displays the minimum number of seconds after which Vasya can get to one of the cashiers.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cashes in the shop.

He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of dogs.\nNote: In the first example, we can split the pasture into two halves, one containing wolves and one containing sheep. Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy.

Complete the given code for the following problem: In one little known, but very beautiful country called Waterland, lives a lovely shark Valerie. Like all the sharks, she has several rows of teeth, and feeds on crucians. One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are \"relaxing\".\n\nFor a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap).\n\nIt turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again. \n\nUnhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her. For sure, the shark couldn't say no to her favourite meal, but she had no desire to go back to the dentist. That's why she decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that the viability of no tooth becomes negative. \n\nAs Valerie is not good at mathematics, she asked you to help her to find out the total amount of crucians that she can consume for dinner.\n\nWe should remind you that while eating one crucian Valerie uses exactly one row of teeth and the viability of each tooth from this row decreases by one.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000,<=0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 total amount of Valerie's teeth, amount of tooth rows and amount of crucians in Valerie's portion for dinner.

However, the child is so naughty that he can't wait to destroy the toy.\n\nThe toy consists of *n* parts and *m* ropes. Each rope links two parts, but every pair of parts is linked by at most one rope. To split the toy, the child must remove all its parts. The child can remove a single part at a time, and each remove consume an energy. Let's define an energy value of part *i* as *v**i*.

Also, the statement is true, for example, for a card with 'b' and '4', and for a card with 'b' and '3' (since the letter is not a vowel). The statement is false, for example, for card with 'e' and '5'. You are interested if the statement is true for all cards.

Crucial moment is just around the corner: Gogol is ready to release it's new tablet Lastus 3000.\n\nThis new device is equipped with specially designed artificial intelligence (AI). Employees of Pineapple did their best to postpone the release of Lastus 3000 as long as possible. Finally, they found out, that the name of the new artificial intelligence is similar to the name of the phone, that Pineapple released 200 years ago. As all rights on its name belong to Pineapple, they stand on changing the name of Gogol's artificial intelligence.\n\nPineapple insists, that the name of their phone occurs in the name of AI as a substring. Because the name of technology was already printed on all devices, the Gogol's director decided to replace some characters in AI name with \"#\". As this operation is pretty expensive, you should find the minimum number of characters to replace with \"#\", such that the name of AI doesn't contain the name of the phone as a substring.\n\nSubstring is a continuous subsequence of a string.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains the name of AI designed by Gogol, its length doesn't exceed 100<=000 characters.

That is, letters in pairs \"a\"-\"b\" and \"b\"-\"c\" are neighbouring, while letters \"a\"-\"c\" are not. \nVasya painted the resulting graph near the string and then erased the string. Next day Vasya's friend Petya came to a lecture and found some graph at his desk. He had heard of Vasya's adventure and now he wants to find out whether it could be the original graph *G*, painted by Vasya.

The pack contains cards of 13 values: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jacks, queens, kings and aces. Each value also exists in one of four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. Also, each card earns some value in points assigned to it: cards with value from two to ten earn from 2 to 10 points, correspondingly. An ace can either earn 1 or 11, whatever the player wishes. The picture cards (king, queen and jack) earn 10 points. The number of points a card earns does not depend on the suit. The rules of the game are very simple. The player gets two cards, if the sum of points of those cards equals *n*, then the player wins, otherwise the player loses.\n\nThe player has already got the first card, it's the queen of spades. To evaluate chances for victory, you should determine how many ways there are to get the second card so that the sum of points exactly equals *n*.\nInput specification: The only line contains *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=25) \u2014 the required sum of points.. Output specification: Print the numbers of ways to get the second card in the required way if the first card is the queen of spades.\nNote: In the first sample only four two's of different suits can earn the required sum of points.\n\nIn the second sample we can use all tens, jacks, queens and kings; overall it's 15 cards, as the queen of spades (as any other card) is only present once in the pack of cards and it's already in use.\n\nIn the third sample there is no card, that would add a zero to the current ten points.Complete the following code: ```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict as dd\r\nhp = dd(lambda:4)\r\n\r\n```"}]}}

The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.\nInput specification: There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number. It is guaranteed that the numbers are made from 0 and 1 only and that their length is same. The numbers may start with 0. The length of each number doesn't exceed 100.. Output specification: Write one line \u2014 the corresponding answer. Do not omit the leading 0s.\nNote: noneComplete the following code: ```python\ndef ultra(n,m):\r\n    ans=''\r\n    for i in range(len(n)):\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: Anton likes to listen to fairy tales, especially when Danik, Anton's best friend, tells them. Right now Danik tells Anton a fairy tale:\n\n\"Once upon a time, there lived an emperor. He was very rich and had much grain. One day he ordered to build a huge barn to put there all his grain. Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through. Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...\"\n\nMore formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of *n* grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:\n -  *m* grains are brought to the barn. If *m* grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account). -  Sparrows come and eat grain. In the *i*-th day *i* sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. \nAnton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn. Anton doesn't know when the fairy tale ends, so he asked you to determine, by the end of which day the barn will become empty for the first time. Help Anton and write a program that will determine the number of that day!\nInput specification: The only line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=1018)\u00a0\u2014 the capacity of the barn and the number of grains that are brought every day.. Output specification: Output one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of the day when the barn will become empty for the first time. Days are numbered starting with one.\nNote: In the first sample the capacity of the barn is five grains and two grains are brought every day. The following happens:\n -  At the beginning of the first day grain is brought to the barn. It's full, so nothing happens. -  At the end of the first day one sparrow comes and eats one grain, so 5\u2009-\u20091\u2009=\u20094 grains remain. -  At the beginning of the second day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full and one grain doesn't fit to it. -  At the end of the second day two sparrows come. 5\u2009-\u20092\u2009=\u20093 grains remain. -  At the beginning of the third day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full again. -  At the end of the third day three sparrows come and eat grain. 5\u2009-\u20093\u2009=\u20092 grains remain. -  At the beginning of the fourth day grain is brought again. 2\u2009+\u20092\u2009=\u20094 grains remain. -  At the end of the fourth day four sparrows come and eat grain. 4\u2009-\u20094\u2009=\u20090 grains remain. The barn is empty. \nSo the answer is 4, because by the end of the fourth day the barn becomes empty.Complete the following code: ```python\nimport os\r\nimport sys\r\nimport math\r\nimport random\r\nimport datetime\r\nimport json\r\nimport re\r\nimport sqlite3\r\n```"}]}}

The parent of vertex *i* is vertex *p**i*, the parent index is always less than the index of the vertex (i.e., *p**i*<=&lt;<=*i*).\n\nThe depth of the vertex is the number of nodes on the path from the root to *v* along the edges.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here.

Complete the given code for the following problem: The ancient Berlanders believed that the longer the name, the more important its bearer is. Thus, Berland kings were famous for their long names. But long names are somewhat inconvenient, so the Berlanders started to abbreviate the names of their kings. They called every king by the first letters of its name. Thus, the king, whose name was Victorious Vasily Pupkin, was always called by the berlanders VVP.\n\nIn Berland over its long history many dynasties of kings replaced each other, but they were all united by common traditions. Thus, according to one Berland traditions, to maintain stability in the country, the first name of the heir should be the same as the last name his predecessor (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the heir coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the predecessor). Berlanders appreciate stability, so this tradition has never been broken. Also Berlanders like perfection, so another tradition requires that the first name of the first king in the dynasty coincides with the last name of the last king in this dynasty (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the first king coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the last king). This tradition, of course, has also been always observed.\n\nThe name of a dynasty is formed by very simple rules: we take all the short names of the kings in the order in which they ruled, and write them in one line. Thus, a dynasty of kings \"ab\" and \"ba\" is called \"abba\", and the dynasty, which had only the king \"abca\", is called \"abca\".\n\nVasya, a historian, has recently found a list of abbreviated names of all Berland kings and their relatives.

Besides, the keys are of two types. Some of the keys have lowercase Latin letters on them and some of the keys work like the \"Shift\" key on standard keyboards, that is, they make lowercase letters uppercase.\n\nVasya can press one or two keys with one hand. However, he can only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the keys does not exceed *x*. The keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.\n\nVasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest \"Shift\" key is strictly larger than *x*.

For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.\n\nIt's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.\n\nIt's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.\n\nIn this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.\n\nDetermine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of round participants.\n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains two integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=4126)\u00a0\u2014 the rating of the *i*-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.. Output specification: If the round is rated for sure, print \"rated\". If the round is unrated for sure, print \"unrated\". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print \"maybe\".\nNote: In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.\n\nIn the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.\n\nIn the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.Complete the following code: ```python\nif str is bytes:\n    from itertools import izip as zip\n\ndef is_sorted(l):\n    return all(a >= b for a, b in zip(l, l[1:]))\n\nn = int(input())\n\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: Vasilisa the Wise from the Kingdom of Far Far Away got a magic box with a secret as a present from her friend Hellawisa the Wise from the Kingdom of A Little Closer. However, Vasilisa the Wise does not know what the box's secret is, since she cannot open it again. She hopes that you will help her one more time with that.\n\nThe box's lock looks as follows: it contains 4 identical deepenings for gems as a 2<=\u00d7<=2 square, and some integer numbers are written at the lock's edge near the deepenings. The example of a lock is given on the picture below.\n\nThe box is accompanied with 9 gems. Their shapes match the deepenings' shapes and each gem contains one number from 1 to 9 (each number is written on exactly one gem). The box will only open after it is decorated with gems correctly: that is, each deepening in the lock should be filled with exactly one gem. Also, the sums of numbers in the square's rows, columns and two diagonals of the square should match the numbers written at the lock's edge. For example, the above lock will open if we fill the deepenings with gems with numbers as is shown on the picture below.\n\nNow Vasilisa the Wise wants to define, given the numbers on the box's lock, which gems she should put in the deepenings to open the box. Help Vasilisa to solve this challenging task.\nInput specification: The input contains numbers written on the edges of the lock of the box. The first line contains space-separated integers *r*1 and *r*2 that define the required sums of numbers in the rows of the square. The second line contains space-separated integers *c*1 and *c*2 that define the required sums of numbers in the columns of the square.

Correspondence between the above 6 variables and places where they are written is shown on the picture below. For more clarifications please look at the second sample test that demonstrates the example given in the problem statement.. Output specification: Print the scheme of decorating the box with stones: two lines containing two space-separated integers from 1 to 9. The numbers should be pairwise different. If there is no solution for the given lock, then print the single number \"-1\" (without the quotes).\n\nIf there are several solutions, output any.\nNote: Pay attention to the last test from the statement: it is impossible to open the box because for that Vasilisa the Wise would need 4 identical gems containing number \"5\".

Complete the given code for the following problem: Kuro is living in a country called Uberland, consisting of $n$ towns, numbered from $1$ to $n$, and $n - 1$ bidirectional roads connecting these towns. It is possible to reach each town from any other. Each road connects two towns $a$ and $b$. Kuro loves walking and he is planning to take a walking marathon, in which he will choose a pair of towns $(u, v)$ ($u \\neq v$) and walk from $u$ using the shortest path to $v$ (note that $(u, v)$ is considered to be different from $(v, u)$).\n\nOddly, there are 2 special towns in Uberland named Flowrisa (denoted with the index $x$) and Beetopia (denoted with the index $y$). Flowrisa is a town where there are many strong-scent flowers, and Beetopia is another town where many bees live. In particular, Kuro will avoid any pair of towns $(u, v)$ if on the path from $u$ to $v$, he reaches Beetopia after he reached Flowrisa, since the bees will be attracted with the flower smell on Kuro\u2019s body and sting him.\n\nKuro wants to know how many pair of city $(u, v)$ he can take as his route. Since he\u2019s not really bright, he asked you to help him with this problem.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers $n$, $x$ and $y$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\leq x, y \\leq n$, $x \\ne y$) - the number of towns, index of the town Flowrisa and index of the town Beetopia, respectively.\n\n$n - 1$ lines follow, each line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$, $a \\ne b$), describes a road connecting two towns $a$ and $b$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that from each town, we can reach every other town in the city using the given roads. That is, the given map of towns and roads is a tree.. Output specification: A single integer resembles the number of pair of towns $(u, v)$ that Kuro can use as his walking route.\nNote: On the first example, Kuro can choose these pairs: \n -  $(1, 2)$: his route would be $1 \\rightarrow 2$, -  $(2, 3)$: his route would be $2 \\rightarrow 3$, -  $(3, 2)$: his route would be $3 \\rightarrow 2$, -  $(2, 1)$: his route would be $2 \\rightarrow 1$, -  $(3, 1)$: his route would be $3 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1$. \nKuro can't choose pair $(1, 3)$ since his walking route would be $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3$, in which Kuro visits town $1$ (Flowrisa) and then visits town $3$ (Beetopia), which is not allowed (note that pair $(3, 1)$ is still allowed because although Kuro visited Flowrisa and Beetopia, he did not visit them in that order).\n\nOn the second example, Kuro can choose the following pairs: \n -  $(1, 2)$: his route would be $1 \\rightarrow 2$, -  $(2, 1)$: his route would be $2 \\rightarrow 1$, -  $(3, 2)$: his route would be $3 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 2$, -  $(3, 1)$: his route would be $3 \\rightarrow 1$.Complete the following code: ```python\nn,x,y=map(int,input().split(' '));x-=1;y-=1\r\nadjli=[];parent=[];\r\nfor i in range(n):\r\n\tadjli.append([]);parent.append(-1);\r\nfor _ in range(n-1):\r\n\tu,v=map(int,input().split(' '))\r\n\tadjli[u-1].append(v-1);\r\n\tadjli[v-1].append(u-1);\r\n```"}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Complete the given code for the following problem: Petya loves computer games. Finally a game that he's been waiting for so long came out!\n\nThe main character of this game has *n* different skills, each of which is characterized by an integer *a**i* from 0 to 100. The higher the number *a**i* is, the higher is the *i*-th skill of the character. The total rating of the character is calculated as the sum of the values \u200b\u200bof  for all *i* from 1 to *n*. The expression \u230a *x*\u230b denotes the result of rounding the number *x* down to the nearest integer.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Petya got *k* improvement units as a bonus that he can use to increase the skills of his character and his total rating. One improvement unit can increase any skill of Petya's character by exactly one. For example, if *a*4<==<=46, after using one imporvement unit to this skill, it becomes equal to 47. A hero's skill cannot rise higher more than 100. Thus, it is permissible that some of the units will remain unused.\n\nYour task is to determine the optimal way of using the improvement units so as to maximize the overall rating of the character. It is not necessary to use all the improvement units.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two positive integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=107) \u2014 the number of skills of the character and the number of units of improvements at Petya's disposal.\n\nThe second line of the input contains a sequence of *n* integers *a**i* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100), where *a**i* characterizes the level of the *i*-th skill of the character.. Output specification: The first line of the output should contain a single non-negative integer \u2014 the maximum total rating of the character that Petya can get using *k* or less improvement units.\nNote: In the first test case the optimal strategy is as follows. Petya has to improve the first skill to 10 by spending 3 improvement units, and the second skill to 10, by spending one improvement unit. Thus, Petya spends all his improvement units and the total rating of the character becomes equal to  *lfloor* *frac*{100}{10} *rfloor*\u2009+\u2009 *lfloor* *frac*{100}{10} *rfloor*\u2009=\u200910\u2009+\u200910\u2009=\u2009 20.\n\nIn the second test the optimal strategy for Petya is to improve the first skill to 20 (by spending 3 improvement units) and to improve the third skill to 20 (in this case by spending 1 improvement units). Thus, Petya is left with 4 improvement units and he will be able to increase the second skill to 19 (which does not change the overall rating, so Petya does not necessarily have to do it). Therefore, the highest possible total rating in this example is <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/ccaa4e1e435ea3a339c322e03a32de69d214a257.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>.\n\nIn the third test case the optimal strategy for Petya is to increase the first skill to 100 by spending 1 improvement unit. Thereafter, both skills of the character will be equal to 100, so Petya will not be able to spend the remaining improvement unit. So the answer is equal to <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/b246630ca7d1b95b91970759bd8455cb3e930bf9.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>.Complete the following code: ```python\nfrom os import path\r\nfrom sys import stdin, stdout\r\n\r\n\r\nfilename = \"../templates/input.txt\"\r\nif path.exists(filename):\r\n    stdin = open(filename, 'r')\r\n\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: Each item in the game has a level. The higher the level is, the higher basic parameters the item has. We shall consider only the following basic parameters: attack (atk), defense (def) and resistance to different types of impact (res).\n\nEach item belongs to one class. In this problem we will only consider three of such classes: weapon, armor, orb.\n\nBesides, there's a whole new world hidden inside each item. We can increase an item's level travelling to its world. We can also capture the so-called residents in the Item World\n\nResidents are the creatures that live inside items. Each resident gives some bonus to the item in which it is currently located. We will only consider residents of types: gladiator (who improves the item's atk), sentry (who improves def) and physician (who improves res).\n\nEach item has the size parameter. The parameter limits the maximum number of residents that can live inside an item. We can move residents between items. Within one moment of time we can take some resident from an item and move it to some other item if it has a free place for a new resident. We cannot remove a resident from the items and leave outside \u2014 any of them should be inside of some item at any moment of time.\n\nLaharl has a certain number of items. He wants to move the residents between items so as to equip himself with weapon, armor and a defensive orb. The weapon's atk should be largest possible in the end. Among all equipping patterns containing weapon's maximum atk parameter we should choose the ones where the armor\u2019s def parameter is the largest possible. Among all such equipment patterns we should choose the one where the defensive orb would have the largest possible res parameter.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Leha is planning his journey from Moscow to Saratov. He hates trains, so he has decided to get from one city to another by car.\n\nThe path from Moscow to Saratov can be represented as a straight line (well, it's not that straight in reality, but in this problem we will consider it to be straight), and the distance between Moscow and Saratov is $n$ km. Let's say that Moscow is situated at the point with coordinate $0$ km, and Saratov \u2014 at coordinate $n$ km.\n\nDriving for a long time may be really difficult. Formally, if Leha has already covered $i$ kilometers since he stopped to have a rest, he considers the difficulty of covering $(i + 1)$-th kilometer as $a_{i + 1}$. It is guaranteed that for every $i \\in [1, n - 1]$ $a_i \\le a_{i + 1}$. The difficulty of the journey is denoted as the sum of difficulties of each kilometer in the journey.\n\nFortunately, there may be some rest sites between Moscow and Saratov. Every integer point from $1$ to $n - 1$ may contain a rest site. When Leha enters a rest site, he may have a rest, and the next kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the kilometer after it \u2014 difficulty $a_2$, and so on.\n\nFor example, if $n = 5$ and there is a rest site in coordinate $2$, the difficulty of journey will be $2a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3$: the first kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the second one \u2014 $a_2$, then Leha will have a rest, and the third kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the fourth \u2014 $a_2$, and the last one \u2014 $a_3$. Another example: if $n = 7$ and there are rest sites in coordinates $1$ and $5$, the difficulty of Leha's journey is $3a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3 + a_4$.\n\nLeha doesn't know which integer points contain rest sites. So he has to consider every possible situation. Obviously, there are $2^{n - 1}$ different distributions of rest sites (two distributions are different if there exists some point $x$ such that it contains a rest site in exactly one of these distributions). Leha considers all these distributions to be equiprobable. He wants to calculate $p$ \u2014 the expected value of difficulty of his journey.\n\nObviously, $p \\cdot 2^{n - 1}$ is an integer number. You have to calculate it modulo $998244353$.\nInput specification: The first line contains one number $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^6$) \u2014 the distance from Moscow to Saratov.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integer numbers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($1 \\le a_1 \\le a_2 \\le \\dots \\le a_n \\le 10^6$), where $a_i$ is the difficulty of $i$-th kilometer after Leha has rested..

As a compensation, Seryozha made Dima do his homework.\n\nThe teacher gave Seryozha the coordinates of *n* distinct points on the abscissa axis and asked to consecutively connect them by semi-circus in a certain order: first connect the first point with the second one, then connect the second point with the third one, then the third one with the fourth one and so on to the *n*-th point. Two points with coordinates (*x*1,<=0) and (*x*2,<=0) should be connected by a semi-circle that passes above the abscissa axis with the diameter that coincides with the segment between points. Seryozha needs to find out if the line on the picture intersects itself. For clarifications, see the picture Seryozha showed to Dima (the left picture has self-intersections, the right picture doesn't have any).\n\nSeryozha is not a small boy, so the coordinates of the points can be rather large.

Its main functionality is that two members can become friends (then they can talk with each other and share funny pictures).\n\nThere are *n* members, numbered 1 through *n*. *m* pairs of members are friends. Of course, a member can't be a friend with themselves.\n\nLet A-B denote that members A and B are friends. Limak thinks that a network is reasonable if and only if the following condition is satisfied: For every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z then also X-Z.\n\nFor example: if Alan and Bob are friends, and Bob and Ciri are friends, then Alan and Ciri should be friends as well.\n\nCan you help Limak and check if the network is reasonable?

By applying it once to a string, he can swap any two characters of this string. The guys do not know anything about the suffix tree, but it can help them do much more. \n\nBizon the Champion wonders whether the \"Bizons\" can solve the problem. Perhaps, the solution do not require both data structures. Find out whether the guys can solve the problem and if they can, how do they do it?

Complete the given code for the following problem: Kicker (table football) is a board game based on football, in which players control the footballers' figures mounted on rods by using bars to get the ball into the opponent's goal. When playing two on two, one player of each team controls the goalkeeper and the full-backs (plays defence), the other player controls the half-backs and forwards (plays attack).\n\nTwo teams of company Q decided to battle each other. Let's enumerate players from both teams by integers from 1 to 4. The first and second player play in the first team, the third and the fourth one play in the second team. For each of the four players we know their game skills in defence and attack. The defence skill of the *i*-th player is *a**i*, the attack skill is *b**i*.\n\nBefore the game, the teams determine how they will play. First the players of the first team decide who will play in the attack, and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do the same, based on the choice of their opponents.\n\nWe will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.\n\nThe teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally. Identify the team that is guaranteed to win (if both teams act optimally) or tell that there is no such team.\nInput specification: The input contain the players' description in four lines. The *i*-th line contains two space-separated integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the defence and the attack skill of the *i*-th player, correspondingly.. Output specification: If the first team can win, print phrase \"Team 1\" (without the quotes), if the second team can win, print phrase \"Team 2\" (without the quotes). If no of the teams can definitely win, print \"Draw\" (without the quotes).\nNote: Let consider the first test sample. The first team can definitely win if it will choose the following arrangement: the first player plays attack, the second player plays defence.\n\nConsider the second sample. The order of the choosing roles for players makes sense in this sample. As the members of the first team choose first, the members of the second team can beat them (because they know the exact defence value and attack value of the first team).Complete the following code: ```python\np11 = list(map(int, input().split()))\r\np12 = list(map(int, input().split()))\r\np21 = list(map(int, input().split()))\r\np22 = list(map(int, input().split()))\r\n\r\ndef f(a, b, c, d):\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: Since Sonya is interested in robotics too, she decided to construct robots that will read and recognize numbers.\n\nSonya has drawn $n$ numbers in a row, $a_i$ is located in the $i$-th position. She also has put a robot at each end of the row (to the left of the first number and to the right of the last number). Sonya will give a number to each robot (they can be either same or different) and run them. When a robot is running, it is moving toward to another robot, reading numbers in the row. When a robot is reading a number that is equal to the number that was given to that robot, it will turn off and stay in the same position.\n\nSonya does not want robots to break, so she will give such numbers that robots will stop before they meet. That is, the girl wants them to stop at different positions so that the first robot is to the left of the second one.\n\nFor example, if the numbers $[1, 5, 4, 1, 3]$ are written, and Sonya gives the number $1$ to the first robot and the number $4$ to the second one, the first robot will stop in the $1$-st position while the second one in the $3$-rd position. In that case, robots will not meet each other. As a result, robots will not be broken. But if Sonya gives the number $4$ to the first robot and the number $5$ to the second one, they will meet since the first robot will stop in the $3$-rd position while the second one is in the $2$-nd position.\n\nSonya understands that it does not make sense to give a number that is not written in the row because a robot will not find this number and will meet the other robot.\n\nSonya is now interested in finding the number of different pairs that she can give to robots so that they will not meet. In other words, she wants to know the number of pairs ($p$, $q$), where she will give $p$ to the first robot and $q$ to the second one. Pairs ($p_i$, $q_i$) and ($p_j$, $q_j$) are different if $p_i\\neq p_j$ or $q_i\\neq q_j$.\n\nUnfortunately, Sonya is busy fixing robots that broke after a failed launch. That is why she is asking you to find the number of pairs that she can give to robots so that they will not meet.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1\\leq n\\leq 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of numbers in a row.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1\\leq a_i\\leq 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the numbers in a row..

Complete the given code for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes. The second line contains integers *x**c* and *y**c* \u2014 the initial square's coordinates (1<=\u2264<=*x**c*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y**c*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nThe third line contains an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the number of vectors. Then follow *k* lines, each of them contains two integers *dx**i* and *dy**i* (|*dx**i*|,<=|*dy**i*|<=\u2264<=109,<=|*dx*|<=+<=|*dy*|<=\u2265<=1).. Output specification: Print the single number \u2014 the number of steps Vasya had made.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.\nNote: In the first sample Vasya is initially positioned at square (1,\u20091) and makes 3 steps by the first vector (1,\u20091). So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091). He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard.Complete the following code: ```python\ndef check(x,y):\r\n    global n,m\r\n    if x>0 and x<=n and y>0 and y<=m:\r\n        return True\r\n    return False\r\n```"}]}}

For example, each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform and guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Polycarp thinks about the meaning of life very often. He does this constantly, even when typing in the editor. Every time he starts brooding he can no longer fully concentrate and repeatedly presses the keys that need to be pressed only once. For example, instead of the phrase \"how are you\" he can type \"hhoow aaaare yyoouu\". \n\nPolycarp decided to automate the process of correcting such errors. He decided to write a plug-in to the text editor that will remove pairs of identical consecutive letters (if there are any in the text). Of course, this is not exactly what Polycarp needs, but he's got to start from something! \n\nHelp Polycarp and write the main plug-in module. Your program should remove from a string all pairs of identical letters, which are consecutive. If after the removal there appear new pairs, the program should remove them as well. Technically, its work should be equivalent to the following: while the string contains a pair of consecutive identical letters, the pair should be deleted. Note that deleting of the consecutive identical letters can be done in any order, as any order leads to the same result.\nInput specification: The input data consists of a single line to be processed.

Will the equation remain correct after removing all zeros?\n\nFor example if the equation is 101<=+<=102<==<=203, if we removed all zeros it will be 11<=+<=12<==<=23 which is still a correct equation.\n\nBut if the equation is 105<=+<=106<==<=211, if we removed all zeros it will be 15<=+<=16<==<=211 which is not a correct equation.\nInput specification: The input will consist of two lines, the first line will contain the integer *a*, and the second line will contain the integer *b* which are in the equation as described above (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=109). There won't be any leading zeros in both. The value of *c* should be calculated as *c*<==<=*a*<=+<=*b*.. Output specification: The output will be just one line, you should print \"YES\" if the equation will remain correct after removing all zeros, and print \"NO\" otherwise.\nNote: noneComplete the following code: ```python\na = input()\r\nb = input()\r\nc = int(a) + int(b)\r\n\r\n```"}]}}

The education is not easy because you need to have fundamental knowledge in different areas, which sometimes are not related to each other. \n\nFor example, you should know linguistics very well. You learn a structure of Reberland language as foreign language. In this language words are constructed according to the following rules. First you need to choose the \"root\" of the word \u2014 some string which has more than 4 letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3 symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction \u2014  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row. All these strings are considered to be suffixes of the word (this time we use word \"suffix\" to describe a morpheme but not the few last characters of the string as you may used to). \n\nHere is one exercise that you have found in your task list. You are given the word *s*. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language. \n\nTwo strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match. \n\nLet's look at the example: the word *abacabaca* is given. This word can be obtained in the following ways: , where the root of the word is overlined, and suffixes are marked by \"corners\". Thus, the set of possible suffixes for this word is {*aca*,<=*ba*,<=*ca*}.\nInput specification: The only line contains a string *s* (5<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=104) consisting of lowercase English letters..

Of course, big snacks should be at the bottom of the tower, while small snacks should be at the top.\n\nYears passed, and once different snacks started to fall onto the city, and the residents began to build the Snacktower.\n\nHowever, they faced some troubles. Each day exactly one snack fell onto the city, but their order was strange. So, at some days the residents weren't able to put the new stack on the top of the Snacktower: they had to wait until all the bigger snacks fell.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Complete the given code for the following problem: Petya wrote a programme on C++ that calculated a very interesting function *f*(*n*). Petya ran the program with a certain value of *n* and went to the kitchen to have some tea. The history has no records concerning how long the program had been working. By the time Petya returned, it had completed the calculations and had the result. However while Petya was drinking tea, a sly virus managed to destroy the input file so that Petya can't figure out for which value of *n* the program was run. Help Petya, carry out the inverse function!\n\nMostly, the program consists of a function in C++ with the following simplified syntax:\n -  *function* ::= int f(int n) {*operatorSequence*}-  *operatorSequence* ::= *operator*\u00a0|\u00a0*operator*\u00a0*operatorSequence*-  *operator* ::= return *arithmExpr*; | if (*logicalExpr*) return *arithmExpr*;-  *logicalExpr* ::= *arithmExpr*<=&gt;<=*arithmExpr* | *arithmExpr*<=&lt;<=*arithmExpr* | *arithmExpr* == *arithmExpr*-  *arithmExpr* ::= *sum*-  *sum* ::= *product* | *sum*<=+<=*product* | *sum*<=-<=*product*-  *product* ::= *multiplier* | *product*<=*<=*multiplier* | *product*<=/<=*multiplier*-  *multiplier* ::= n | *number* | f(*arithmExpr*)-  *number* ::= 0|1|2|... |32767 \nThe whitespaces in a *operatorSequence* are optional.\n\nThus, we have a function, in which body there are two kinds of operators. There is the operator \"return *arithmExpr*;\" that returns the value of the expression as the value of the function, and there is the conditional operator \"if (*logicalExpr*) return *arithmExpr*;\" that returns the value of the arithmetical expression when and only when the logical expression is true. Guaranteed that no other constructions of C++ language \u2014 cycles, assignment operators, nested conditional operators etc, and other variables except the *n* parameter are used in the function. All the constants are integers in the interval [0..32767].\n\nThe operators are performed sequentially. After the function has returned a value other operators in the sequence are not performed. Arithmetical expressions are performed taking into consideration the standard priority of the operations. It means that first all the products that are part of the sum are calculated. During the calculation of the products the operations of multiplying and division are performed from the left to the right. Then the summands are summed, and the addition and the subtraction are also performed from the left to the right. Operations \"&gt;\" (more), \"&lt;\" (less) and \"==\" (equals) also have standard meanings.\n\nNow you've got to pay close attention! The program is compiled with the help of 15-bit Berland C++ compiler invented by a Berland company BerSoft, that's why arithmetical operations are performed in a non-standard way. Addition, subtraction and multiplication are performed modulo 32768 (if the result of subtraction is negative, then 32768 is added to it until the number belongs to the interval [0..32767]). Division \"/\" is a usual integer division where the remainder is omitted.\n\nExamples of arithmetical operations: \n\nGuaranteed that for all values of *n* from 0 to 32767 the given function is performed correctly. That means that:\n\n1. Division by 0 never occures.\n\n2. When performing a function for the value *n*<==<=*N* recursive calls of the function *f* may occur only for the parameter value of 0,<=1,<=...,<=*N*<=-<=1. Consequently, the program never has an infinite recursion.\n\n3. As the result of the sequence of the operators, the function always returns a value.\n\nWe have to mention that due to all the limitations the value returned by the function *f* is independent from either global variables or the order of performing the calculations of arithmetical expressions as part of the logical one, or from anything else except the value of *n* parameter. That's why the *f* function can be regarded as a function in its mathematical sense, i.e. as a unique correspondence between any value of *n* from the interval [0..32767] and a value of *f*(*n*) from the same interval.\n\nGiven the value of *f*(*n*), and you should find *n*. If the suitable *n* value is not unique, you should find the maximal one (from the interval [0..32767]).\nInput specification: The first line has an integer *f*(*n*) from the interval [0..32767]. The next lines have the description of the function *f*. In the description can be found extra spaces and line breaks (see the examples) which, of course, can\u2019t break key words int, if, return and numbers. The size of input data can\u2019t exceed 100 bytes.. Output specification: Output a single number \u2014 the answer to the problem. If there\u2019s no answer, output \"-1\" (without quotes).\nNote: noneComplete the following code: ```python\nimport re, sys, functools\r\n\r\ndef cut_modulo(x):\r\n    y = x % 32768\r\n    if (y < 0):\r\n        y += 32768\r\n    return y\r\n\r\n```"}]}}

In particular, he needs to automate the hard decision: which main characters will get married by the end of the series.\n\nThere are *n* single men and *n* single women among the main characters. An opinion poll showed that viewers like several couples, and a marriage of any of them will make the audience happy. The Smart Beaver formalized this fact as *k* triples of numbers (*h*,<=*w*,<=*r*), where *h* is the index of the man, *w* is the index of the woman, and *r* is the measure of the audience's delight in case of the marriage of this couple. The same poll showed that the marriage of any other couple will leave the audience indifferent, so the screenwriters decided not to include any such marriages in the plot.\n\nThe script allows you to arrange several marriages between the heroes or not to arrange marriages at all. A subset of some of the *k* marriages is considered acceptable if each man and each woman is involved in at most one marriage of the subset (the series won't allow any divorces). The value of the acceptable set of marriages is the total delight the spectators will get from the marriages included in this set.\n\nObviously, there is a finite number of acceptable sets, and they all describe some variants of the script. The screenwriters do not want to choose a set with maximum value \u2014 it would make the plot too predictable. So the Smart Beaver offers the following option: sort all the acceptable sets in increasing order of value and choose the *t*-th set from the sorted list. Thus, *t*<==<=1 corresponds to a plot without marriages, *t*<==<=2 \u2014 to a single marriage resulting in minimal delight for the audience, and so on.\n\nHelp the Beaver to implement the algorithm for selecting the desired set.\nInput specification: The first input line contains integers *n*, *k* and *t* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*min*(100,<=*n*2), 1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105), separated by single spaces.

Some characters are friends to each other, and they share information they got. Also Vova knows that he can bribe each character so he or she starts spreading the rumor; *i*-th character wants *c**i* gold in exchange for spreading the rumor. When a character hears the rumor, he tells it to all his friends, and they start spreading the rumor to their friends (for free), and so on.\n\nThe quest is finished when all *n* characters know the rumor. What is the minimum amount of gold Vova needs to spend in order to finish the quest?\n\nTake a look at the notes if you think you haven't understood the problem completely.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integer numbers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105,<=0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of characters in Overcity and the number of pairs of friends.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integer numbers *c**i* (0<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the amount of gold *i*-th character asks to start spreading the rumor.\n\nThen *m* lines follow, each containing a pair of numbers (*x**i*,<=*y**i*) which represent that characters *x**i* and *y**i* are friends (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, *x**i*<=\u2260<=*y**i*). It is guaranteed that each pair is listed at most once.. Output specification: Print one number \u2014 the minimum amount of gold Vova has to spend in order to finish the quest.\nNote: In the first example the best decision is to bribe the first character (he will spread the rumor to fourth character, and the fourth one will spread it to fifth). Also Vova has to bribe the second and the third characters, so they know the rumor.\n\nIn the second example Vova has to bribe everyone.\n\nIn the third example the optimal decision is to bribe the first, the third, the fifth, the seventh and the ninth characters.Complete the following code: ```python\nimport sys\r\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\r\n\r\n\r\ndef inInt():\r\n    return int(input())\r\n\r\n\r\n```"}]}}

Her friend Dasha told Masha about a way to determine the phone number of one's Prince Charming through arithmancy. \n\nThe phone number is divined like that. First one needs to write down one's own phone numbers. For example, let's suppose that Masha's phone number is 12345. After that one should write her favorite digit from 0 to 9 under the first digit of her number. That will be the first digit of the needed number. For example, Masha's favorite digit is 9. The second digit is determined as a half sum of the second digit of Masha's number and the already written down first digit from her beloved one's number. In this case the arithmetic average equals to (2<=+<=9)<=/<=2<==<=5.5. Masha can round the number up or down, depending on her wishes. For example, she chooses the digit 5. Having written down the resulting digit under the second digit of her number, Masha moves to finding the third digit in the same way, i.e. finding the half sum the the third digit of her number and the second digit of the new number. The result is (5<=+<=3)<=/<=2<==<=4. In this case the answer is unique. Thus, every *i*-th digit is determined as an arithmetic average of the *i*-th digit of Masha's number and the *i*<=-<=1-th digit of her true love's number.

Horrible! \n\nAside from loving sweet things, thieves from this area are known to be very greedy. So after a thief takes his number of chocolates for himself, the next thief will take exactly *k* times more than the previous one. The value of *k* (*k*<=&gt;<=1) is a secret integer known only to them. It is also known that each thief's bag can carry at most *n* chocolates (if they intend to take more, the deal is cancelled) and that there were exactly four thieves involved. \n\nSadly, only the thieves know the value of *n*, but rumours say that the numbers of ways they could have taken the chocolates (for a fixed *n*, but not fixed *k*) is *m*. Two ways are considered different if one of the thieves (they should be numbered in the order they take chocolates) took different number of chocolates in them.\n\nMike want to track the thieves down, so he wants to know what their bags are and value of *n* will help him in that.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$.. Output specification: Print the only integer \u2014 maximum possible total time when the lamp is lit.\nNote: In the first example, one of possible optimal solutions is to insert value $x = 3$ before $a_1$, so program will be $[3, 4, 6, 7]$ and time of lamp being lit equals $(3 - 0) + (6 - 4) + (10 - 7) = 8$. Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$.Complete the following code: ```python\n# template begins\n#####################################\nimport enum\nfrom io import BytesIO, IOBase\nfrom mimetypes import suffix_map\nimport sys\nimport math\nimport os\n```"}]}}

First the first child throws the ball to the next one clockwise, i.e. to the child number 2. Then the child number 2 throws the ball to the next but one child, i.e. to the child number 4, then the fourth child throws the ball to the child that stands two children away from him, i.e. to the child number 7, then the ball is thrown to the child who stands 3 children away from the child number 7, then the ball is thrown to the child who stands 4 children away from the last one, and so on.

As a result, the Kingdom healers had already had three appointments with the merchants who were asked to sell, say, exactly 0.273549107 beer barrels. To deal with the problem somehow, the King issued an order obliging rounding up all numbers to the closest integer to simplify calculations. Specifically, the order went like this:\n-  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is strictly less than 0.5, then the rounded up number coincides with the number\u2019s integer part. -  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is not less than 0.5, the rounded up number is obtained if we add 1 to the last digit of the number\u2019s integer part.-  If the number\u2019s integer part ends with digit 9, to round up the numbers one should go to Vasilisa the Wise. In the whole Kingdom she is the only one who can perform the tricky operation of carrying into the next position. \nMerchants found the algorithm very sophisticated and they asked you (the ACMers) to help them.

Help Petya carry out the plan.\n\nA spider consists of *k* beads tied together by *k*<=-<=1 threads. Each thread connects two different beads, at that any pair of beads that make up a spider is either directly connected by a thread, or is connected via some chain of threads and beads.\n\nPetya may glue spiders together directly gluing their beads. The length of each thread equals 1. The sizes of the beads can be neglected. That's why we can consider that gluing spiders happens by identifying some of the beads (see the picture). Besides, the construction resulting from the gluing process should also represent a spider, that is, it should have the given features. \n\nAfter Petya glues all spiders together, he measures the length of the resulting toy.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Vasya plays a computer game with ninjas. At this stage Vasya's ninja should get out of a deep canyon.\n\nThe canyon consists of two vertical parallel walls, their height is *n* meters. Let's imagine that we split these walls into 1 meter-long areas and number them with positive integers from 1 to *n* from bottom to top. Some areas are safe and the ninja can climb them. Others are spiky and ninja can't be there. Let's call such areas dangerous.\n\nInitially the ninja is on the lower area of the left wall. He can use each second to perform one of the following actions: \n -  climb one area up; -  climb one area down; -  jump to the opposite wall. That gets the ninja to the area that is exactly *k* meters higher than the area he jumped from. More formally, if before the jump the ninja is located at area *x* of one wall, then after the jump he is located at area *x*<=+<=*k* of the other wall. \nIf at some point of time the ninja tries to get to an area with a number larger than *n*, then we can assume that the ninja got out of the canyon.\n\nThe canyon gets flooded and each second the water level raises one meter.

We can assume that the ninja and the water \"move in turns\" \u2014 first the ninja performs some action, then the water raises for one meter, then the ninja performs one more action and so on.\n\nThe level is considered completed if the ninja manages to get out of the canyon.\n\nAfter several failed attempts Vasya started to doubt whether it is possible to complete the level at all.

Complete the given code for the following problem: It's the end of July\u00a0\u2013 the time when a festive evening is held at Jelly Castle! Guests from all over the kingdom gather here to discuss new trends in the world of confectionery. Yet some of the things discussed here are not supposed to be disclosed to the general public: the information can cause discord in the kingdom of Sweetland in case it turns out to reach the wrong hands. So it's a necessity to not let any uninvited guests in.\n\nThere are 26 entrances in Jelly Castle, enumerated with uppercase English letters from A to Z. Because of security measures, each guest is known to be assigned an entrance he should enter the castle through. The door of each entrance is opened right before the first guest's arrival and closed right after the arrival of the last guest that should enter the castle through this entrance. No two guests can enter the castle simultaneously.\n\nFor an entrance to be protected from possible intrusion, a candy guard should be assigned to it. There are *k* such guards in the castle, so if there are more than *k* opened doors, one of them is going to be left unguarded! Notice that a guard can't leave his post until the door he is assigned to is closed.\n\nSlastyona had a suspicion that there could be uninvited guests at the evening.

For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards.\n\nAs before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8<=\u00d7<=8 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke.\n\nKalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client's requirements.\n\nIt goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything \u2014 for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's needs.

On the first day on the planet the Beaver takes a walk and gets to know the citizens. On the second and all subsequent days the Beaver gives presents to the citizens \u2014 each of the *b**i* citizens gets one present per day. The Beaver leaves the planet in the evening of the day when the number of presents left is strictly less than the number of citizens (i.e. as soon as he won't be able to give away the proper number of presents the next day).

For example, it can move to the left and eat asterisk in position 5 (in 1 time unit) and then move from the position 5 to the right and eat asterisk in the position 7 (in 2 time units). So in 3 time units Packmen will eat all asterisks on the game field.\n\nIn the second example Packman in the position 4 will move to the left and after 2 time units will eat asterisks in positions 3 and 2. Packmen in positions 5 and 8 will move to the right and in 2 time units will eat asterisks in positions 7 and 10, respectively. So 2 time units is enough for Packmen to eat all asterisks on the game field.Complete the following code: ```python\nimport sys\n\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2 * 10 ** 6)\n\n\ndef test():\n    pass\n\n```"}]}}

Of course, the round can also have problems with other complexities.\n\nGeorge has a poor imagination.

Complete the given code for the following problem: In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.\n\nThere are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.\n\nOfficer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:\n -  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$; -  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. \nFor example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\n\nThe structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.\n\nFormally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.\n\nBerland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.\n\nSuppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ \u2014 one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.\n\nLet's look at the following example:\n\nIf officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.\n\nIf officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.\n\nTo answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.\n\nYou should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i &lt; i$), where $p_i$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $i$. The commander has index $1$ and doesn't have any superiors.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query is given as a pair ($u_i, k_i$) ($1 \\le u_i, k_i \\le n$), where $u_i$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $k_i$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence..

Complete the given code for the following problem: One particularly well-known fact about zombies is that they move and think terribly slowly. While we still don't know why their movements are so sluggish, the problem of laggy thinking has been recently resolved. It turns out that the reason is not (as previously suspected) any kind of brain defect \u2013 it's the opposite! Independent researchers confirmed that the nervous system of a zombie is highly complicated \u2013 it consists of *n* brains (much like a cow has several stomachs). They are interconnected by brain connectors, which are veins capable of transmitting thoughts between brains. There are two important properties such a brain network should have to function properly: \n 1.  It should be possible to exchange thoughts between any two pairs of brains (perhaps indirectly, through other brains). 1.  There should be no redundant brain connectors, that is, removing any brain connector would make property 1 false. \nIf both properties are satisfied, we say that the nervous system is valid. Unfortunately (?), if the system is not valid, the zombie stops thinking and becomes (even more) dead. Your task is to analyze a given nervous system of a zombie and find out whether it is valid.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000) denoting the number of brains (which are conveniently numbered from 1 to *n*) and the number of brain connectors in the nervous system, respectively.

Unfortunately, not from every city you can reach any other one moving along these roads. Therefore Vasya decided to divide the state into provinces so that in every province, one could reach from every city all the cities of the province, but there are no roads between provinces. \n\nUnlike other turn-based strategies, in FreeDiv a player has the opportunity to build tunnels between cities. The tunnels are two-way roads along which one can move armies undetected by the enemy. However, no more than one tunnel can be connected to each city. As for Vasya, he wants to build a network of tunnels so that any pair of cities in his state were reachable by some path consisting of roads and a tunnels. But at that no more than *k* tunnels are connected to each province (otherwise, the province will be difficult to keep in case other provinces are captured by enemy armies).\n\nVasya discovered that maybe he will not be able to build such a network for the current condition of the state. Maybe he'll have first to build several roads between cities in different provinces to merge the provinces. Your task is to determine the minimum number of roads Vasya needs to build so that it was possible to build the required network of tunnels in the resulting state.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=106,<=0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=106).

By applying it once to a string, he can remove from this string any single character. Bizon Middle knows suffix array well. By applying it once to a string, he can swap any two characters of this string. The guys do not know anything about the suffix tree, but it can help them do much more. \n\nBizon the Champion wonders whether the \"Bizons\" can solve the problem. Perhaps, the solution do not require both data structures. Find out whether the guys can solve the problem and if they can, how do they do it? Can they solve it either only with use of suffix automaton or only with use of suffix array or they need both structures? Note that any structure may be used an unlimited number of times, the structures may be used in any order.\nInput specification: The first line contains a non-empty word *s*.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Astronaut Natasha arrived on Mars. She knows that the Martians are very poor aliens. To ensure a better life for the Mars citizens, their emperor decided to take tax from every tourist who visited the planet. Natasha is the inhabitant of Earth, therefore she had to pay the tax to enter the territory of Mars.\n\nThere are $n$ banknote denominations on Mars: the value of $i$-th banknote is $a_i$. Natasha has an infinite number of banknotes of each denomination.\n\nMartians have $k$ fingers on their hands, so they use a number system with base $k$. In addition, the Martians consider the digit $d$ (in the number system with base $k$) divine. Thus, if the last digit in Natasha's tax amount written in the number system with the base $k$ is $d$, the Martians will be happy. Unfortunately, Natasha does not know the Martians' divine digit yet.\n\nDetermine for which values $d$ Natasha can make the Martians happy.\n\nNatasha can use only her banknotes. Martians don't give her change.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000$, $2 \\le k \\le 100\\,000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of denominations of banknotes and the base of the number system on Mars.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 denominations of banknotes on Mars.\n\nAll numbers are given in decimal notation.. Output specification: On the first line output the number of values $d$ for which Natasha can make the Martians happy.\n\nIn the second line, output all these values in increasing order.\n\nPrint all numbers in decimal notation.\nNote: Consider the first test case.

As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed.

If two trains approach at the same time, Vasya goes toward the direction with the lower frequency of going trains, that is, to the girl, to whose directions the trains go less frequently (see the note to the third sample).\n\nWe know that the trains begin to go simultaneously before Vasya appears. That is the train schedule is such that there exists a moment of time when the two trains arrive simultaneously.\n\nHelp Vasya count to which girlfriend he will go more often.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *a* and *b* (*a*<=\u2260<=*b*,<=1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=106).. Output specification: Print \"Dasha\" if Vasya will go to Dasha more frequently, \"Masha\" if he will go to Masha more frequently, or \"Equal\" if he will go to both girlfriends with the same frequency.\nNote: Let's take a look at the third sample. Let the trains start to go at the zero moment of time. It is clear that the moments of the trains' arrival will be periodic with period 6. That's why it is enough to show that if Vasya descends to the subway at a moment of time inside the interval (0,\u20096], he will go to both girls equally often. \n\nIf he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 0 to 2, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the second minute.\n\nIf he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 2 to 3, he leaves for Masha on the train that arrives by the third minute.\n\nIf he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 3 to 4, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the fourth minute.\n\nIf he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 4 to 6, he waits for both trains to arrive by the sixth minute and goes to Masha as trains go less often in Masha's direction.\n\nIn sum Masha and Dasha get equal time \u2014 three minutes for each one, thus, Vasya will go to both girlfriends equally often.Complete the following code: ```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\r\n    if a == b:\r\n        return a\r\n    \r\n    if a > b:\r\n```"}]}}

He asked his students to implement the Posterization Image Filter.\n\nTheir algorithm will be tested on an array of integers, where the $i$-th integer represents the color of the $i$-th pixel in the image. The image is in black and white, therefore the color of each pixel will be an integer between 0 and 255 (inclusive).\n\nTo implement the filter, students are required to divide the black and white color range [0, 255] into groups of consecutive colors, and select one color in each group to be the group\u2019s key. In order to preserve image details, the size of a group must not be greater than $k$, and each color should belong to exactly one group.\n\nFinally, the students will replace the color of each pixel in the array with that color\u2019s assigned group key.\n\nTo better understand the effect, here is an image of a basking turtle where the Posterization Filter was applied with increasing $k$ to the right. \n\nTo make the process of checking the final answer easier, Professor Ibrahim wants students to divide the groups and assign the keys in a way that produces the lexicographically smallest possible array.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$, $1 \\leq k \\leq 256$), the number of pixels in the image, and the maximum size of a group, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$ ($0 \\leq p_i \\leq 255$), where $p_i$ is the color of the $i$-th pixel..

Complete the given code for the following problem: Little Petya is learning to play chess. He has already learned how to move a king, a rook and a bishop. Let us remind you the rules of moving chess pieces. A chessboard is 64 square fields organized into an 8<=\u00d7<=8 table. A field is represented by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*) \u2014 the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:\n -  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically. -  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally. -  A king moves one field in any direction \u2014 horizontally, vertically or diagonally. \nPetya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2)? At that, we assume that there are no more pieces besides this one on the board. Help him solve this problem.\nInput specification: The input contains four integers *r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2 (1<=\u2264<=*r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2<=\u2264<=8) \u2014 the coordinates of the starting and the final field. The starting field doesn't coincide with the final one.\n\nYou can assume that the chessboard rows are numbered from top to bottom 1 through 8, and the columns are numbered from left to right 1 through 8.. Output specification: Print three space-separated integers: the minimum number of moves the rook, the bishop and the king (in this order) is needed to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2). If a piece cannot make such a move, print a 0 instead of the corresponding number.\nNote: noneComplete the following code: ```python\n\ndef rook(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    if x1 == x2  or y1 == y2 :\n        return 1\n    else :\n        return 2\n\ndef bish(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n```"}]}}

The children find it hard to keep in mind this strange arrangement, and today they formed the line in the following order: *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**n*, which upset Vasya immensely. Now Vasya wants to rearrange the children so that the resulting order is like this: *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. During each move Vasya can swap two people who stand next to each other in the line. Help Vasya, find the sequence of swaps leading to the arrangement Vasya needs. It is not required to minimize the number of moves.\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=300) which is the number of students. The second line contains *n* space-separated integers *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109) which represent the height of the student occupying the *i*-th place must possess. The third line contains *n* space-separated integers *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=109) which represent the height of the student occupying the *i*-th place in the initial arrangement. It is possible that some students possess similar heights. It is guaranteed that it is possible to arrange the children in the required order, i.e. *a* and *b* coincide as multisets.. Output specification: In the first line print an integer *k* (0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=106) which is the number of moves. It is not required to minimize *k* but it must not exceed 106. Then print *k* lines each containing two space-separated integers. Line *p**i*, *p**i*<=+<=1 (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) means that Vasya should swap students occupying places *p**i* and *p**i*<=+<=1.\nNote: noneComplete the following code: ```python\ndef vasya_and_physcult(count, a_str, b_str):\r\n    size = int(count)\r\n    a = list(map(int, a_str.split()))\r\n    b = list(map(int, b_str.split()))\r\n    changes_count = 0\r\n    result = \"\"\r\n```"}]}}

But he can't choose balls with sizes 5, 5 and 6 (two friends would get balls of the same size), and he can't choose balls with sizes 30, 31 and 33 (because sizes 30 and 33 differ by more than 2).\n\nYour task is to check whether Limak can choose three balls that satisfy conditions above.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains one integer *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50)\u00a0\u2014 the number of balls Limak has.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n* (1<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=1000) where *t**i* denotes the size of the *i*-th ball.. Output specification: Print \"YES\" (without quotes) if Limak can choose three balls of distinct sizes, such that any two of them differ by no more than 2. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\nNote: In the first sample, there are 4 balls and Limak is able to choose three of them to satisfy the rules. He must must choose balls with sizes 18, 16 and 17.\n\nIn the second sample, there is no way to give gifts to three friends without breaking the rules.\n\nIn the third sample, there is even more than one way to choose balls:\n 1.  Choose balls with sizes 3, 4 and 5. 1.  Choose balls with sizes 972, 970, 971.Complete the following code: ```python\n#Problema G\ndef insertionSort(arr):\n\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n \n        key = arr[i]\n\n        j = i-1\n```"}]}}

They want to figure out the number that matches by using a communication channel you have access to without revealing it to you.\n\nBoth participants communicated to each other a set of pairs of numbers, that includes the pair given to them. Each pair in the communicated sets comprises two different numbers.\n\nDetermine if you can with certainty deduce the common number, or if you can determine with certainty that both participants know the number but you do not.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 12$) \u2014 the number of pairs the first participant communicated to the second and vice versa.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ pairs of integers, each between $1$ and $9$, \u2014 pairs of numbers communicated from first participant to the second.\n\nThe third line contains $m$ pairs of integers, each between $1$ and $9$, \u2014 pairs of numbers communicated from the second participant to the first.\n\nAll pairs within each set are distinct (in particular, if there is a pair $(1,2)$, there will be no pair $(2,1)$ within the same set), and no pair contains the same number twice.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the two sets do not contradict the statements, in other words, there is pair from the first set and a pair from the second set that share exactly one number..

The park is a rooted tree consisting of *n* vertices with the root at vertex 1. Vertex 1 also contains Kefa's house. Unfortunaely for our hero, the park also contains cats. Kefa has already found out what are the vertices with cats in them.\n\nThe leaf vertices of the park contain restaurants. Kefa wants to choose a restaurant where he will go, but unfortunately he is very afraid of cats, so there is no way he will go to the restaurant if the path from the restaurant to his house contains more than *m* consecutive vertices with cats. \n\nYour task is to help Kefa count the number of restaurants where he can go.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers, *n* and *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of vertices of the tree and the maximum number of consecutive vertices with cats that is still ok for Kefa.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*, where each *a**i* either equals to 0 (then vertex *i* has no cat), or equals to 1 (then vertex *i* has a cat).\n\nNext *n*<=-<=1 lines contains the edges of the tree in the format \"*x**i* *y**i*\" (without the quotes) (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, *x**i*<=\u2260<=*y**i*), where *x**i* and *y**i* are the vertices of the tree, connected by an edge. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the given set of edges specifies a tree..

Suppose Hongcow currently has *A* red cards and *B* blue cards. Then, the *i*-th card will require Hongcow to spend *max*(*r**i*<=-<=*A*,<=0) red tokens, and *max*(*b**i*<=-<=*B*,<=0) blue tokens. Note, only tokens disappear, but the cards stay with Hongcow forever. Each card can be bought only once.\n\nGiven a description of the cards and their costs determine the minimum number of turns Hongcow needs to purchase all cards.\nInput specification: The first line of input will contain a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=16).\n\nThe next *n* lines of input will contain three tokens *c**i*, *r**i* and *b**i*. *c**i* will be 'R' or 'B', denoting the color of the card as red or blue. *r**i* will be an integer denoting the amount of red resources required to obtain the card, and *b**i* will be an integer denoting the amount of blue resources required to obtain the card (0<=\u2264<=*r**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=107).. Output specification: Output a single integer, denoting the minimum number of turns needed to acquire all the cards.\nNote: For the first sample, Hongcow's four moves are as follows: \n 1.  Collect tokens 1.  Buy card 1 1.  Buy card 2 1.  Buy card 3 \nFor the second sample, one optimal strategy is as follows: \n 1.  Collect tokens 1.  Collect tokens 1.  Buy card 2 1.  Collect tokens 1.  Buy card 3 1.  Buy card 1Complete the following code: ```python\nimport math\r\ndef sum_num(n):\r\n\tsum = 0\r\n\tfor i in range(1,n+1):\r\n\t\tsum += i\r\n\treturn sum\r\n\r\ndef edit(l):\r\n```"}]}}

A photographic rifle is obviously for Sharic who loves hunting and fish is for Matroskin, but for whom was a new video game console meant? Every one of the three friends claimed that the present is for him and nearly quarreled. Uncle Fyodor had an idea how to solve the problem justly: they should suppose that the console was sent to all three of them and play it in turns. Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up \u2014 who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that\u2019s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player wins. Otherwise, another game round is required. Write a program that will determine the winner by the gestures they have shown.\nInput specification: The first input line contains the name of the gesture that Uncle Fyodor showed, the second line shows which gesture Matroskin showed and the third line shows Sharic\u2019s gesture..

Nastya removes letters in a certain order (one after another, in this order strictly), which is specified by permutation of letters' indices of the word *t*: *a*1... *a*|*t*|. We denote the length of word *x* as |*x*|. Note that after removing one letter, the indices of other letters don't change. For example, if *t*<==<=\"nastya\" and *a*<==<=[4,<=1,<=5,<=3,<=2,<=6] then removals make the following sequence of words \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\".\n\nSergey knows this permutation. His goal is to stop his sister at some point and continue removing by himself to get the word *p*. Since Nastya likes this activity, Sergey wants to stop her as late as possible. Your task is to determine, how many letters Nastya can remove before she will be stopped by Sergey.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the word *p* can be obtained by removing the letters from word *t*.\nInput specification: The first and second lines of the input contain the words *t* and *p*, respectively. Words are composed of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet (1<=\u2264<=|*p*|<=&lt;<=|*t*|<=\u2264<=200<=000). It is guaranteed that the word *p* can be obtained by removing the letters from word *t*.\n\nNext line contains a permutation *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a*|*t*| of letter indices that specifies the order in which Nastya removes letters of *t* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=|*t*|, all *a**i* are distinct).. Output specification: Print a single integer number, the maximum number of letters that Nastya can remove.\nNote: In the first sample test sequence of removing made by Nastya looks like this:\n\n\"ababcba\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ababcba\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ababcba\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ababcba\" \n\nNastya can not continue, because it is impossible to get word \"abb\" from word \"ababcba\".\n\nSo, Nastya will remove only three letters.Complete the following code: ```python\ns = input()\r\nsmall = input()\r\nnums = [int(x)-1 for x in input().split()]\r\nn = len(s)\r\nlo = 0\r\nans = 0\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.

The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs. Separate the numbers by spaces.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nNote: In the first sample Vasya's approach will make one comparison (it starts with the 1-st element and immediately finds the required number), and Petya's approach makes two comparisons (first he compares with the 2-nd array element, doesn't find the search item and compares with the 1-st element).\n\nIn the second sample, on the contrary, Vasya's approach will need two comparisons (first with 1-st element, and then with the 2-nd), and Petya's approach will find the required value in one comparison (the first comparison with the 2-nd element).Complete the following code: ```python\ndef find(lista,num):\r\n    for i in range(len(lista)):\r\n        if num==lista[i]:\r\n```"}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Complete the given code for the following problem: Imagine that you have a twin brother or sister. Having another person that looks exactly like you seems very unusual. It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.\n\nNow let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins. The second line contains a sequence of *n* integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the coins' values. All numbers are separated with spaces.. Output specification: In the single line print the single number \u2014 the minimum needed number of coins.\nNote: In the first sample you will have to take 2 coins (you and your twin have sums equal to 6,\u20090 correspondingly). If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too. You can pick coins with values 1,\u20092 or 2,\u20092. In any case, the minimum number of coins equals 2.Complete the following code: ```python\ndef minimum_coins_to_take(coins):\n    total_sum = sum(coins)\n    your_sum = 0\n    twin_sum = 0\n    num_coins = 0\n\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: Mad scientist Mike entertains himself by arranging rows of dominoes. He doesn't need dominoes, though: he uses rectangular magnets instead. Each magnet has two poles, positive (a \"plus\") and negative (a \"minus\"). If two magnets are put together at a close distance, then the like poles will repel each other and the opposite poles will attract each other.\n\nMike starts by laying one magnet horizontally on the table. During each following step Mike adds one more magnet horizontally to the right end of the row. Depending on how Mike puts the magnet on the table, it is either attracted to the previous one (forming a group of multiple magnets linked together) or repelled by it (then Mike lays this magnet at some distance to the right from the previous one). We assume that a sole magnet not linked to others forms a group of its own.\n\nMike arranged multiple magnets in a row. Determine the number of groups that the magnets formed.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000) \u2014 the number of magnets.

Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.\n\nCodeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is *x*, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute *m* but made *w* wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is . His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.\n\nAll arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains five space-separated integers *m*1, *m*2, *m*3, *m*4, *m*5, where *m**i* (0<=\u2264<=*m**i*<=\u2264<=119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem *i*. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted.\n\nThe second line contains five space-separated integers *w*1, *w*2, *w*3, *w*4, *w*5, where *w**i* (0<=\u2264<=*w**i*<=\u2264<=10) is Kevin's number of wrong submissions on problem *i*.\n\nThe last line contains two space-separated integers *h**s* and *h**u* (0<=\u2264<=*h**s*,<=*h**u*<=\u2264<=20), denoting the Kevin's numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively.. Output specification: Print a single integer, the value of Kevin's final score.\nNote: In the second sample, Kevin takes 119 minutes on all of the problems. Therefore, he gets <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/42158dc2bc78cd21fa679530ae9ef8b9ea298d15.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> of the points on each problem. So his score from solving problems is <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/fdf392d8508500b57f8057ac0c4c892ab5f925a2.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>. Adding in 10\u00b7100\u2009=\u20091000 points from hacks, his total score becomes 3930\u2009+\u20091000\u2009=\u20094930.Complete the following code: ```python\ndef calc(x, m, w):\r\n    score = max(0.3*x, ((1 - m/250 )*x - 50*w));\r\n    return score;\r\n```"}]}}

In this graph any pair of distinct vertices has an edge between them in both directions. Greg loves playing with the graph and now he has invented a new game:\n -  The game consists of *n* steps. -  On the *i*-th step Greg removes vertex number *x**i* from the graph. As Greg removes a vertex, he also removes all the edges that go in and out of this vertex. -  Before executing each step, Greg wants to know the sum of lengths of the shortest paths between all pairs of the remaining vertices. The shortest path can go through any remaining vertex. In other words, if we assume that *d*(*i*,<=*v*,<=*u*) is the shortest path between vertices *v* and *u* in the graph that formed before deleting vertex *x**i*, then Greg wants to know the value of the following sum: . \nHelp Greg, print the value of the required sum before each step.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=500) \u2014 the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nNext *n* lines contain *n* integers each \u2014 the graph adjacency matrix: the *j*-th number in the *i*-th line *a**ij* (1<=\u2264<=*a**ij*<=\u2264<=105,<=*a**ii*<==<=0) represents the weight of the edge that goes from vertex *i* to vertex *j*.\n\nThe next line contains *n* distinct integers: *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n* (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the vertices that Greg deletes..

Kefa has already found out what are the vertices with cats in them.\n\nThe leaf vertices of the park contain restaurants. Kefa wants to choose a restaurant where he will go, but unfortunately he is very afraid of cats, so there is no way he will go to the restaurant if the path from the restaurant to his house contains more than *m* consecutive vertices with cats. \n\nYour task is to help Kefa count the number of restaurants where he can go.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers, *n* and *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of vertices of the tree and the maximum number of consecutive vertices with cats that is still ok for Kefa.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*, where each *a**i* either equals to 0 (then vertex *i* has no cat), or equals to 1 (then vertex *i* has a cat).\n\nNext *n*<=-<=1 lines contains the edges of the tree in the format \"*x**i* *y**i*\" (without the quotes) (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, *x**i*<=\u2260<=*y**i*), where *x**i* and *y**i* are the vertices of the tree, connected by an edge. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the given set of edges specifies a tree..

Of course, one number can be assigned to any number of customers.\n\n\"Perfect Matching\" wants to advertise its services and publish the number of opposite couples, that is, the couples who have opposite values of *t*. Each couple consists of exactly two clients. The customer can be included in a couple an arbitrary number of times. Help the agency and write the program that will find the sought number by the given sequence *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n*. For example, if *t*<==<=(1,<=<=-<=1,<=1,<=<=-<=1), then any two elements *t**i* and *t**j* form a couple if *i* and *j* have different parity. Consequently, in this case the sought number equals 4.\n\nOf course, a client can't form a couple with him/herself.\nInput specification: The first line of the input data contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) which represents the number of registered clients of the \"Couple Matching\". The second line contains a sequence of integers *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n* (<=-<=10<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=10), *t**i* \u2014 is the parameter of the *i*-th customer that has been assigned to the customer by the result of the analysis of his interests.. Output specification: Print the number of couples of customs with opposite *t*. The opposite number for *x* is number <=-<=*x* (0 is opposite to itself). Couples that only differ in the clients' order are considered the same.\n\nNote that the answer to the problem can be large enough, so you must use the 64-bit integer type for calculations. Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.\nNote: In the first sample the couples of opposite clients are: (1,2), (1,5) \u0438 (3,4).\n\nIn the second sample any couple of clients is opposite.Complete the following code: ```python\nimport collections\r\nimport math\r\nsums = lambda n: int(n * (n + 1) / 2)  # sum from 1 to n\r\nsumsqur = lambda n: int( (n) * (n + 1) * (2*n +1)/6)  # sum square from 1 to n\r\n\r\ndef im(): return map(int, input().split())\r\ndef il(): return list(map(int, input().split()))\r\ndef ii(): return int(input())\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: Limak is a little polar bear. Polar bears hate long strings and thus they like to compress them. You should also know that Limak is so young that he knows only first six letters of the English alphabet: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' and 'f'.\n\nYou are given a set of *q* possible operations. Limak can perform them in any order, any operation may be applied any number of times. The *i*-th operation is described by a string *a**i* of length two and a string *b**i* of length one. No two of *q* possible operations have the same string *a**i*.\n\nWhen Limak has a string *s* he can perform the *i*-th operation on *s* if the first two letters of *s* match a two-letter string *a**i*. Performing the *i*-th operation removes first two letters of *s* and inserts there a string *b**i*. See the notes section for further clarification.\n\nYou may note that performing an operation decreases the length of a string *s* exactly by 1. Also, for some sets of operations there may be a string that cannot be compressed any further, because the first two letters don't match any *a**i*.\n\nLimak wants to start with a string of length *n* and perform *n*<=-<=1 operations to finally get a one-letter string \"a\". In how many ways can he choose the starting string to be able to get \"a\"? Remember that Limak can use only letters he knows.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *q* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=6, 1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=36)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the initial string and the number of available operations.\n\nThe next *q* lines describe the possible operations. The *i*-th of them contains two strings *a**i* and *b**i* (|*a**i*|<==<=2,<=|*b**i*|<==<=1). It's guaranteed that *a**i*<=\u2260<=*a**j* for *i*<=\u2260<=*j* and that all *a**i* and *b**i* consist of only first six lowercase English letters.. Output specification: Print the number of strings of length *n* that Limak will be able to transform to string \"a\" by applying only operations given in the input.\nNote: In the first sample, we count initial strings of length 3 from which Limak can get a required string \"a\". There are 4 such strings: \"abb\", \"cab\", \"cca\", \"eea\". The first one Limak can compress using operation 1 two times (changing \"ab\" to a single \"a\"). The first operation would change \"abb\" to \"ab\" and the second operation would change \"ab\" to \"a\".\n\nOther three strings may be compressed as follows: \n -  \"cab\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ab\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"a\" -  \"cca\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ca\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"a\" -  \"eea\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ca\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"a\" \nIn the second sample, the only correct initial string is \"eb\" because it can be immediately compressed to \"a\".Complete the following code: ```python\nimport collections\r\n\r\nn, q = map(int, input().split())\r\nd = collections.defaultdict(list)\r\ncnt, t = [0] * 6, [0] * 6\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: In this problem you have to implement an algorithm to defragment your hard disk. The hard disk consists of a sequence of clusters, numbered by integers from 1 to *n*. The disk has *m* recorded files, the *i*-th file occupies clusters with numbers *a**i*,<=1, *a**i*,<=2, ..., *a**i*,<=*n**i*. These clusters are not necessarily located consecutively on the disk, but the order in which they are given corresponds to their sequence in the file (cluster *a**i*,<=1 contains the first fragment of the *i*-th file, cluster *a**i*,<=2 has the second fragment, etc.). Also the disc must have one or several clusters which are free from files.\n\nYou are permitted to perform operations of copying the contents of cluster number *i* to cluster number *j* (*i* and *j* must be different). Moreover, if the cluster number *j* used to keep some information, it is lost forever. Clusters are not cleaned, but after the defragmentation is complete, some of them are simply declared unusable (although they may possibly still contain some fragments of files).\n\nYour task is to use a sequence of copy operations to ensure that each file occupies a contiguous area of memory. Each file should occupy a consecutive cluster section, the files must follow one after another from the beginning of the hard disk. After defragmentation all free (unused) clusters should be at the end of the hard disk. After defragmenting files can be placed in an arbitrary order. Clusters of each file should go consecutively from first to last. See explanatory examples in the notes.\n\nPrint the sequence of operations leading to the disk defragmentation.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Vasya is pressing the keys on the keyboard reluctantly, squeezing out his ideas on the classical epos depicted in Homer's Odysseus... How can he explain to his literature teacher that he isn't going to become a writer? In fact, he is going to become a programmer. So, he would take great pleasure in writing a program, but none \u2014 in writing a composition.\n\nAs Vasya was fishing for a sentence in the dark pond of his imagination, he suddenly wondered: what is the least number of times he should push a key to shift the cursor from one position to another one?\n\nLet's describe his question more formally: to type a text, Vasya is using the text editor. He has already written *n* lines, the *i*-th line contains *a**i* characters (including spaces). If some line contains *k* characters, then this line overall contains (*k*<=+<=1) positions where the cursor can stand: before some character or after all characters (at the end of the line). Thus, the cursor's position is determined by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*), where *r* is the number of the line and *c* is the cursor's position in the line (the positions are indexed starting from one from the beginning of the line).\n\nVasya doesn't use the mouse to move the cursor. He uses keys \"Up\", \"Down\", \"Right\" and \"Left\". When he pushes each of these keys, the cursor shifts in the needed direction. Let's assume that before the corresponding key is pressed, the cursor was located in the position (*r*,<=*c*), then Vasya pushed key:\n-  \"Up\": if the cursor was located in the first line (*r*<==<=1), then it does not move. Otherwise, it moves to the previous line (with number *r*<=-<=1), to the same position. At that, if the previous line was short, that is, the cursor couldn't occupy position *c* there, the cursor moves to the last position of the line with number *r*<=-<=1;-  \"Down\": if the cursor was located in the last line (*r*<==<=*n*), then it does not move. Otherwise, it moves to the next line (with number *r*<=+<=1), to the same position. At that, if the next line was short, that is, the cursor couldn't occupy position *c* there, the cursor moves to the last position of the line with number *r*<=+<=1;-  \"Right\": if the cursor can move to the right in this line (*c*<=&lt;<=*a**r*<=+<=1), then it moves to the right (to position *c*<=+<=1). Otherwise, it is located at the end of the line and doesn't move anywhere when Vasya presses the \"Right\" key;-  \"Left\": if the cursor can move to the left in this line (*c*<=&gt;<=1), then it moves to the left (to position *c*<=-<=1). Otherwise, it is located at the beginning of the line and doesn't move anywhere when Vasya presses the \"Left\" key.\nYou've got the number of lines in the text file and the number of characters, written in each line of this file. Find the least number of times Vasya should push the keys, described above, to shift the cursor from position (*r*1,<=*c*1) to position (*r*2,<=*c*2).\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of lines in the file.

Unfortunately, author's solution of the original problem appeared wrong, so the problem was changed specially for the archive.\n\nOnce upon a time in a far away kingdom lived the King. The King had a beautiful daughter, Victoria. They lived happily, but not happily ever after: one day a vicious dragon attacked the kingdom and stole Victoria. The King was full of grief, yet he gathered his noble knights and promised half of his kingdom and Victoria's hand in marriage to the one who will save the girl from the infernal beast.\n\nHaving travelled for some time, the knights found the dragon's lair and all of them rushed there to save Victoria. Each knight spat on the dragon once and, as the dragon had quite a fragile and frail heart, his heart broke and poor beast died. As for the noble knights, they got Victoria right to the King and started brawling as each one wanted the girl's hand in marriage.\n\nThe problem was that all the noble knights were equally noble and equally handsome, and Victoria didn't want to marry any of them anyway. Then the King (and he was a very wise man and didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings) decided to find out who will get his daughter randomly, i.e. tossing a coin. However, there turned out to be *n* noble knights and the coin only has two sides. The good thing is that when a coin is tossed, the coin falls on each side with equal probability. The King got interested how to pick one noble knight using this coin so that all knights had equal probability of being chosen (the probability in that case should always be equal to 1<=/<=*n*). First the King wants to know the expected number of times he will need to toss a coin to determine the winner.

Each resulting part is also a log which can be gnawed in future by any beaver. The beaver that can't make a move loses. Thus, the other beaver wins.\n\nTimur makes the first move. The players play in the optimal way. Determine the winner.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=109).. Output specification: Print \"Timur\", if Timur wins, or \"Marsel\", if Marsel wins. You should print everything without the quotes.\nNote: In the first sample the beavers only have one log, of 15 meters in length. Timur moves first. The only move he can do is to split the log into 3 parts each 5 meters in length. Then Marsel moves but he can't split any of the resulting logs, as *k*\u2009=\u20094. Thus, the winner is Timur.\n\nIn the second example the beavers have 4 logs 9 meters in length. Timur can't split any of them, so that the resulting parts possessed the length of not less than 5 meters, that's why he loses instantly.Complete the following code: ```python\nfrom sys import stdin, stdout\r\n\r\n\r\ndef check(m, k):\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: One day a well-known sponsor of a well-known contest decided to give every participant of the contest a T-shirt as a present. A natural problem occurred: on the one hand, it is not clear how many T-shirts of what sizes should be ordered, and on the other hand, one doesn't want to order too many T-shirts (and we do not exactly paper the walls with the oversupply). After considerable brain racking and some pre-estimating, the sponsor representatives ordered a certain number of T-shirts of sizes S, M, L, XL and XXL. The T-shirts turned out to bring good luck, that's why on the contest day there built up a line of *K* participants willing to get one. Every contestant is characterized by his/her desired T-shirt size (so it happens that for all the participants it is also one of the sizes S, M, L, XL and XXL). The participants come up to get a T-shirt one by one and try to choose the most suitable one, choosing it like this. If there is still a T-shirt of the optimal size left, that he/she takes it without further ado. Otherwise the contestant would prefer to choose a T-shirt with the size as close to the optimal one as possible (the distance between neighboring sizes is considered equal to one). If the variant of choice is not unique, the contestant will take a T-shirt of a bigger size (in case he/she grows more). For example, for a person whose optimal size is L the preference list looks like this: L, XL, M, XXL, S. Using the data on how many T-shirts of every size had been ordered by the organizers, on the size of contestants in the line determine who got a T-shirt of what size.\nInput specification: The first line contains five non-negative integers *N**S*,<=*N**M*,<=*N**L*,<=*N**XL*,<=*N**XXL* not exceeding 1000 which represent the number of T-shirts of the corresponding sizes. The second line contains an integer *K* (1<=\u2264<=*K*<=\u2264<=1000) which represents the number of participants. The next *K* lines contain the optimal T-shirt sizes for the contestants.

The gym where they go is a matrix *a* with *n* lines and *m* columns. Let number *a*[*i*][*j*] represents the calories burned by performing workout at the cell of gym in the *i*-th line and the *j*-th column.\n\nIahub starts with workout located at line 1 and column 1.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Each year in the castle of Dwarven King there is a competition in growing mushrooms among the dwarves. The competition is one of the most prestigious ones, and the winner gets a wooden salad bowl. This year's event brought together the best mushroom growers from around the world, so we had to slightly change the rules so that the event gets more interesting to watch.\n\nEach mushroom grower has a mushroom that he will grow on the competition. Under the new rules, the competition consists of two parts. The first part lasts *t*1 seconds and the second part lasts *t*2 seconds. The first and the second part are separated by a little break.\n\nAfter the starting whistle the first part of the contest starts, and all mushroom growers start growing mushrooms at once, each at his individual speed of *v**i* meters per second. After *t*1 seconds, the mushroom growers stop growing mushrooms and go to have a break. During the break, for unexplained reasons, the growth of all mushrooms is reduced by *k* percent. After the break the second part of the contest starts and all mushrooms growers at the same time continue to grow mushrooms, each at his individual speed of *u**i* meters per second. After a *t*2 seconds after the end of the break, the competition ends. Note that the speeds before and after the break may vary.\n\nBefore the match dwarf Pasha learned from all participants, what two speeds they have chosen. However, the participants did not want to disclose to him all their strategy and therefore, did not say in what order they will be using these speeds. That is, if a participant chose speeds *a**i* and *b**i*, then there are two strategies: he either uses speed *a**i* before the break and speed *b**i* after it, or vice versa.\n\nDwarf Pasha really wants to win the totalizer. He knows that each participant chooses the strategy that maximizes the height of the mushroom. Help Dwarf Pasha make the final table of competition results.\n\nThe participants are sorted in the result table by the mushroom height (the participants with higher mushrooms follow earlier in the table).

The first character of the slogan must be in the first square (the leftmost) of the poster, the second character must be in the second square, and so on.\n\nOf course, the R1 programmers want to write the slogan on the poster themselves. To do this, they have a large (and a very heavy) ladder which was put exactly opposite the *k*-th square of the poster. To draw the *i*-th character of the slogan on the poster, you need to climb the ladder, standing in front of the *i*-th square of the poster. This action (along with climbing up and down the ladder) takes one hour for a painter. The painter is not allowed to draw characters in the adjacent squares when the ladder is in front of the *i*-th square because the uncomfortable position of the ladder may make the characters untidy.

There are *n* houses in that village, lining in a straight line from left to right: house 1, house 2, ..., house *n*. The village is also well-structured: house *i* and house *i*<=+<=1 (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*n*) are exactly 10 meters away. In this village, some houses are occupied, and some are not. Indeed, unoccupied houses can be purchased.\n\nYou will be given *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* that denote the availability and the prices of the houses. If house *i* is occupied, and therefore cannot be bought, then *a**i* equals 0. Otherwise, house *i* can be bought, and *a**i* represents the money required to buy it, in dollars.\n\nAs Zane has only *k* dollars to spare, it becomes a challenge for him to choose the house to purchase, so that he could live as near as possible to his crush.

Complete the given code for the following problem: A dice is a cube, its faces contain distinct integers from 1 to 6 as black points. The sum of numbers at the opposite dice faces always equals 7. Please note that there are only two dice (these dices are mirror of each other) that satisfy the given constraints (both of them are shown on the picture on the left).\n\nAlice and Bob play dice. Alice has built a tower from *n* dice. We know that in this tower the adjacent dice contact with faces with distinct numbers. Bob wants to uniquely identify the numbers written on the faces of all dice, from which the tower is built. Unfortunately, Bob is looking at the tower from the face, and so he does not see all the numbers on the faces. Bob sees the number on the top of the tower and the numbers on the two adjacent sides (on the right side of the picture shown what Bob sees).\n\nHelp Bob, tell whether it is possible to uniquely identify the numbers on the faces of all the dice in the tower, or not.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of dice in the tower.\n\nThe second line contains an integer *x* (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=6) \u2014 the number Bob sees at the top of the tower.

That is, the topmost dice has index 1 (the dice whose top face Bob can see). It is guaranteed that it is possible to make a dice tower that will look as described in the input.. Output specification: Print \"YES\" (without the quotes), if it is possible to to uniquely identify the numbers on the faces of all the dice in the tower.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Ilya is working for the company that constructs robots. Ilya writes programs for entertainment robots, and his current project is \"Bob\", a new-generation game robot. Ilya's boss wants to know his progress so far. Especially he is interested if Bob is better at playing different games than the previous model, \"Alice\". \n\nSo now Ilya wants to compare his robots' performance in a simple game called \"1-2-3\". This game is similar to the \"Rock-Paper-Scissors\" game: both robots secretly choose a number from the set {1,<=2,<=3} and say it at the same moment. If both robots choose the same number, then it's a draw and noone gets any points. But if chosen numbers are different, then one of the robots gets a point: 3 beats 2, 2 beats 1 and 1 beats 3. \n\nBoth robots' programs make them choose their numbers in such a way that their choice in (*i*<=+<=1)-th game depends only on the numbers chosen by them in *i*-th game. \n\nIlya knows that the robots will play *k* games, Alice will choose number *a* in the first game, and Bob will choose *b* in the first game. He also knows both robots' programs and can tell what each robot will choose depending on their choices in previous game. Ilya doesn't want to wait until robots play all *k* games, so he asks you to predict the number of points they will have after the final game.\nInput specification: The first line contains three numbers *k*, *a*, *b* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=1018, 1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=3). \n\nThen 3 lines follow, *i*-th of them containing 3 numbers *A**i*,<=1, *A**i*,<=2, *A**i*,<=3, where *A**i*,<=*j* represents Alice's choice in the game if Alice chose *i* in previous game and Bob chose *j* (1<=\u2264<=*A**i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=3). \n\nThen 3 lines follow, *i*-th of them containing 3 numbers *B**i*,<=1, *B**i*,<=2, *B**i*,<=3, where *B**i*,<=*j* represents Bob's choice in the game if Alice chose *i* in previous game and Bob chose *j* (1<=\u2264<=*B**i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=3).. Output specification: Print two numbers. First of them has to be equal to the number of points Alice will have, and second of them must be Bob's score after *k* games.\nNote: In the second example game goes like this:\n\n<img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/1e21b6e200707470571d69c9946ace6b56f5279b.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\nThe fourth and the seventh game are won by Bob, the first game is draw and the rest are won by Alice.Complete the following code: ```python\nk, a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split(\" \")]\nA = []\nB = []\nap = 0\nbp = 0\nac = a\nbc = b\nah = []\n```"}]}}

Petya has *n* different souvenirs to sell; *i*th souvenir is characterised by its weight *w**i* and cost *c**i*. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than *m*, and total cost is maximum possible.\n\nHelp Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=300000) \u2014 the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.\n\nThen *n* lines follow. *i*th line contains two integers *w**i* and *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*w**i*<=\u2264<=3, 1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the weight and the cost of *i*th souvenir..

Dot chose Transylvania as the most mysterious and unpredictable place.\n\nBut to their great regret, the leave turned to be very short, so it will be enough to visit one of the three above named places. That's why Yakko, as the cleverest, came up with a truly genius idea: let each of the three roll an ordinary six-sided die, and the one with the highest amount of points will be the winner, and will take the other two to the place of his/her dreams.\n\nYakko thrown a die and got Y points, Wakko \u2014 W points.

Go 1 unit towards the positive direction, denoted as '+' 1.  Go 1 unit towards the negative direction, denoted as '-' \nBut the Wi-Fi condition is so poor that Dreamoon's smartphone reports some of the commands can't be recognized and Dreamoon knows that some of them might even be wrong though successfully recognized. Dreamoon decides to follow every recognized command and toss a fair coin to decide those unrecognized ones (that means, he moves to the 1 unit to the negative or positive direction with the same probability 0.5). \n\nYou are given an original list of commands sent by Drazil and list received by Dreamoon.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Masha really loves algebra. On the last lesson, her strict teacher Dvastan gave she new exercise.\n\nYou are given geometric progression *b* defined by two integers *b*1 and *q*. Remind that a geometric progression is a sequence of integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=*b*3,<=..., where for each *i*<=&gt;<=1 the respective term satisfies the condition *b**i*<==<=*b**i*<=-<=1\u00b7*q*, where *q* is called the common ratio of the progression. Progressions in Uzhlyandia are unusual: both *b*1 and *q* can equal 0. Also, Dvastan gave Masha *m* \"bad\" integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**m*, and an integer *l*.\n\nMasha writes all progression terms one by one onto the board (including repetitive) while condition |*b**i*|<=\u2264<=*l* is satisfied (|*x*| means absolute value of *x*). There is an exception: if a term equals one of the \"bad\" integers, Masha skips it (doesn't write onto the board) and moves forward to the next term.\n\nBut the lesson is going to end soon, so Masha has to calculate how many integers will be written on the board. In order not to get into depression, Masha asked you for help: help her calculate how many numbers she will write, or print \"inf\" in case she needs to write infinitely many integers.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains four integers *b*1, *q*, *l*, *m* (-109<=\u2264<=*b*1,<=*q*<=\u2264<=109, 1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=109, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the initial term and the common ratio of progression, absolute value of maximal number that can be written on the board and the number of \"bad\" integers, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains *m* distinct integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**m* (-109<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 numbers that will never be written on the board.. Output specification: Print the only integer, meaning the number of progression terms that will be written on the board if it is finite, or \"inf\" (without quotes) otherwise.\nNote: In the first sample case, Masha will write integers 3,\u200912,\u200924. Progression term 6 will be skipped because it is a \"bad\" integer. Terms bigger than 24 won't be written because they exceed *l* by absolute value.\n\nIn the second case, Masha won't write any number because all terms are equal 123 and this is a \"bad\" integer.\n\nIn the third case, Masha will write infinitely integers 123.Complete the following code: ```python\ndef main():\r\n    b1, q, l, m = map(int, input().split())\r\n    a = set(map(int, input().split()))\r\n\r\n    if b1 == 0:\r\n        if 0 in a:\r\n            return 0\r\n        else:\r\n```"}]}}

He likes to guess the greatest common divisor (gcd) of different segments of the array. Of course, sometimes the guess is not correct. However, Bash will be satisfied if his guess is almost correct.\n\nSuppose he guesses that the gcd of the elements in the range [*l*,<=*r*] of *a* is *x*. He considers the guess to be almost correct if he can change at most one element in the segment such that the gcd of the segment is *x* after making the change. Note that when he guesses, he doesn't actually change the array \u2014 he just wonders if the gcd of the segment can be made *x*. Apart from this, he also sometimes makes changes to the array itself.\n\nSince he can't figure it out himself, Bash wants you to tell him which of his guesses are almost correct. Formally, you have to process *q* queries of one of the following forms:\n -  1<=*l*<=*r*<=*x* \u2014 Bash guesses that the gcd of the range [*l*,<=*r*] is *x*.

Complete the given code for the following problem: A company has *n* employees numbered from 1 to *n*. Each employee either has no immediate manager or exactly one immediate manager, who is another employee with a different number. An employee *A* is said to be the superior of another employee *B* if at least one of the following is true:\n -  Employee *A* is the immediate manager of employee *B* -  Employee *B* has an immediate manager employee *C* such that employee *A* is the superior of employee *C*. \nThe company will not have a managerial cycle. That is, there will not exist an employee who is the superior of his/her own immediate manager.\n\nToday the company is going to arrange a party. This involves dividing all *n* employees into several groups: every employee must belong to exactly one group. Furthermore, within any single group, there must not be two employees *A* and *B* such that *A* is the superior of *B*.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of groups that must be formed?\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2000) \u2014 the number of employees.\n\nThe next *n* lines contain the integers *p**i* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=*n* or *p**i*<==<=-1). Every *p**i* denotes the immediate manager for the *i*-th employee. If *p**i* is -1, that means that the *i*-th employee does not have an immediate manager. \n\nIt is guaranteed, that no employee will be the immediate manager of him/herself (*p**i*<=\u2260<=*i*). Also, there will be no managerial cycles..

Complete the given code for the following problem: You want to arrange *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* in some order in a row. Let's define the value of an arrangement as the sum of differences between all pairs of adjacent integers.\n\nMore formally, let's denote some arrangement as a sequence of integers *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n*, where sequence *x* is a permutation of sequence *a*. The value of such an arrangement is (*x*1<=-<=*x*2)<=+<=(*x*2<=-<=*x*3)<=+<=...<=+<=(*x**n*<=-<=1<=-<=*x**n*).\n\nFind the largest possible value of an arrangement.

Sequence *x* should be the lexicographically smallest permutation of *a* that corresponds to an arrangement of the largest possible value.\nNote: In the sample test case, the value of the output arrangement is (100\u2009-\u2009(\u2009-\u200950))\u2009+\u2009((\u2009-\u200950)\u2009-\u20090)\u2009+\u2009(0\u2009-\u200950)\u2009+\u2009(50\u2009-\u2009(\u2009-\u2009100))\u2009=\u2009200.
