After completing a level, you may decide to either continue the game and play the next level, or reset the game and start again from the first level. Both the decision and the action are instant.\n\nYour goal is to complete all the levels sequentially in at most *R* total seconds.

Each query is a range from *low* to *high* and you have to answer each query.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *a* and *b*, the two integers as described above (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=109). The second line contains one integer *n*, the number of queries (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=104). Then *n* lines follow, each line contains one query consisting of two integers, *low* and *high* (1<=\u2264<=*low*<=\u2264<=*high*<=\u2264<=109).. Output specification: Print *n* lines. The *i*-th of them should contain the result of the *i*-th query in the input. If there is no common divisor in the given range for any query, you should print -1 as a result for this query.\nDemo input: ['9 27\\n3\\n1 5\\n10 11\\n9 11\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n-1\\n9\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

He visits a canteen every day and he has already decided what he will order in each of the following *n* days. Prices in the canteen do not change and that means Arseny will spend *c**i* rubles during the *i*-th day.\n\nThere are 1-ruble coins and 100-ruble notes in circulation. At this moment, Arseny has *m* coins and a sufficiently large amount of notes (you can assume that he has an infinite amount of them). Arseny loves modern technologies, so he uses his credit card everywhere except the canteen, but he has to pay in cash in the canteen because it does not accept cards.\n\nCashier always asks the student to pay change-free. However, it's not always possible, but Arseny tries to minimize the dissatisfaction of the cashier. Cashier's dissatisfaction for each of the days is determined by the total amount of notes and coins in the change. To be precise, if the cashier gives Arseny *x* notes and coins on the *i*-th day, his dissatisfaction for this day equals *x*\u00b7*w**i*. Cashier always gives change using as little coins and notes as possible, he always has enough of them to be able to do this.\n\nArseny wants to pay in such a way that the total dissatisfaction of the cashier for *n* days would be as small as possible.

Each description is a map of an *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* checkered rectangular field. Some cells of the field contain candies (each cell has at most one candy). An empty cell is denoted as \".\" on the map, but if a cell has a candy, it is denoted as a letter of the English alphabet.

The levels can be transmitted in any order. There are two ways to transmit the current level *A*:\n 1.  You can transmit the whole level *A*. Then you need to transmit *n*\u00b7*m* bytes via the network. 1.  You can transmit the difference between level *A* and some previously transmitted level *B* (if it exists); this operation requires to transmit *d**A*,<=*B*\u00b7*w* bytes, where *d**A*,<=*B* is the number of cells of the field that are different for *A* and *B*, and *w* is a constant.

He even can't stay close to those trees.\n\nIf the two trees Drazil chooses are *x*-th and *y*-th, we can estimate the energy the morning run takes to him as 2(*h**x*<=+<=*h**y*)<=+<=*dist*(*x*,<=*y*). Since there are children on exactly one of two arcs connecting *x* and *y*, the distance *dist*(*x*,<=*y*) between trees *x* and *y* is uniquely defined.\n\nNow, you know that on the *i*-th day children play between *a**i*-th tree and *b**i*-th tree. More formally, if *a**i*<=\u2264<=*b**i*, children play around the trees with indices from range [*a**i*,<=*b**i*], otherwise they play around the trees with indices from .\n\nPlease help Drazil to determine which two trees he should choose in order to consume the most energy (since he wants to become fit and cool-looking monkey) and report the resulting amount of energy for each day.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integer *n* and *m* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105), denoting number of trees and number of days, respectively. \n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *d*1,<=*d*2,<=...,<=*d**n* (1<=\u2264<=*d**i*<=\u2264<=109), the distances between consecutive trees.\n\nThe third line contains *n* integers *h*1,<=*h*2,<=...,<=*h**n* (1<=\u2264<=*h**i*<=\u2264<=109), the heights of trees.\n\nEach of following *m* lines contains two integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) describing each new day. There are always at least two different trees Drazil can choose that are not affected by children.. Output specification: For each day print the answer in a separate line.\nDemo input: ['5 3\\n2 2 2 2 2\\n3 5 2 1 4\\n1 3\\n2 2\\n4 5\\n', '3 3\\n5 1 4\\n5 1 4\\n3 3\\n2 2\\n1 1\\n'], Demo output: ['12\\n16\\n18\\n', '17\\n22\\n11\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Alice wants to send an important message to Bob. Message *a*<==<=(*a*1,<=...,<=*a**n*) is a sequence of positive integers (characters).\n\nTo compress the message Alice wants to use binary Huffman coding. We recall that binary Huffman code, or binary prefix code is a function *f*, that maps each letter that appears in the string to some binary string (that is, string consisting of characters '0' and '1' only) such that for each pair of different characters *a**i* and *a**j* string *f*(*a**i*) is not a prefix of *f*(*a**j*) (and vice versa). The result of the encoding of the message *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* is the concatenation of the encoding of each character, that is the string *f*(*a*1)*f*(*a*2)... *f*(*a**n*). Huffman codes are very useful, as the compressed message can be easily and uniquely decompressed, if the function *f* is given. Code is usually chosen in order to minimize the total length of the compressed message, i.e. the length of the string *f*(*a*1)*f*(*a*2)... *f*(*a**n*).\n\nBecause of security issues Alice doesn't want to send the whole message. Instead, she picks some substrings of the message and wants to send them separately. For each of the given substrings *a**l**i*... *a**r**i* she wants to know the minimum possible length of the Huffman coding. Help her solve this problem.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains the single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the initial message. The second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 characters of the message.\n\nNext line contains the single integer *q* (1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of queries.\n\nThen follow *q* lines with queries descriptions. The *i*-th of these lines contains two integers *l**i* and *r**i* (1<=\u2264<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the position of the left and right ends of the *i*-th substring respectively. Positions are numbered from 1. Substrings may overlap in any way. The same substring may appear in the input more than once.. Output specification: Print *q* lines. Each line should contain a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible length of the Huffman encoding of the substring *a**l**i*... *a**r**i*.\nDemo input: ['7\\n1 2 1 3 1 2 1\\n5\\n1 7\\n1 3\\n3 5\\n2 4\\n4 4\\n'], Demo output: ['10\\n3\\n3\\n5\\n0\\n']\nNote: In the first query, one of the optimal ways to encode the substring is to map 1 to \"0\", 2 to \"10\" and 3 to \"11\".\n\nNote that it is correct to map the letter to the empty substring (as in the fifth query from the sample)."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: After the contest in comparing numbers, Shapur's teacher found out that he is a real genius and that no one could possibly do the calculations faster than him even using a super computer!\n\nSome days before the contest, the teacher took a very simple-looking exam and all his *n* students took part in the exam. The teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation.\n\nUnfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.\n\nNow the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers.\n\nShapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: \n -  As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. -  As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include \"-\", \";\" and \"_\". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. -  The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600 -  My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. -  Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN -  You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong. Do this by writing \"WA\" for Wrong answer or \"ACC\" for a correct answer. -  I should remind you that none of the strings (initial strings or answers) are empty. -  Finally, do these as soon as possible. You have less than 2 hours to complete this.\nInput specification: The first three lines contain a string each. These are the initial strings. They consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). All the initial strings have length from 1 to 100, inclusively.\n\nIn the fourth line there is a single integer *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000), the number of students.\n\nNext *n* lines contain a student's answer each. It is guaranteed that the answer meets what the teacher said. Each answer iconsists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). Length is from 1 to 600, inclusively.. Output specification: For each student write in a different line. Print \"WA\" if his answer is wrong or \"ACC\" if his answer is OK.\nDemo input: ['Iran_\\nPersian;\\nW_o;n;d;e;r;f;u;l;\\n7\\nWonderfulPersianIran\\nwonderful_PersIAN_IRAN;;_\\nWONDERFUL___IRAN__PERSIAN__;;\\nIra__Persiann__Wonderful\\nWonder;;fulPersian___;I;r;a;n;\\n__________IranPersianWonderful__________\\nPersianIran_is_Wonderful\\n', 'Shapur;;\\nis___\\na_genius\\n3\\nShapur__a_is___geniUs\\nis___shapur___a__Genius;\\nShapur;;is;;a;;geni;;us;;\\n'], Demo output: ['ACC\\nACC\\nACC\\nWA\\nACC\\nACC\\nWA\\n', 'WA\\nACC\\nACC\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Each day exactly one snack fell onto the city, but their order was strange. So, at some days the residents weren't able to put the new stack on the top of the Snacktower: they had to wait until all the bigger snacks fell.

To carry out his plan, Qwerty is going to take a bank loan that covers all expenses and to return the loaned money at the end of the operation (the money is returned without the interest). At the same time, Querty wants to get as much profit as possible.\n\nThe system has *n* planets in total.

Write a python script for the following problem: The History of Magic is perhaps the most boring subject in the Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry Potter is usually asleep during history lessons, and his magical quill writes the lectures for him. Professor Binns, the history of magic teacher, lectures in such a boring and monotonous voice, that he has a soporific effect even on the quill. That's why the quill often makes mistakes, especially in dates.\n\nSo, at the end of the semester Professor Binns decided to collect the students' parchments with notes and check them. Ron Weasley is in a panic: Harry's notes may contain errors, but at least he has some notes, whereas Ron does not have any. Ronald also has been sleeping during the lectures and his quill had been eaten by his rat Scabbers. Hermione Granger refused to give Ron her notes, because, in her opinion, everyone should learn on their own. Therefore, Ron has no choice but to copy Harry's notes.\n\nDue to the quill's errors Harry's dates are absolutely confused: the years of goblin rebellions and other important events for the wizarding world do not follow in order, and sometimes even dates from the future occur. Now Ron wants to change some of the digits while he copies the notes so that the dates were in the chronological (i.e. non-decreasing) order and so that the notes did not have any dates strictly later than 2011, or strictly before than 1000. To make the resulting sequence as close as possible to the one dictated by Professor Binns, Ron will change no more than one digit in each date into other digit. Help him do it.\nInput specification: The first input line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000). It represents the number of dates in Harry's notes. Next *n* lines contain the actual dates *y*1, *y*2, ..., *y**n*, each line contains a date. Each date is a four-digit integer (1000<=\u2264<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=9999)..

Numbers *z**i* must form the non-decreasing sequence. Each number *z**i* should differ from the corresponding date *y**i* in no more than one digit.

Of course, this is not exactly what Polycarp needs, but he's got to start from something! \n\nHelp Polycarp and write the main plug-in module. Your program should remove from a string all pairs of identical letters, which are consecutive. If after the removal there appear new pairs, the program should remove them as well.

Write a python script for the following problem: Merge sort is a well-known sorting algorithm. The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:\n 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=\u2264<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* \u2014 *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\nInput specification: The first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it..

He's been working there for a long time and is satisfied with his job, as it allows him to eat out in the best restaurants and order the most expensive and exotic wood types there. \n\nThe content special agent has got an important task: to get the latest research by British scientists on the English Language. These developments are encoded and stored in a large safe. The Beaver's teeth are strong enough, so the authorities assured that upon arriving at the place the beaver won't have any problems with opening the safe.\n\nAnd he finishes his aspen sprig and leaves for this important task. Of course, the Beaver arrived at the location without any problems, but alas. He can't open the safe with his strong and big teeth. At this point, the Smart Beaver get a call from the headquarters and learns that opening the safe with the teeth is not necessary, as a reliable source has sent the following information: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. There also is a special hint, which can be used to open the safe. The hint is string *s* with the following structure:\n -  if *s**i* = \"?\", then the digit that goes *i*-th in the safe code can be anything (between 0 to 9, inclusively); -  if *s**i* is a digit (between 0 to 9, inclusively), then it means that there is digit *s**i* on position *i* in code; -  if the string contains letters from \"A\" to \"J\", then all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits and the positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits. -  The length of the safe code coincides with the length of the hint. \nFor example, hint \"?JGJ9\" has such matching safe code variants: \"51919\", \"55959\", \"12329\", \"93539\" and so on, and has wrong variants such as: \"56669\", \"00111\", \"03539\" and \"13666\".\n\nAfter receiving such information, the authorities change the plan and ask the special agents to work quietly and gently and not to try to open the safe by mechanical means, and try to find the password using the given hint.\n\nAt a special agent school the Smart Beaver was the fastest in his platoon finding codes for such safes, but now he is not in that shape: the years take their toll ...

Write a python script for the following problem: It's May in Flatland, and there are $m$ days in this month. Despite the fact that May Holidays are canceled long time ago, employees of some software company still have a habit of taking short or long vacations in May.\n\nOf course, not all managers of the company like this. There are $n$ employees in the company that form a tree-like structure of subordination: each employee has a unique integer id $i$ between $1$ and $n$, and each employee with id $i$ (except the head manager whose id is 1) has exactly one direct manager with id $p_i$. The structure of subordination is not cyclic, i.e. if we start moving from any employee to his direct manager, then we will eventually reach the head manager. We define that an employee $u$ is a subordinate of an employee $v$, if $v$ is a direct manager of $u$, or the direct manager of $u$ is a subordinate of $v$. Let $s_i$ be the number of subordinates the $i$-th employee has (for example, $s_1 = n - 1$, because all employees except himself are subordinates of the head manager).\n\nEach employee $i$ has a bearing limit of $t_i$, which is an integer between $0$ and $s_i$. It denotes the maximum number of the subordinates of the $i$-th employee being on vacation at the same moment that he can bear. If at some moment strictly more than $t_i$ subordinates of the $i$-th employee are on vacation, and the $i$-th employee himself is not on a vacation, he becomes displeased.\n\nIn each of the $m$ days of May exactly one event of the following two types happens: either one employee leaves on a vacation at the beginning of the day, or one employee returns from a vacation in the beginning of the day. You know the sequence of events in the following $m$ days. Your task is to compute for each of the $m$ days the number of displeased employees on that day.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$) \u2014 the number of employees in the company and the number of days in May.\n\nThe second line contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \\ldots, p_n$ ($1 \\leq p_i \\leq n$), denoting the direct managers of employees.\n\nThe third line contains $n$ integers $t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_n$ ($0 \\leq t_i \\leq s_i$), denoting the bearing limits of empoyees.\n\nThe fourth line contains $m$ integers $q_1, q_2, \\ldots, q_m$ ($1 \\leq |q_i| \\leq n$, $q_i \\ne 0$), denoting the events. If $q_i$ is positive, then the employee with id $q_i$ leaves for a vacation starting from this day, if $q_i$ is negative, then the employee $-q_i$ returns from a vacation starting from this day. In the beginning of May no employee is on vacation. It is guaranteed that if some employee leaves for a vacation, he is not on a vacation at the moment and vice versa..

At the fourth day employee with id 5 becomes displeased as his last remaining employee with id 7 leaves for a vacation. At the fifth day employee with id 2 returns from the vacation, but it does not affect the number of displeased employees as the employees 5 and 1 are still displeased. At the sixth day employee with id 3 returns back from the vacation, preventing the employee with id 5 from being displeased and at the last day the head manager with id 1 leaves for a vacation, leaving the company without the displeased people at all."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Natasha is going to fly on a rocket to Mars and return to Earth. Also, on the way to Mars, she will land on $n - 2$ intermediate planets. Formally: we number all the planets from $1$ to $n$. $1$ is Earth, $n$ is Mars. Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt. Assume, that the rocket takes off and lands instantly.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 number of planets.\n\nThe second line contains the only integer $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 weight of the payload.\n\nThe third line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$), where $a_i$ is the number of tons, which can be lifted off by one ton of fuel.\n\nThe fourth line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le 1000$), where $b_i$ is the number of tons, which can be landed by one ton of fuel. \n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel.. Output specification: If Natasha can fly to Mars through $(n - 2)$ planets and return to Earth, print the minimum mass of fuel (in tons) that Natasha should take. Otherwise, print a single number $-1$.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel.\n\nThe answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $10^{-6}$. Formally, let your answer be $p$, and the jury's answer be $q$. Your answer is considered correct if $\\frac{|p - q|}{\\max{(1, |q|)}} \\le 10^{-6}$.\nDemo input: ['2\\n12\\n11 8\\n7 5\\n', '3\\n1\\n1 4 1\\n2 5 3\\n', '6\\n2\\n4 6 3 3 5 6\\n2 6 3 6 5 3\\n'], Demo output: ['10.0000000000\\n', '-1\\n', '85.4800000000\\n']\nNote: Let's consider the first example.\n\nInitially, the mass of a rocket with fuel is $22$ tons.\n-  At take-off from Earth one ton of fuel can lift off $11$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $22$ tons you need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons.-  During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining.-  While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. There will be $14$ tons of rocket with fuel after that.-  During landing on Earth, one ton of fuel can land $7$ tons of cargo, so for landing $14$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight is $12$ tons, that is, a rocket without any fuel.\nIn the second case, the rocket will not be able even to take off from Earth."}]}}

That's why a question arises: \"Which integer type to use if one wants to store a positive integer *n*?\"\n\nPetya knows only 5 integer types:\n\n1) byte occupies 1 byte and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=128 to 127\n\n2) short occupies 2 bytes and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=32768 to 32767\n\n3) int occupies 4 bytes and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=2147483648 to 2147483647\n\n4) long occupies 8 bytes and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807\n\n5) BigInteger can store any integer number, but at that it is not a primitive type, and operations with it are much slower.\n\nFor all the types given above the boundary values are included in the value range.\n\nFrom this list, Petya wants to choose the smallest type that can store a positive integer *n*.

It consists of no more than 100 digits and doesn't contain any leading zeros. The number *n* can't be represented as an empty string.\n\nPlease, do not use %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use cout (also you may use %I64d)..

Write a python script for the following problem: There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: \n -  alloc n \u2014 to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; \nThe memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.\n\nThe first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.\nInput specification: The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100;1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *t* \u2014 the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* \u2014 the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.. Output specification: Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession. Output lines should go in the same order in which the operations are processed.

The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:\n 1.

Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* \u2014 *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\nInput specification: The first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it..

One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are \"relaxing\".\n\nFor a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap).\n\nIt turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again. \n\nUnhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her. For sure, the shark couldn't say no to her favourite meal, but she had no desire to go back to the dentist. That's why she decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that the viability of no tooth becomes negative. \n\nAs Valerie is not good at mathematics, she asked you to help her to find out the total amount of crucians that she can consume for dinner.\n\nWe should remind you that while eating one crucian Valerie uses exactly one row of teeth and the viability of each tooth from this row decreases by one.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000,<=0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 total amount of Valerie's teeth, amount of tooth rows and amount of crucians in Valerie's portion for dinner.

Two incredible outbursts then arrived, each with *n* meteorids, colours of which being integer sequences *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* and *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**n* respectively.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the elements of array. \n\nThe third line contains integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs. Separate the numbers by spaces.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++.

The man started to call for the little mermaid to appear but alas, he only woke up Cthulhu...\n\nWhereas on the other end of the world Pentagon is actively collecting information trying to predict the monster's behavior and preparing the secret super weapon. Due to high seismic activity and poor weather conditions the satellites haven't yet been able to make clear shots of the monster. The analysis of the first shot resulted in an undirected graph with *n* vertices and *m* edges. Now the world's best minds are about to determine whether this graph can be regarded as Cthulhu or not.\n\nTo add simplicity, let's suppose that Cthulhu looks from the space like some spherical body with tentacles attached to it. Formally, we shall regard as Cthulhu such an undirected graph that can be represented as a set of three or more rooted trees, whose roots are connected by a simple cycle.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the graph contains no multiple edges and self-loops.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers \u2014 the number of vertices *n* and the number of edges *m* of the graph (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100, 0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=).\n\nEach of the following *m* lines contains a pair of integers *x* and *y*, that show that an edge exists between vertices *x* and *y* (1<=\u2264<=*x*,<=*y*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*x*<=\u2260<=*y*). For each pair of vertices there will be at most one edge between them, no edge connects a vertex to itself.. Output specification: Print \"NO\", if the graph is not Cthulhu and \"FHTAGN!\" if it is.\nDemo input: ['6 6\\n6 3\\n6 4\\n5 1\\n2 5\\n1 4\\n5 4\\n', '6 5\\n5 6\\n4 6\\n3 1\\n5 1\\n1 2\\n'], Demo output: ['FHTAGN!', 'NO']\nNote: Let us denote as a simple cycle a set of *v* vertices that can be numbered so that the edges will only exist between vertices number 1 and 2, 2 and 3, ..., *v*\u2009-\u20091 and *v*, *v* and 1.\n\nA tree is a connected undirected graph consisting of *n* vertices and *n*\u2009-\u20091 edges (*n*\u2009&gt;\u20090).\n\nA rooted tree is a tree where one vertex is selected to be the root."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective. You are able to cope with it not worse, aren't you?\nInput specification: The first and single line contains two integers *A* and *B* (1<=\u2264<=*A*,<=*B*<=\u2264<=109,<=*min*(*A*,<=*B*)<=\u2264<=12).. Output specification: Print a single integer denoting the greatest common divisor of integers *A*! and *B*!.\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n'], Demo output: ['6\\n']\nNote: Consider the sample.\n\n4!\u2009=\u20091\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74\u2009=\u200924. 3!\u2009=\u20091\u00b72\u00b73\u2009=\u20096.

The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.\nInput specification: The first (and the only) input line contains integer number *w* (1<=\u2264<=*w*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.. Output specification: Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.\nDemo input: ['8\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n']\nNote: For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant \u2014 two parts of 4 and 4 kilos)."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Today Sonya learned about long integers and invited all her friends to share the fun. Sonya has an initially empty multiset with integers. Friends give her *t* queries, each of one of the following type:\n 1.  <=+<= *a**i*\u00a0\u2014 add non-negative integer *a**i* to the multiset. Note, that she has a multiset, thus there may be many occurrences of the same integer. 1.  <=-<= *a**i*\u00a0\u2014 delete a single occurrence of non-negative integer *a**i* from the multiset. It's guaranteed, that there is at least one *a**i* in the multiset. 1.  ? *s*\u00a0\u2014 count the number of integers in the multiset (with repetitions) that match some pattern *s* consisting of 0 and 1. In the pattern, 0 stands for the even digits, while 1 stands for the odd. Integer *x* matches the pattern *s*, if the parity of the *i*-th from the right digit in decimal notation matches the *i*-th from the right digit of the pattern. If the pattern is shorter than this integer, it's supplemented with 0-s from the left. Similarly, if the integer is shorter than the pattern its decimal notation is supplemented with the 0-s from the left. \nFor example, if the pattern is *s*<==<=010, than integers 92, 2212, 50 and 414 match the pattern, while integers 3, 110, 25 and 1030 do not.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains an integer *t* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of operation Sonya has to perform.\n\nNext *t* lines provide the descriptions of the queries in order they appear in the input file. The *i*-th row starts with a character *c**i*\u00a0\u2014 the type of the corresponding operation. If *c**i* is equal to '+' or '-' then it's followed by a space and an integer *a**i* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=&lt;<=1018) given without leading zeroes (unless it's 0). If *c**i* equals '?' then it's followed by a space and a sequence of zeroes and onse, giving the pattern of length no more than 18.\n\nIt's guaranteed that there will be at least one query of type '?'.\n\nIt's guaranteed that any time some integer is removed from the multiset, there will be at least one occurrence of this integer in it..

Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up \u2014 who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that\u2019s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player wins.

Initially, the number 2 is displayed on the screen. There are *n*<=+<=1 levels in the game and ZS the Coder start at the level 1.\n\nWhen ZS the Coder is at level *k*, he can :\n 1.  Press the '<=+<=' button. This increases the number on the screen by exactly *k*. So, if the number on the screen was *x*, it becomes *x*<=+<=*k*.1.  Press the '' button.

How about a statement like that: \"each integer no less than 12 can be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers.\" Not like the Goldbach's conjecture, I can prove this theorem.\n\nYou are given an integer *n* no less than 12, express it as a sum of two composite numbers.\nInput specification: The only line contains an integer *n* (12<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=106).. Output specification: Output two composite integers *x* and *y* (1<=&lt;<=*x*,<=*y*<=&lt;<=*n*) such that *x*<=+<=*y*<==<=*n*. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.\nDemo input: ['12\\n', '15\\n', '23\\n', '1000000\\n'], Demo output: ['4 8\\n', '6 9\\n', '8 15\\n', '500000 500000\\n']\nNote: In the first example, 12 = 4 + 8 and both 4, 8 are composite numbers. You can output \"6 6\" or \"8 4\" as well.\n\nIn the second example, 15 = 6 + 9. Note that you can't output \"1 14\" because 1 is not a composite number."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Little Vasya had *n* boxes with balls in the room. The boxes stood in a row and were numbered with numbers from 1 to *n* from left to right.\n\nOnce Vasya chose one of the boxes, let's assume that its number is *i*, took all balls out from it (it is guaranteed that this box originally had at least one ball), and began putting balls (one at a time) to the boxes with numbers *i*<=+<=1, *i*<=+<=2, *i*<=+<=3 and so on. If Vasya puts a ball into the box number *n*, then the next ball goes to box 1, the next one goes to box 2 and so on. He did it until he had no balls left in his hands. It is possible that Vasya puts multiple balls to the same box, and it is also possible that one or more balls will go to the box number *i*. If *i*<==<=*n*, Vasya puts the first ball into the box number 1, then the next ball goes to box 2 and so on. \n\nFor example, let's suppose that initially Vasya had four boxes, and the first box had 3 balls, the second one had 2, the third one had 5 and the fourth one had 4 balls. Then, if *i*<==<=3, then Vasya will take all five balls out of the third box and put them in the boxes with numbers: 4,<=1,<=2,<=3,<=4. After all Vasya's actions the balls will lie in the boxes as follows: in the first box there are 4 balls, 3 in the second one, 1 in the third one and 6 in the fourth one.\n\nAt this point Vasya has completely forgotten the original arrangement of the balls in the boxes, but he knows how they are arranged now, and the number *x* \u2014 the number of the box, where he put the last of the taken out balls.\n\nHe asks you to help to find the initial arrangement of the balls in the boxes.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *x* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*), that represent the number of the boxes and the index of the box that got the last ball from Vasya, correspondingly.

Bob sees the number on the top of the tower and the numbers on the two adjacent sides (on the right side of the picture shown what Bob sees).\n\nHelp Bob, tell whether it is possible to uniquely identify the numbers on the faces of all the dice in the tower, or not.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of dice in the tower.\n\nThe second line contains an integer *x* (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=6) \u2014 the number Bob sees at the top of the tower. Next *n* lines contain two space-separated integers each: the *i*-th line contains numbers *a**i*,<=*b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=6;\u00a0*a**i*<=\u2260<=*b**i*) \u2014 the numbers Bob sees on the two sidelong faces of the *i*-th dice in the tower.\n\nConsider the dice in the tower indexed from top to bottom from 1 to *n*. That is, the topmost dice has index 1 (the dice whose top face Bob can see). It is guaranteed that it is possible to make a dice tower that will look as described in the input..

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Vasya studies divisibility rules at school. Here are some of them:\n-  Divisibility by 2. A number is divisible by 2 if and only if its last digit is divisible by 2 or in other words, is even.-  Divisibility by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.-  Divisibility by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if and only if its last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4.-  Divisibility by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if and only if its last digit equals 5 or 0.-  Divisibility by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by 2 and 3 simultaneously (that is, if the last digit is even and the sum of all digits is divisible by 3).-  Divisibility by 7. Vasya doesn't know such divisibility rule.-  Divisibility by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if and only if its last three digits form a number that is divisible by 8.-  Divisibility by 9. A number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.-  Divisibility by 10. A number is divisible by 10 if and only if its last digit is a zero.-  Divisibility by 11. A number is divisible by 11 if and only if the sum of digits on its odd positions either equals to the sum of digits on the even positions, or they differ in a number that is divisible by 11.\nVasya got interested by the fact that some divisibility rules resemble each other. In fact, to check a number's divisibility by 2, 4, 5, 8 and 10 it is enough to check fulfiling some condition for one or several last digits. Vasya calls such rules the 2-type rules.\n\nIf checking divisibility means finding a sum of digits and checking whether the sum is divisible by the given number, then Vasya calls this rule the 3-type rule (because it works for numbers 3 and 9).\n\nIf we need to find the difference between the sum of digits on odd and even positions and check whether the difference is divisible by the given divisor, this rule is called the 11-type rule (it works for number 11).\n\nIn some cases we should divide the divisor into several factors and check whether rules of different types (2-type, 3-type or 11-type) work there. For example, for number 6 we check 2-type and 3-type rules, for number 66 we check all three types. Such mixed divisibility rules are called 6-type rules. \n\nAnd finally, there are some numbers for which no rule works: neither 2-type, nor 3-type, nor 11-type, nor 6-type. The least such number is number 7, so we'll say that in such cases the mysterious 7-type rule works, the one that Vasya hasn't discovered yet. \n\nVasya's dream is finding divisibility rules for all possible numbers. He isn't going to stop on the decimal numbers only. As there are quite many numbers, ha can't do it all by himself. Vasya asked you to write a program that determines the divisibility rule type in the *b*-based notation for the given divisor *d*.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *b* and *d* (2<=\u2264<=*b*,<=*d*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the notation system base and the divisor. Both numbers are given in the decimal notation.. Output specification: On the first output line print the type of the rule in the *b*-based notation system, where the divisor is *d*: \"2-type\", \"3-type\", \"11-type\", \"6-type\" or \"7-type\". If there are several such types, print the one that goes earlier in the given sequence. If a number belongs to the 2-type, print on the second line the least number of the last *b*-based digits that we will need to use to check the divisibility.\nDemo input: ['10 10\\n', '2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['2-type\\n1\\n', '11-type\\n']\nNote: The divisibility rule for number 3 in binary notation looks as follows: \"A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits that occupy the even places differs from the sum of digits that occupy the odd places, in a number that is divisible by 3\". That's an 11-type rule. For example, 21<sub class=\"lower-index\">10</sub>\u2009=\u200910101<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>. For it the sum of digits on odd positions equals 1\u2009+\u20091\u2009+\u20091\u2009=\u20093, an on even positions \u2014 0\u2009+\u20090\u2009=\u20090. The rule works and the number is divisible by 3. \n\nIn some notations a number can fit into the 3-type rule and the 11-type rule. In this case the correct answer is \"3-type\"."}]}}

Right now his task is to make a series of reports about the company's performance for the last *n* days. We know that the main information in a day report is value *a**i*, the company's profit on the *i*-th day.

If string *s* contains no two consecutive periods, then nothing happens.\n\nLet's define *f*(*s*) as the minimum number of operations of replacement to perform, so that the string does not have any two consecutive periods left.\n\nYou need to process *m* queries, the *i*-th results in that the character at position *x**i* (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) of string *s* is assigned value *c**i*. After each operation you have to calculate and output the value of *f*(*s*).\n\nHelp Daniel to process all queries.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=300<=000) the length of the string and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line contains string *s*, consisting of *n* lowercase English letters and period signs.\n\nThe following *m* lines contain the descriptions of queries. The *i*-th line contains integer *x**i* and *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, *c**i* \u2014 a lowercas English letter or a period sign), describing the query of assigning symbol *c**i* to position *x**i*..

Write a python script for the following problem: Merge sort is a well-known sorting algorithm. The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:\n 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=\u2264<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* \u2014 *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\nInput specification: The first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it..

If they are equal \u2014 compare the second, and so on. If we have two permutations *x* and *y*, then *x* is lexicographically smaller if *x**i*<=&lt;<=*y**i*, where *i* is the first index in which the permutations *x* and *y* differ.\n\nDetermine the array Ivan will obtain after performing all the changes.\nInput specification: The first line contains an single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200<=000) \u2014 the number of elements in Ivan's array.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the description of Ivan's array..

Write a python script for the following problem: In this problem you will meet the simplified model of game King of Thieves.\n\nIn a new ZeptoLab game called \"King of Thieves\" your aim is to reach a chest with gold by controlling your character, avoiding traps and obstacles on your way.\n\nAn interesting feature of the game is that you can design your own levels that will be available to other players. Let's consider the following simple design of a level.\n\nA dungeon consists of *n* segments located at a same vertical level, each segment is either a platform that character can stand on, or a pit with a trap that makes player lose if he falls into it. All segments have the same length, platforms on the scheme of the level are represented as '*' and pits are represented as '.'. \n\nOne of things that affects speedrun characteristics of the level is a possibility to perform a series of consecutive jumps of the same length. More formally, when the character is on the platform number *i*1, he can make a sequence of jumps through the platforms *i*1<=&lt;<=*i*2<=&lt;<=...<=&lt;<=*i**k*, if *i*2<=-<=*i*1<==<=*i*3<=-<=*i*2<==<=...<==<=*i**k*<=-<=*i**k*<=-<=1. Of course, all segments *i*1,<=*i*2,<=... *i**k* should be exactly the platforms, not pits. \n\nLet's call a level to be good if you can perform a sequence of four jumps of the same length or in the other words there must be a sequence *i*1,<=*i*2,<=...,<=*i*5, consisting of five platforms so that the intervals between consecutive platforms are of the same length. Given the scheme of the level, check if it is good.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of segments on the level.\n\nNext line contains the scheme of the level represented as a string of *n* characters '*' and '.'..

Write a python script for the following problem: Kicker (table football) is a board game based on football, in which players control the footballers' figures mounted on rods by using bars to get the ball into the opponent's goal. When playing two on two, one player of each team controls the goalkeeper and the full-backs (plays defence), the other player controls the half-backs and forwards (plays attack).\n\nTwo teams of company Q decided to battle each other. Let's enumerate players from both teams by integers from 1 to 4. The first and second player play in the first team, the third and the fourth one play in the second team. For each of the four players we know their game skills in defence and attack. The defence skill of the *i*-th player is *a**i*, the attack skill is *b**i*.\n\nBefore the game, the teams determine how they will play. First the players of the first team decide who will play in the attack, and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do the same, based on the choice of their opponents.\n\nWe will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.\n\nThe teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally. Identify the team that is guaranteed to win (if both teams act optimally) or tell that there is no such team.\nInput specification: The input contain the players' description in four lines. The *i*-th line contains two space-separated integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the defence and the attack skill of the *i*-th player, correspondingly.. Output specification: If the first team can win, print phrase \"Team 1\" (without the quotes), if the second team can win, print phrase \"Team 2\" (without the quotes).

The first team can definitely win if it will choose the following arrangement: the first player plays attack, the second player plays defence.\n\nConsider the second sample. The order of the choosing roles for players makes sense in this sample. As the members of the first team choose first, the members of the second team can beat them (because they know the exact defence value and attack value of the first team)."}]}}

Each train consists of two or more neighbouring cells in some row of the field.\n\nAll trains are moving from right to left at a speed of two cells per second, and the hero runs from left to right at the speed of one cell per second. For simplicity, the game is implemented so that the hero and the trains move in turns. First, the hero moves one cell to the right, then one square up or down, or stays idle. Then all the trains move twice simultaneously one cell to the left. Thus, in one move, Philip definitely makes a move to the right and can move up or down. If at any point, Philip is in the same cell with a train, he loses. If the train reaches the left column, it continues to move as before, leaving the tunnel.\n\nYour task is to answer the question whether there is a sequence of movements of Philip, such that he would be able to get to the rightmost column.\nInput specification: Each test contains from one to ten sets of the input data. The first line of the test contains a single integer *t* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=10 for pretests and tests or *t*<==<=1 for hacks; see the Notes section for details) \u2014 the number of sets.\n\nThen follows the description of *t* sets of the input data. \n\nThe first line of the description of each set contains two integers *n*,<=*k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100,<=1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=26) \u2014 the number of columns on the field and the number of trains.

Each of the *k* trains is marked by some sequence of identical uppercase letters of the English alphabet, located in one line. Distinct trains are represented by distinct letters. Character '.' represents an empty cell, that is, the cell that doesn't contain either Philip or the trains..

Guests from all over the kingdom gather here to discuss new trends in the world of confectionery. Yet some of the things discussed here are not supposed to be disclosed to the general public: the information can cause discord in the kingdom of Sweetland in case it turns out to reach the wrong hands. So it's a necessity to not let any uninvited guests in.\n\nThere are 26 entrances in Jelly Castle, enumerated with uppercase English letters from A to Z. Because of security measures, each guest is known to be assigned an entrance he should enter the castle through. The door of each entrance is opened right before the first guest's arrival and closed right after the arrival of the last guest that should enter the castle through this entrance. No two guests can enter the castle simultaneously.\n\nFor an entrance to be protected from possible intrusion, a candy guard should be assigned to it. There are *k* such guards in the castle, so if there are more than *k* opened doors, one of them is going to be left unguarded! Notice that a guard can't leave his post until the door he is assigned to is closed.\n\nSlastyona had a suspicion that there could be uninvited guests at the evening.

Then he needs to change the substring *t* zero or more times. As a result, he should obtain a fixed string *u* (which is the string that should be sent to Sherlock Holmes). One change is defined as making one of the following actions: \n -  Insert one letter to any end of the string. -  Delete one letter from any end of the string. -  Change one letter into any other one. \nMoriarty is very smart and after he chooses some substring *t*, he always makes the minimal number of changes to obtain *u*. \n\nHelp Moriarty choose the best substring *t* from all substrings of the string *s*.

Then you will only have to make one change: to change or to add the last character.\n\nIn the third sample the initial string *s* doesn't contain any character that the message should contain, so, whatever string you choose, you will have to make at least 7 changes to obtain the required message."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: After the big birthday party, Katie still wanted Shiro to have some more fun. Later, she came up with a game called treasure hunt. Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\n\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.. Output specification: Print the name of the winner (\"Kuro\", \"Shiro\" or \"Katie\"). If there are at least two cats that share the maximum beauty, print \"Draw\".\nDemo input: ['3\\nKuroo\\nShiro\\nKatie\\n', '7\\ntreasurehunt\\nthreefriends\\nhiCodeforces\\n', '1\\nabcabc\\ncbabac\\nababca\\n', '15\\nfoPaErcvJ\\nmZaxowpbt\\nmkuOlaHRE\\n'], Demo output: ['Kuro\\n', 'Shiro\\n', 'Katie\\n', 'Draw\\n']\nNote: In the first example, after $3$ turns, Kuro can change his ribbon into ooooo, which has the beauty of $5$, while reaching such beauty for Shiro and Katie is impossible (both Shiro and Katie can reach the beauty of at most $4$, for example by changing Shiro's ribbon into SSiSS and changing Katie's ribbon into Kaaaa). Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice. Therefore, the game ends in a draw."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Edo has got a collection of *n* refrigerator magnets!\n\nHe decided to buy a refrigerator and hang the magnets on the door. The shop can make the refrigerator with any size of the door that meets the following restrictions: the refrigerator door must be rectangle, and both the length and the width of the door must be positive integers.\n\nEdo figured out how he wants to place the magnets on the refrigerator. He introduced a system of coordinates on the plane, where each magnet is represented as a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.\n\nNow he wants to remove no more than *k* magnets (he may choose to keep all of them) and attach all remaining magnets to the refrigerator door, and the area of \u200b\u200bthe door should be as small as possible. A magnet is considered to be attached to the refrigerator door if its center lies on the door or on its boundary. The relative positions of all the remaining magnets must correspond to the plan.\n\nLet us explain the last two sentences. Let's suppose we want to hang two magnets on the refrigerator. If the magnet in the plan has coordinates of the lower left corner (*x*1, *y*1) and the upper right corner (*x*2, *y*2), then its center is located at (, ) (may not be integers). By saying the relative position should correspond to the plan we mean that the only available operation is translation, i.e. the vector connecting the centers of two magnets in the original plan, must be equal to the vector connecting the centers of these two magnets on the refrigerator.\n\nThe sides of the refrigerator door must also be parallel to coordinate axes.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000, 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*min*(10,<=*n*<=-<=1))\u00a0\u2014 the number of magnets that Edo has and the maximum number of magnets Edo may not place on the refrigerator.\n\nNext *n* lines describe the initial plan of placing magnets.

If we remove the first magnet, the centers of two others will lie at points (2.5, 2.5) and (3.5, 3.5). Thus, it is enough to buy a fridge with door width 1 and door height 1, the area of the door also equals one, correspondingly.\n\nIn the second test sample it doesn't matter which magnet to remove, the answer will not change \u2014 we need a fridge with door width 8 and door height 8.\n\nIn the third sample you cannot remove anything as *k*\u2009=\u20090."}]}}

Two ways are considered different if two characters are in love in one way but hate each other in the other. Print this count modulo 1<=000<=000<=007.\nInput specification: The first line of input will contain two integers *n*,<=*m* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000, 0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100<=000).\n\nThe next *m* lines will contain the description of the known relationships. The *i*-th line will contain three integers *a**i*,<=*b**i*,<=*c**i*. If *c**i* is 1, then *a**i* and *b**i* are in love, otherwise, they hate each other (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, *a**i*<=\u2260<=*b**i*, ).\n\nEach pair of people will be described no more than once.. Output specification: Print a single integer equal to the number of ways to fill in the remaining pairs so that you are happy with every triangle modulo 1<=000<=000<=007.\nDemo input: ['3 0\\n', '4 4\\n1 2 1\\n2 3 1\\n3 4 0\\n4 1 0\\n', '4 4\\n1 2 1\\n2 3 1\\n3 4 0\\n4 1 1\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n', '1\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, the four ways are to: \n -  Make everyone love each other -  Make 1 and 2 love each other, and 3 hate 1 and 2 (symmetrically, we get 3 ways from this). \nIn the second sample, the only possible solution is to make 1 and 3 love each other and 2 and 4 hate each other."}]}}

DravDe can get on the plane in point *A*, fly for some time, and then air drop himself. DravDe is very heavy, that's why he falls vertically at speed *F**down*, but in each point of his free fall DravDe can open his parachute, and from that moment he starts to fall at the wind speed *U*(*x**u*,<=*y**u*,<=*z**u*) until he lands.

Kaiki provides another sequence *b*, whose length *k* equals the number of lost elements in *a* (i.e. the number of zeros). Hitagi is to replace each zero in *a* with an element from *b* so that each element in *b* should be used exactly once.

Therefore, your task is to find three distinct numbers (*a*,<=*b*,<=*c*), for which the statement is false, and the numbers meet the condition *l*<=\u2264<=*a*<=&lt;<=*b*<=&lt;<=*c*<=\u2264<=*r*. \n\nMore specifically, you need to find three numbers (*a*,<=*b*,<=*c*), such that *l*<=\u2264<=*a*<=&lt;<=*b*<=&lt;<=*c*<=\u2264<=*r*, pairs (*a*,<=*b*) and (*b*,<=*c*) are coprime, and pair (*a*,<=*c*) is not coprime.\nInput specification: The single line contains two positive space-separated integers *l*, *r* (1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=*r*<=\u2264<=1018; *r*<=-<=*l*<=\u2264<=50).. Output specification: Print three positive space-separated integers *a*, *b*, *c*\u00a0\u2014 three distinct numbers (*a*,<=*b*,<=*c*) that form the counterexample. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them. The numbers must be printed in ascending order. \n\nIf the counterexample does not exist, print the single number -1.\nDemo input: ['2 4\\n', '10 11\\n', '900000000000000009 900000000000000029\\n'], Demo output: ['2 3 4\\n', '-1\\n', '900000000000000009 900000000000000010 900000000000000021\\n']\nNote: In the first sample pair (2,\u20094) is not coprime and pairs (2,\u20093) and (3,\u20094) are. \n\nIn the second sample you cannot form a group of three distinct integers, so the answer is -1. \n\nIn the third sample it is easy to see that numbers 900000000000000009 and 900000000000000021 are divisible by three."}]}}

He's been working there for a long time and is satisfied with his job, as it allows him to eat out in the best restaurants and order the most expensive and exotic wood types there. \n\nThe content special agent has got an important task: to get the latest research by British scientists on the English Language. These developments are encoded and stored in a large safe. The Beaver's teeth are strong enough, so the authorities assured that upon arriving at the place the beaver won't have any problems with opening the safe.\n\nAnd he finishes his aspen sprig and leaves for this important task. Of course, the Beaver arrived at the location without any problems, but alas. He can't open the safe with his strong and big teeth. At this point, the Smart Beaver get a call from the headquarters and learns that opening the safe with the teeth is not necessary, as a reliable source has sent the following information: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. There also is a special hint, which can be used to open the safe. The hint is string *s* with the following structure:\n -  if *s**i* = \"?\", then the digit that goes *i*-th in the safe code can be anything (between 0 to 9, inclusively); -  if *s**i* is a digit (between 0 to 9, inclusively), then it means that there is digit *s**i* on position *i* in code; -  if the string contains letters from \"A\" to \"J\", then all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits and the positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits. -  The length of the safe code coincides with the length of the hint. \nFor example, hint \"?JGJ9\" has such matching safe code variants: \"51919\", \"55959\", \"12329\", \"93539\" and so on, and has wrong variants such as: \"56669\", \"00111\", \"03539\" and \"13666\".\n\nAfter receiving such information, the authorities change the plan and ask the special agents to work quietly and gently and not to try to open the safe by mechanical means, and try to find the password using the given hint.\n\nAt a special agent school the Smart Beaver was the fastest in his platoon finding codes for such safes, but now he is not in that shape: the years take their toll ... Help him to determine the number of possible variants of the code to the safe, matching the given hint. After receiving this information, and knowing his own speed of entering codes, the Smart Beaver will be able to determine whether he will have time for tonight's show \"Beavers are on the trail\" on his favorite TV channel, or he should work for a sleepless night...\nInput specification: The first line contains string *s* \u2014 the hint to the safe code.

Write a python script for the following problem: Bob is a farmer. He has a large pasture with many sheep. Recently, he has lost some of them due to wolf attacks. He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.

Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: A long time ago (probably even in the first book), Nicholas Flamel, a great alchemist and the creator of the Philosopher's Stone, taught Harry Potter three useful spells. The first one allows you to convert *a* grams of sand into *b* grams of lead, the second one allows you to convert *c* grams of lead into *d* grams of gold and third one allows you to convert *e* grams of gold into *f* grams of sand. When Harry told his friends about these spells, Ron Weasley was amazed. After all, if they succeed in turning sand into lead, lead into gold, and then turning part of the gold into sand again and so on, then it will be possible to start with a small amount of sand and get huge amounts of gold! Even an infinite amount of gold! Hermione Granger, by contrast, was skeptical about that idea. She argues that according to the law of conservation of matter getting an infinite amount of matter, even using magic, is impossible. On the contrary, the amount of matter may even decrease during transformation, being converted to magical energy. Though Hermione's theory seems convincing, Ron won't believe her. As far as Ron is concerned, Hermione made up her law of conservation of matter to stop Harry and Ron wasting their time with this nonsense, and to make them go and do homework instead. That's why Ron has already collected a certain amount of sand for the experiments. A quarrel between the friends seems unavoidable...\n\nHelp Harry to determine which one of his friends is right, and avoid the quarrel after all. To do this you have to figure out whether it is possible to get the amount of gold greater than any preassigned number from some finite amount of sand.\nInput specification: The first line contains 6 integers *a*, *b*, *c*, *d*, *e*, *f* (0<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*,<=*c*,<=*d*,<=*e*,<=*f*<=\u2264<=1000).. Output specification: Print \"Ron\", if it is possible to get an infinitely large amount of gold having a certain finite amount of sand (and not having any gold and lead at all), i.e., Ron is right. Otherwise, print \"Hermione\".\nDemo input: ['100 200 250 150 200 250\\n', '100 50 50 200 200 100\\n', '100 10 200 20 300 30\\n', '0 0 0 0 0 0\\n', '1 1 0 1 1 1\\n', '1 0 1 2 1 2\\n', '100 1 100 1 0 1\\n'], Demo output: ['Ron\\n', 'Hermione\\n', 'Hermione\\n', 'Hermione\\n', 'Ron\\n', 'Hermione\\n', 'Ron\\n']\nNote: Consider the first sample. Let's start with the 500 grams of sand. Apply the first spell 5 times and turn the sand into 1000 grams of lead. Then apply the second spell 4 times to get 600 grams of gold. Let\u2019s take 400 grams from the resulting amount of gold turn them back into sand. We get 500 grams of sand and 200 grams of gold. If we apply the same operations to 500 grams of sand again, we can get extra 200 grams of gold every time. Thus, you can get 200, 400, 600 etc. grams of gold, i.e., starting with a finite amount of sand (500 grams), you can get the amount of gold which is greater than any preassigned number.\n\nIn the forth sample it is impossible to get sand, or lead, or gold, applying the spells.\n\nIn the fifth sample an infinitely large amount of gold can be obtained by using only the second spell, which allows you to receive 1 gram of gold out of nothing. Note that if such a second spell is available, then the first and the third one do not affect the answer at all.\n\nThe seventh sample is more interesting. We can also start with a zero amount of sand there. With the aid of the third spell you can get sand out of nothing. We get 10000 grams of sand in this manner. Let's get 100 grams of lead using the first spell 100 times. Then make 1 gram of gold from them. We managed to receive 1 gram of gold, starting with a zero amount of sand!

Write a python script for the following problem: Manao is taking part in a quiz. The quiz consists of *n* consecutive questions. A correct answer gives one point to the player. The game also has a counter of consecutive correct answers. When the player answers a question correctly, the number on this counter increases by 1. If the player answers a question incorrectly, the counter is reset, that is, the number on it reduces to 0. If after an answer the counter reaches the number *k*, then it is reset, and the player's score is doubled. Note that in this case, first 1 point is added to the player's score, and then the total score is doubled. At the beginning of the game, both the player's score and the counter of consecutive correct answers are set to zero.\n\nManao remembers that he has answered exactly *m* questions correctly. But he does not remember the order in which the questions came. He's trying to figure out what his minimum score may be.

If Manao had answered the first, third and fifth questions, he would have scored as much as 3 points.\n\nSample 2. Now Manao answered 4 questions. The minimum possible score is obtained when the only wrong answer is to the question 4.\n\nAlso note that you are asked to minimize the score and not the remainder of the score modulo 1000000009.

Write a python script for the following problem: Wilbur is playing with a set of *n* points on the coordinate plane. All points have non-negative integer coordinates. Moreover, if some point (*x*, *y*) belongs to the set, then all points (*x*', *y*'), such that 0<=\u2264<=*x*'<=\u2264<=*x* and 0<=\u2264<=*y*'<=\u2264<=*y* also belong to this set.\n\nNow Wilbur wants to number the points in the set he has, that is assign them distinct integer numbers from 1 to *n*. In order to make the numbering aesthetically pleasing, Wilbur imposes the condition that if some point (*x*, *y*) gets number *i*, then all (*x*',*y*') from the set, such that *x*'<=\u2265<=*x* and *y*'<=\u2265<=*y* must be assigned a number not less than *i*. For example, for a set of four points (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0) and (1, 1), there are two aesthetically pleasing numberings. One is 1, 2, 3, 4 and another one is 1, 3, 2, 4.\n\nWilbur's friend comes along and challenges Wilbur. For any point he defines it's special value as *s*(*x*,<=*y*)<==<=*y*<=-<=*x*. Now he gives Wilbur some *w*1, *w*2,..., *w**n*, and asks him to find an aesthetically pleasing numbering of the points in the set, such that the point that gets number *i* has it's special value equal to *w**i*, that is *s*(*x**i*,<=*y**i*)<==<=*y**i*<=-<=*x**i*<==<=*w**i*.\n\nNow Wilbur asks you to help him with this challenge.\nInput specification: The first line of the input consists of a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of points in the set Wilbur is playing with.\n\nNext follow *n* lines with points descriptions.

Also, it is guaranteed that if some point (*x*, *y*) is present in the input, then all points (*x*', *y*'), such that 0<=\u2264<=*x*'<=\u2264<=*x* and 0<=\u2264<=*y*'<=\u2264<=*y*, are also present in the input.\n\nThe last line of the input contains *n* integers.

For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards.\n\nAs before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8<=\u00d7<=8 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke.\n\nKalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client's requirements.\n\nIt goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything \u2014 for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's needs.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, on a programming lesson little Petya showed how quickly he can create files and folders on the computer. But he got soon fed up with this activity, and he decided to do a much more useful thing. He decided to calculate what folder contains most subfolders (including nested folders, nested folders of nested folders, and so on) and what folder contains most files (including the files in the subfolders).\n\nMore formally, the subfolders of the folder are all its directly nested folders and the subfolders of these nested folders. The given folder is not considered the subfolder of itself. A file is regarded as lying in a folder, if and only if it either lies directly in this folder, or lies in some subfolder of the folder.\n\nFor a better understanding of how to count subfolders and files for calculating the answer, see notes and answers to the samples.\n\nYou are given a few files that Petya has managed to create. The path to each file looks as follows:\n\n*diskName*:\\*folder*1\\*folder*2\\...\\ *folder**n*\\*fileName* \n-  *diskName* is single capital letter from the set {C,D,E,F,G}.-  *folder*1, ..., *folder**n* are folder names. Each folder name is nonempty sequence of lowercase Latin letters and digits from 0 to 9. (*n*<=\u2265<=1)-  *fileName* is a file name in the form of *name*.*extension*, where the *name* and the *extension* are nonempty sequences of lowercase Latin letters and digits from 0 to 9. \nIt is also known that there is no file whose path looks like *diskName*:\\*fileName*. That is, each file is stored in some folder, but there are no files directly in the root. Also let us assume that the disk root is not a folder.\n\nHelp Petya to find the largest number of subfolders, which can be in some folder, and the largest number of files that can be in some folder, counting all its subfolders.\nInput specification: Each line of input data contains the description of one file path. The length of each line does not exceed 100, and overall there are no more than 100 lines. It is guaranteed, that all the paths are correct and meet the above rules. It is also guaranteed, that there are no two completely equal lines. That is, each file is described exactly once.\n\nThere is at least one line in the input data.. Output specification: Print two space-separated numbers. The first one is the maximal number of possible subfolders in a folder (including nested folders, nested folders of nested folders, and so on). The second one is the maximal number of files in a folder (including nested files in subfolders). Note that the disks are not regarded as folders.\nDemo input: ['C:\\\\folder1\\\\file1.txt', 'C:\\\\folder1\\\\folder2\\\\folder3\\\\file1.txt\\nC:\\\\folder1\\\\folder2\\\\folder4\\\\file1.txt\\nD:\\\\folder1\\\\file1.txt\\n', 'C:\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file.txt\\nC:\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file2\\\\file.txt'], Demo output: ['0 1', '3 2', '4 2']\nNote: In the first sample we have one folder on the \"C\" disk. It has no subfolders, which is why the first number in the answer is 0. But this folder contains one file, so the second number of the answer is 1.\n\nIn the second sample we have several different folders. Consider the \"folder1\" folder on the \"C\" disk. This folder directly contains one folder, \"folder2\". The \"folder2\" folder contains two more folders \u2014 \"folder3\" and \"folder4\". Thus, the \"folder1\" folder on the \"C\" drive has exactly 3 subfolders. Also this folder contains two files, even though they do not lie directly in the folder, but they are located in subfolders of \"folder1\".\n\nIn the third example we see that the names of some folders and some subfolders are identical. Consider the \"file\" folder, which lies directly on the \"C\" disk. That folder contains another \"file\" folder, which in turn contains another \"file\" folder, which contains two more folders, \"file\" and \"file2\". Thus, the \"file\" folder, which lies directly on the \"C\" disk, contains 4 subfolders."}]}}

Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\n\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.. Output specification: Print the name of the winner (\"Kuro\", \"Shiro\" or \"Katie\"). If there are at least two cats that share the maximum beauty, print \"Draw\".\nDemo input: ['3\\nKuroo\\nShiro\\nKatie\\n', '7\\ntreasurehunt\\nthreefriends\\nhiCodeforces\\n', '1\\nabcabc\\ncbabac\\nababca\\n', '15\\nfoPaErcvJ\\nmZaxowpbt\\nmkuOlaHRE\\n'], Demo output: ['Kuro\\n', 'Shiro\\n', 'Katie\\n', 'Draw\\n']\nNote: In the first example, after $3$ turns, Kuro can change his ribbon into ooooo, which has the beauty of $5$, while reaching such beauty for Shiro and Katie is impossible (both Shiro and Katie can reach the beauty of at most $4$, for example by changing Shiro's ribbon into SSiSS and changing Katie's ribbon into Kaaaa). Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice.

Write a python script for the following problem: Bob is a farmer. He has a large pasture with many sheep. Recently, he has lost some of them due to wolf attacks. He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of dogs.\nDemo input: ['6 6\\n..S...\\n..S.W.\\n.S....\\n..W...\\n...W..\\n......\\n', '1 2\\nSW\\n', '5 5\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS....\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n..SD..\\n..SDW.\\n.SD...\\n.DW...\\nDD.W..\\n......\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS.D..\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n']\nNote: In the first example, we can split the pasture into two halves, one containing wolves and one containing sheep. Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.\n\nCreating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section. At that, the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section. That is, for example, the garden can be represented by a 1<=\u00d7<=5 rectangle, where the section heights are equal to 4, 2, 3, 3, 2.

The scientific notation of some real number *x* is the notation of form *AeB*, where *A* is a real number and *B* is an integer and *x*<==<=*A*<=\u00d7<=10*B* is true. In our case *A* is between 0 and 9 and *B* is non-negative.\n\nBarney doesn't know anything about scientific notation (as well as anything scientific at all). So he asked you to tell him the distance value in usual decimal representation with minimal number of digits after the decimal point (and no decimal point if it is an integer). See the output format for better understanding.\nInput specification: The first and only line of input contains a single string of form *a*.*deb* where *a*, *d* and *b* are integers and *e* is usual character 'e' (0<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=9,<=0<=\u2264<=*d*<=&lt;<=10100,<=0<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the scientific notation of the desired distance value.\n\n*a* and *b* contain no leading zeros and *d* contains no trailing zeros (but may be equal to 0). Also, *b* can not be non-zero if *a* is zero.. Output specification: Print the only real number *x* (the desired distance value) in the only line in its decimal notation. \n\nThus if *x* is an integer, print it's integer value without decimal part and decimal point and without leading zeroes. \n\nOtherwise print *x* in a form of *p*.*q* such that *p* is an integer that have no leading zeroes (but may be equal to zero), and *q* is an integer that have no trailing zeroes (and may not be equal to zero).\nDemo input: ['8.549e2\\n', '8.549e3\\n', '0.33e0\\n'], Demo output: ['854.9\\n', '8549\\n', '0.33\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

And she has found one!\n\nWhy not make her own Codeforces, with blackjack and other really cool stuff? Many people will surely be willing to visit this splendid shrine of high culture.\n\nIn Mainframe a standard pack of 52 cards is used to play blackjack. The pack contains cards of 13 values: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jacks, queens, kings and aces. Each value also exists in one of four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. Also, each card earns some value in points assigned to it: cards with value from two to ten earn from 2 to 10 points, correspondingly. An ace can either earn 1 or 11, whatever the player wishes. The picture cards (king, queen and jack) earn 10 points. The number of points a card earns does not depend on the suit. The rules of the game are very simple. The player gets two cards, if the sum of points of those cards equals *n*, then the player wins, otherwise the player loses.\n\nThe player has already got the first card, it's the queen of spades. To evaluate chances for victory, you should determine how many ways there are to get the second card so that the sum of points exactly equals *n*.\nInput specification: The only line contains *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=25) \u2014 the required sum of points..

People wanted to meet people who live in other cells.\n\nSo, user tncks0121 has made a transportation system to move between these cells, to celebrate the New Year. First, he thought of *n*<=-<=1 positive integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1.

The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) portal connects cell *i* and cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*), and one can travel from cell *i* to cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) using the *i*-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) to cell *i* using the *i*-th portal. It is easy to see that because of condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* one can't leave the Line World using portals.\n\nCurrently, I am standing at cell 1, and I want to go to cell *t*.

A photographic rifle is obviously for Sharic who loves hunting and fish is for Matroskin, but for whom was a new video game console meant? Every one of the three friends claimed that the present is for him and nearly quarreled. Uncle Fyodor had an idea how to solve the problem justly: they should suppose that the console was sent to all three of them and play it in turns. Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up \u2014 who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that\u2019s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player wins. Otherwise, another game round is required.

It continues until Dima is through with his tasks.\n\nOverall, Dima has *n* tasks to do, each task has a unique number from 1 to *n*. Dima loves order, so he does tasks consecutively, starting from some task. For example, if Dima has 6 tasks to do in total, then, if he starts from the 5-th task, the order is like that: first Dima does the 5-th task, then the 6-th one, then the 1-st one, then the 2-nd one, then the 3-rd one, then the 4-th one.\n\nInna tells Dima off (only lovingly and appropriately!) so often and systematically that he's very well learned the power with which she tells him off for each task.

Fortunately, there is a special device in Codeforces that allows her to instantly teleport from Codeforces to any city of Byteforces. The way back is too long, so for the purpose of this problem teleportation is used exactly once.\n\nYou are to help Super M, by calculating the city in which she should teleport at the beginning in order to end her job in the minimum time (measured in krons). Also, provide her with this time so she can plan her way back to Codeforces.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=123456) - the number of cities in Byteforces, and the number of cities being attacked respectively.\n\nThen follow *n*<=-<=1 lines, describing the road system. Each line contains two city numbers *u**i* and *v**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) - the ends of the road *i*.\n\nThe last line contains *m* distinct integers - numbers of cities being attacked. These numbers are given in no particular order.. Output specification: First print the number of the city Super M should teleport to. If there are many possible optimal answers, print the one with the lowest city number.\n\nThen print the minimum possible time needed to scare all humans in cities being attacked, measured in Krons.\n\nNote that the correct answer is always unique.\nDemo input: ['7 2\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n1 4\\n3 5\\n3 6\\n3 7\\n2 7\\n', '6 4\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n2 4\\n4 5\\n4 6\\n2 4 5 6\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n3\\n', '2\\n4\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, there are two possibilities to finish the Super M's job in 3 krons. They are:\n\n<img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/93d3c0306b529e9c2324f68158ca2156587473a2.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> and <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/df80aa84591eaa7b9f52c88cc43b5f7da5bfead3.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>.\n\nHowever, you should choose the first one as it starts in the city with the lower number."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Dasha logged into the system and began to solve problems. One of them is as follows:\n\nGiven two sequences *a* and *b* of length *n* each you need to write a sequence *c* of length *n*, the *i*-th element of which is calculated as follows: *c**i*<==<=*b**i*<=-<=*a**i*.\n\nAbout sequences *a* and *b* we know that their elements are in the range from *l* to *r*. More formally, elements satisfy the following conditions: *l*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*r* and *l*<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*r*. About sequence *c* we know that all its elements are distinct.\n\nDasha wrote a solution to that problem quickly, but checking her work on the standard test was not so easy. Due to an error in the test system only the sequence *a* and the compressed sequence of the sequence *c* were known from that test.\n\nLet's give the definition to a compressed sequence. A compressed sequence of sequence *c* of length *n* is a sequence *p* of length *n*, so that *p**i* equals to the number of integers which are less than or equal to *c**i* in the sequence *c*. For example, for the sequence *c*<==<=[250,<=200,<=300,<=100,<=50] the compressed sequence will be *p*<==<=[4,<=3,<=5,<=2,<=1]. Pay attention that in *c* all integers are distinct. Consequently, the compressed sequence contains all integers from 1 to *n* inclusively.\n\nHelp Dasha to find any sequence *b* for which the calculated compressed sequence of sequence *c* is correct.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *l*, *r* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105,<=1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=*r*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the length of the sequence and boundaries of the segment where the elements of sequences *a* and *b* are.\n\nThe next line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=<=*a*2,<=<=...,<=<=*a**n* (*l*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*r*) \u2014 the elements of the sequence *a*.\n\nThe next line contains *n* distinct integers *p*1,<=<=*p*2,<=<=...,<=<=*p**n* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the compressed sequence of the sequence *c*..

If the word consists of single letter, then according to above definition this letter is the median letter. \n\nPolycarp encodes each word in the following way: he writes down the median letter of the word, then deletes it and repeats the process until there are no letters left. For example, he encodes the word volga as logva.\n\nYou are given an encoding *s* of some word, your task is to decode it.\nInput specification: The first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2000)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the encoded word.\n\nThe second line contains the string *s* of length *n* consisting of lowercase English letters\u00a0\u2014 the encoding.. Output specification: Print the word that Polycarp encoded.\nDemo input: ['5\\nlogva\\n', '2\\nno\\n', '4\\nabba\\n'], Demo output: ['volga\\n', 'no\\n', 'baba\\n']\nNote: In the first example Polycarp encoded the word volga. At first, he wrote down the letter l from the position 3, after that his word looked like voga. After that Polycarp wrote down the letter o from the position 2, his word became vga. Then Polycarp wrote down the letter g which was at the second position, the word became va. Then he wrote down the letter v, then the letter a. Thus, the encoding looked like logva.\n\nIn the second example Polycarp encoded the word no. He wrote down the letter n, the word became o, and he wrote down the letter o. Thus, in this example, the word and its encoding are the same.\n\nIn the third example Polycarp encoded the word baba. At first, he wrote down the letter a, which was at the position 2, after that the word looked like bba. Then he wrote down the letter b, which was at the position 2, his word looked like ba. After that he wrote down the letter b, which was at the position 1, the word looked like a, and he wrote down that letter a. Thus, the encoding is abba."}]}}

At the moment he is studying the application of greedy algorithm to the problem about change. There is an amount of *n* coins of different face values, and the coins of each value are not limited in number. The task is to collect the sum *x* with the minimum amount of coins. Greedy algorithm with each its step takes the coin of the highest face value, not exceeding *x*.

However, greedy algorithm does not always give the optimal representation of the sum, i.e. the representation with the minimum amount of coins. For example, if there are face values {1,<=3,<=4} and it is asked to collect the sum 6, greedy algorithm will represent the sum as 4<=+<=1<=+<=1, while the optimal representation is 3<=+<=3, containing one coin less.

Write a python script for the following problem: By 2312 there were *n* Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*)..

The wires run along the floor from the wall (on the left) to the device (on the right). Both the wall and the device have two contacts in them on the same level, into which the wires are plugged in some order. The wires are considered entangled if there are one or more places where one wire runs above the other one. For example, the picture below has four such places (top view):\n\nMike knows the sequence in which the wires run above each other.

Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.\n\nCodeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is *x*, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute *m* but made *w* wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is . His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.\n\nAll arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding.

The spider moves from point *p*1 with coordinates (*x*1,<=*y*1) to point *p*2 with coordinates (*x*2,<=*y*2), at that points *p*1 and *p*2 must lie on one vertical straight line (*x*1<==<=*x*2), point *p*1 must be not lower than point *p*2 (*y*1<=\u2265<=*y*2) and segment *p*1*p*2 mustn't have points, located strictly outside the polygon (specifically, the segment can have common points with the border). \nInitially the spider is located at the polygon vertex with number *s*. Find the length of the shortest path to the vertex number *t*, consisting of transfers and descends. The distance is determined by the usual Euclidean metric .\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of vertexes of the given polygon. Next *n* lines contain two space-separated integers each \u2014 the coordinates of the polygon vertexes. The vertexes are listed in the counter-clockwise order. The coordinates of the polygon vertexes do not exceed 104 in their absolute value. \n\nThe last line contains two space-separated integers *s* and *t* (1<=\u2264<=*s*,<=*t*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the start and the end vertexes of the sought shortest way. \n\nConsider the polygon vertexes numbered in the order they are given in the input, that is, the coordinates of the first vertex are located on the second line of the input and the coordinates of the *n*-th vertex are on the (*n*<=+<=1)-th line. It is guaranteed that the given polygon is simple, that is, it contains no self-intersections or self-tangencies.. Output specification: In the output print a single real number \u2014 the length of the shortest way from vertex *s* to vertex *t*. The answer is considered correct, if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10<=-<=6.\nDemo input: ['4\\n0 0\\n1 0\\n1 1\\n0 1\\n1 4\\n', '4\\n0 0\\n1 1\\n0 2\\n-1 1\\n3 3\\n', '5\\n0 0\\n5 0\\n1 4\\n0 2\\n2 1\\n3 1\\n'], Demo output: ['1.000000000000000000e+000\\n', '0.000000000000000000e+000\\n', '5.650281539872884700e+000\\n']\nNote: In the first sample the spider transfers along the side that connects vertexes 1 and 4.\n\nIn the second sample the spider doesn't have to transfer anywhere, so the distance equals zero.\n\nIn the third sample the best strategy for the spider is to transfer from vertex 3 to point (2,3), descend to point (2,1), and then transfer to vertex 1."}]}}

Each board is a 1 centimeter wide rectangle. Let's number the board fence using numbers 1,<=2,<=...,<=*n* from left to right. The height of the *i*-th board is *h**i* centimeters.\n\nVasya has a 1 centimeter wide brush and the paint of two colors, red and green. Of course, the amount of the paint is limited. Vasya counted the area he can paint each of the colors. It turned out that he can not paint over *a* square centimeters of the fence red, and he can not paint over *b* square centimeters green. Each board of the fence should be painted exactly one of the two colors. Perhaps Vasya won't need one of the colors.\n\nIn addition, Vasya wants his fence to look smart. To do this, he should paint the fence so as to minimize the value that Vasya called the fence unattractiveness value. Vasya believes that two consecutive fence boards, painted different colors, look unattractive. The unattractiveness value of a fence is the total length of contact between the neighboring boards of various colors. To make the fence look nice, you need to minimize the value as low as possible. Your task is to find what is the minimum unattractiveness Vasya can get, if he paints his fence completely.\n\nThe picture shows the fence, where the heights of boards (from left to right) are 2,3,2,4,3,1. The first and the fifth boards are painted red, the others are painted green. The first and the second boards have contact length 2, the fourth and fifth boards have contact length 3, the fifth and the sixth have contact length 1.

Write a python script for the following problem: Nowadays, most of the internet advertisements are not statically linked to a web page. Instead, what will be shown to the person opening a web page is determined within 100 milliseconds after the web page is opened. Usually, multiple companies compete for each ad slot on the web page in an auction. Each of them receives a request with details about the user, web page and ad slot and they have to respond within those 100 milliseconds with a bid they would pay for putting an advertisement on that ad slot. The company that suggests the highest bid wins the auction and gets to place its advertisement. If there are several companies tied for the highest bid, the winner gets picked at random.\n\nHowever, the company that won the auction does not have to pay the exact amount of its bid. In most of the cases, a second-price auction is used. This means that the amount paid by the company is equal to the maximum of all the other bids placed for this ad slot.\n\nLet's consider one such bidding. There are *n* companies competing for placing an ad. The *i*-th of these companies will bid an integer number of microdollars equiprobably randomly chosen from the range between *L**i* and *R**i*, inclusive. In the other words, the value of the *i*-th company bid can be any integer from the range [*L**i*,<=*R**i*] with the same probability. \n\nDetermine the expected value that the winner will have to pay in a second-price auction.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains an integer number *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=5). *n* lines follow, the *i*-th of them containing two numbers *L**i* and *R**i* (1<=\u2264<=*L**i*<=\u2264<=*R**i*<=\u2264<=10000) describing the *i*-th company's bid preferences.\n\nThis problem doesn't have subproblems. You will get 8 points for the correct submission.. Output specification: Output the answer with absolute or relative error no more than 1*e*<=-<=9.\nDemo input: ['3\\n4 7\\n8 10\\n5 5\\n', '3\\n2 5\\n3 4\\n1 6\\n'], Demo output: ['5.7500000000\\n', '3.5000000000\\n']\nNote: Consider the first example. The first company bids a random integer number of microdollars in range [4,\u20097]; the second company bids between 8 and 10, and the third company bids 5 microdollars. The second company will win regardless of the exact value it bids, however the price it will pay depends on the value of first company's bid. With probability 0.5 the first company will bid at most 5 microdollars, and the second-highest price of the whole auction will be 5. With probability 0.25 it will bid 6 microdollars, and with probability 0.25 it will bid 7 microdollars. Thus, the expected value the second company will have to pay is 0.5\u00b75\u2009+\u20090.25\u00b76\u2009+\u20090.25\u00b77\u2009=\u20095.75."}]}}

Each character can either be a \".\" (dot), or an \"*\" (asterisk). A character equals \"*\" if the corresponding district has been robbed. Otherwise, it equals \".\".\n\nIt is guaranteed that the map has exactly three characters \"*\" and we can always find the fourth district that meets the problem requirements.. Output specification: Print two integers \u2014 the number of the row and the number of the column of the city district that is the fourth one to be robbed.

Initially all the letters of the word are hidden.\n\nThe game consists of several turns. At each turn the participant tells a letter and the TV show host responds if there is such letter in the word or not. If there is such letter then the host reveals all such letters.

A photographic rifle is obviously for Sharic who loves hunting and fish is for Matroskin, but for whom was a new video game console meant? Every one of the three friends claimed that the present is for him and nearly quarreled. Uncle Fyodor had an idea how to solve the problem justly: they should suppose that the console was sent to all three of them and play it in turns. Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up \u2014 who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that\u2019s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player wins.

The dogs are numbered from 1 to *n*. The cost of change for dog *i* is *v**i* RMB. By the way, this technique needs a kind of medicine which can be valid for only one day. So the experiment should be taken in one day and each dog can be changed at most once.\n\nThis experiment has aroused extensive attention from all sectors of society. There are *m* rich folks which are suspicious of this experiment. They all want to bet with SmallR forcibly. If SmallR succeeds, the *i*-th rich folk will pay SmallR *w**i* RMB. But it's strange that they have a special method to determine whether SmallR succeeds. For *i*-th rich folk, in advance, he will appoint certain *k**i* dogs and certain one gender. He will think SmallR succeeds if and only if on some day the *k**i* appointed dogs are all of the appointed gender. Otherwise, he will think SmallR fails.\n\nIf SmallR can't satisfy some folk that isn't her friend, she need not pay him, but if someone she can't satisfy is her good friend, she must pay *g* RMB to him as apologies for her fail.\n\nThen, SmallR hope to acquire money as much as possible by this experiment.

The education is not easy because you need to have fundamental knowledge in different areas, which sometimes are not related to each other. \n\nFor example, you should know linguistics very well. You learn a structure of Reberland language as foreign language. In this language words are constructed according to the following rules. First you need to choose the \"root\" of the word \u2014 some string which has more than 4 letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3 symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction \u2014  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row. All these strings are considered to be suffixes of the word (this time we use word \"suffix\" to describe a morpheme but not the few last characters of the string as you may used to). \n\nHere is one exercise that you have found in your task list. You are given the word *s*. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language. \n\nTwo strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match. \n\nLet's look at the example: the word *abacabaca* is given. This word can be obtained in the following ways: , where the root of the word is overlined, and suffixes are marked by \"corners\". Thus, the set of possible suffixes for this word is {*aca*,<=*ba*,<=*ca*}.\nInput specification: The only line contains a string *s* (5<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=104) consisting of lowercase English letters..

In other words, Pasha can send his solution at some moment *T* iff there exists a period *x* such that *l**x*<=\u2264<=*T*<=\u2264<=*r**x*.\n\nPasha wants to know his best possible result. We need to tell him the minimal moment of time by which he is able to have solutions to all problems submitted, if he acts optimally, or say that it's impossible no matter how Pasha solves the problems.\nInput specification: The first line contains one integer *n*\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the number of problems. The second line contains *n* integers *a**i*\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the time Pasha needs to solve *i*th problem.\n\nThe third line contains one integer *m*\u00a0(0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the number of periods of time when the website is working. Next *m* lines represent these periods. *j*th line contains two numbers *l**j* and *r**j*\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*l**j*<=&lt;<=*r**j*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the starting and the ending moment of *j*th period.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the periods are not intersecting and are given in chronological order, so for every *j*<=&gt;<=1 the condition *l**j*<=&gt;<=*r**j*<=-<=1 is met.. Output specification: If Pasha can solve and submit all the problems before the end of the contest, print the minimal moment of time by which he can have all the solutions submitted.\n\nOtherwise print \"-1\" (without brackets).\nDemo input: ['2\\n3 4\\n2\\n1 4\\n7 9\\n', '1\\n5\\n1\\n1 4\\n', '1\\n5\\n1\\n1 5\\n'], Demo output: ['7\\n', '-1\\n', '5\\n']\nNote: In the first example Pasha can act like this: he solves the second problem in 4 units of time and sends it immediately. Then he spends 3 time units to solve the first problem and sends it 7 time units after the contest starts, because at this moment the website starts working again.\n\nIn the second example Pasha invents the solution only after the website stops working for the last time.\n\nIn the third example Pasha sends the solution exactly at the end of the first period."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: The Happy Farm 5 creators decided to invent the mechanism of cow grazing. The cows in the game are very slow and they move very slowly, it can even be considered that they stand still. However, carnivores should always be chased off them. \n\nFor that a young player Vasya decided to make the shepherd run round the cows along one and the same closed path. It is very important that the cows stayed strictly inside the area limited by the path, as otherwise some cows will sooner or later be eaten. To be absolutely sure in the cows' safety, Vasya wants the path completion time to be minimum.\n\nThe new game is launched for different devices, including mobile phones. That's why the developers decided to quit using the arithmetics with the floating decimal point and use only the arithmetics of integers. The cows and the shepherd in the game are represented as points on the plane with integer coordinates. The playing time is modeled by the turns. During every turn the shepherd can either stay where he stands or step in one of eight directions: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. As the coordinates should always remain integer, then the length of a horizontal and vertical step is equal to 1, and the length of a diagonal step is equal to . The cows do not move. You have to minimize the number of moves the shepherd needs to run round the whole herd.\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer *N* which represents the number of cows in the herd (1<=\u2264<=*N*<=\u2264<=105). Each of the next *N* lines contains two integers *X**i* and *Y**i* which represent the coordinates of one cow of (|*X**i*|,<=|*Y**i*|<=\u2264<=106). Several cows can stand on one point..

Each project (keep in mind that it is determined by both its name and version) might depend on other projects. For sure, there are no cyclic dependencies.\n\nYou're given a list of project descriptions. The first of the given projects is the one being developed by Polycarp at this moment. Help Polycarp determine all projects that his project depends on (directly or via a certain chain). \n\nIt's possible that Polycarp's project depends on two different versions of some project. In this case collision resolving is applied, i.e. for each such project the system chooses the version that minimizes the distance from it to Polycarp's project. If there are several options, the newer (with the maximum version) is preferred. This version is considered actual; other versions and their dependencies are ignored.\n\nMore formal, choose such a set of projects of minimum possible size that the following conditions hold: \n -  Polycarp's project is chosen; -  Polycarp's project depends (directly or indirectly) on all other projects in the set; -  no two projects share the name; -  for each project *x* that some other project in the set depends on we have either *x* or some *y* with other version and shorter chain to Polycarp's project chosen.

Each pair represents coordinates of one vertex of the square. Coordinates within each line are either in clockwise or counterclockwise order.\n\nThe first line contains the coordinates of the square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the second line contains the coordinates of the square at 45 degrees.\n\nAll the values are integer and between $-100$ and $100$.. Output specification: Print \"Yes\" if squares intersect, otherwise print \"No\".\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\nDemo input: ['0 0 6 0 6 6 0 6\\n1 3 3 5 5 3 3 1\\n', '0 0 6 0 6 6 0 6\\n7 3 9 5 11 3 9 1\\n', '6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0\\n7 4 4 7 7 10 10 7\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n', 'YES\\n']\nNote: In the first example the second square lies entirely within the first square, so they do intersect.\n\nIn the second sample squares do not have any points in common.\n\nHere are images corresponding to the samples:"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Polycarp likes numbers that are divisible by 3.\n\nHe has a huge number $s$. Polycarp wants to cut from it the maximum number of numbers that are divisible by $3$. To do this, he makes an arbitrary number of vertical cuts between pairs of adjacent digits. As a result, after $m$ such cuts, there will be $m+1$ parts in total. Polycarp analyzes each of the obtained numbers and finds the number of those that are divisible by $3$.\n\nFor example, if the original number is $s=3121$, then Polycarp can cut it into three parts with two cuts: $3|1|21$. As a result, he will get two numbers that are divisible by $3$.\n\nPolycarp can make an arbitrary number of vertical cuts, where each cut is made between a pair of adjacent digits.

As the lecture was boring, Vasya decided to complete the picture by composing a graph *G* with the following properties: \n -  *G* has exactly *n* vertices, numbered from 1 to *n*. -  For all pairs of vertices *i* and *j*, where *i*<=\u2260<=*j*, there is an edge connecting them if and only if characters *s**i* and *s**j* are either equal or neighbouring in the alphabet. That is, letters in pairs \"a\"-\"b\" and \"b\"-\"c\" are neighbouring, while letters \"a\"-\"c\" are not. \nVasya painted the resulting graph near the string and then erased the string. Next day Vasya's friend Petya came to a lecture and found some graph at his desk. He had heard of Vasya's adventure and now he wants to find out whether it could be the original graph *G*, painted by Vasya. In order to verify this, Petya needs to know whether there exists a string *s*, such that if Vasya used this *s* he would produce the given graph *G*.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* \u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices and edges in the graph found by Petya, respectively.\n\nEach of the next *m* lines contains two integers *u**i* and *v**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*u**i*<=\u2260<=*v**i*)\u00a0\u2014 the edges of the graph *G*.

The wires run along the floor from the wall (on the left) to the device (on the right). Both the wall and the device have two contacts in them on the same level, into which the wires are plugged in some order. The wires are considered entangled if there are one or more places where one wire runs above the other one. For example, the picture below has four such places (top view):\n\nMike knows the sequence in which the wires run above each other. Mike also noticed that on the left side, the \"plus\" wire is always plugged into the top contact (as seen on the picture).

Thus the wires cannot be untangled: \n\nIn the third testcase the \"plus\" wire simply runs above the \"minus\" wire twice in sequence.

By these years you have developed a good tradition \u2014 when it rains, you go on the street and stay silent for a moment, contemplate all around you, enjoy freshness, think about big deeds you have to do. \n\nToday everything had changed quietly. You went on the street with a cup contained water, your favorite drink. In a moment when you were drinking a water you noticed that the process became quite long: the cup still contained water because of rain. You decided to make a formal model of what was happening and to find if it was possible to drink all water in that situation. \n\nThus, your cup is a cylinder with diameter equals *d* centimeters. Initial level of water in cup equals *h* centimeters from the bottom. \n\nYou drink a water with a speed equals *v* milliliters per second. But rain goes with such speed that if you do not drink a water from the cup, the level of water increases on *e* centimeters per second. The process of drinking water from the cup and the addition of rain to the cup goes evenly and continuously. \n\nFind the time needed to make the cup empty or find that it will never happen. It is guaranteed that if it is possible to drink all water, it will happen not later than after 104 seconds.\n\nNote one milliliter equals to one cubic centimeter.\nInput specification: The only line of the input contains four integer numbers *d*,<=*h*,<=*v*,<=*e* (1<=\u2264<=*d*,<=*h*,<=*v*,<=*e*<=\u2264<=104), where:\n -  *d* \u2014 the diameter of your cylindrical cup, -  *h* \u2014 the initial level of water in the cup, -  *v* \u2014 the speed of drinking process from the cup in milliliters per second, -  *e* \u2014 the growth of water because of rain if you do not drink from the cup..

In the second line print a real number \u2014 time in seconds needed the cup will be empty. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10<=-<=4. It is guaranteed that if the answer exists, it doesn't exceed 104.\nDemo input: ['1 2 3 100\\n', '1 1 1 1\\n'], Demo output: ['NO\\n', 'YES\\n3.659792366325\\n']\nNote: In the first example the water fills the cup faster than you can drink from it.\n\nIn the second example area of the cup's bottom equals to <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/419dc74dcd7bc392019c9fe748fe1fdb08ab521a.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, thus we can conclude that you decrease the level of water by <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/e8edb237e1f805fe83c2f47e48d3a9d03f2ee304.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> centimeters per second.

There are more ways to shorten zeroes in this IPv6 address.\n\nSome IPv6 addresses contain long sequences of zeroes. Continuous sequences of 16-bit zero blocks can be shortened to \"::\". A sequence can consist of one or several consecutive blocks, with all 16 bits equal to 0. \n\nYou can see examples of zero block shortenings below:\n -  \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:0000:0000:0000\" <=\u2192<= \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001::\"; -  \"a56f:0000:0000:0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\" <=\u2192<= \"a56f::0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\"; -  \"a56f:0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\" <=\u2192<= \"a56f:0000::0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\"; -  \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:0000:0000:0000\" <=\u2192<= \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001::0000\"; -  \"0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000\" <=\u2192<= \"::\". \nIt is not allowed to shorten zero blocks in the address more than once. This means that the short record can't contain the sequence of characters \"::\" more than once. Otherwise, it will sometimes be impossible to determine the number of zero blocks, each represented by a double colon.\n\nThe format of the record of the IPv6 address after removing the leading zeroes and shortening the zero blocks is called short.\n\nYou've got several short records of IPv6 addresses. Restore their full record.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* \u2014 the number of records to restore (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100).\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains a string \u2014 the short IPv6 addresses. Each string only consists of string characters \"0123456789abcdef:\".\n\nIt is guaranteed that each short address is obtained by the way that is described in the statement from some full IPv6 address.. Output specification: For each short IPv6 address from the input print its full record on a separate line. Print the full records for the short IPv6 addresses in the order, in which the short records follow in the input.\nDemo input: ['6\\na56f:d3:0:0124:01:f19a:1000:00\\na56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001::\\na56f::0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\\na56f:0000::0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\\n::\\n0ea::4d:f4:6:0\\n'], Demo output: ['a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:f19a:1000:0000\\na56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:0000:0000:0000\\na56f:0000:0000:0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\\na56f:0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\\n0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000\\n00ea:0000:0000:0000:004d:00f4:0006:0000\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Set *A* is connected. Your task is to find the minimum number of squares that we can delete from set *A* to make it not connected.\n\nA set of painted squares is called connected, if for every two squares *a* and *b* from this set there is a sequence of squares from the set, beginning in *a* and ending in *b*, such that in this sequence any square, except for the last one, shares a common side with the square that follows next in the sequence.
