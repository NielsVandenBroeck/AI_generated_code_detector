She hopes that you will help her one more time with that.\n\nThe box's lock looks as follows: it contains 4 identical deepenings for gems as a 2<=\u00d7<=2 square, and some integer numbers are written at the lock's edge near the deepenings. The example of a lock is given on the picture below.\n\nThe box is accompanied with 9 gems. Their shapes match the deepenings' shapes and each gem contains one number from 1 to 9 (each number is written on exactly one gem). The box will only open after it is decorated with gems correctly: that is, each deepening in the lock should be filled with exactly one gem. Also, the sums of numbers in the square's rows, columns and two diagonals of the square should match the numbers written at the lock's edge. For example, the above lock will open if we fill the deepenings with gems with numbers as is shown on the picture below.\n\nNow Vasilisa the Wise wants to define, given the numbers on the box's lock, which gems she should put in the deepenings to open the box. Help Vasilisa to solve this challenging task.\nInput specification: The input contains numbers written on the edges of the lock of the box. The first line contains space-separated integers *r*1 and *r*2 that define the required sums of numbers in the rows of the square. The second line contains space-separated integers *c*1 and *c*2 that define the required sums of numbers in the columns of the square. The third line contains space-separated integers *d*1 and *d*2 that define the required sums of numbers on the main and on the side diagonals of the square (1<=\u2264<=*r*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*1,<=*c*2,<=*d*1,<=*d*2<=\u2264<=20). Correspondence between the above 6 variables and places where they are written is shown on the picture below. For more clarifications please look at the second sample test that demonstrates the example given in the problem statement.. Output specification: Print the scheme of decorating the box with stones: two lines containing two space-separated integers from 1 to 9. The numbers should be pairwise different. If there is no solution for the given lock, then print the single number \"-1\" (without the quotes).\n\nIf there are several solutions, output any.\nDemo input: ['3 7\\n4 6\\n5 5\\n', '11 10\\n13 8\\n5 16\\n', '1 2\\n3 4\\n5 6\\n', '10 10\\n10 10\\n10 10\\n'], Demo output: ['1 2\\n3 4\\n', '4 7\\n9 1\\n', '-1\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: Pay attention to the last test from the statement: it is impossible to open the box because for that Vasilisa the Wise would need 4 identical gems containing number \"5\". However, Vasilisa only has one gem with each number from 1 to 9."}]}}

Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24.

The only limitation that Vasya has \u2014 he does not want to do the same activity on two consecutive days: it means, he will not do sport on two consecutive days, and write the contest on two consecutive days.\nInput specification: The first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of days of Vasya's vacations.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence of integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=3) separated by space, where: \n -  *a**i* equals 0, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is closed and the contest is not carried out; -  *a**i* equals 1, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is closed, but the contest is carried out; -  *a**i* equals 2, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is open and the contest is not carried out; -  *a**i* equals 3, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is open and the contest is carried out.. Output specification: Print the minimum possible number of days on which Vasya will have a rest. Remember that Vasya refuses:\n -  to do sport on any two consecutive days, -  to write the contest on any two consecutive days.\nDemo input: ['4\\n1 3 2 0\\n', '7\\n1 3 3 2 1 2 3\\n', '2\\n2 2\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '0\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: In the first test Vasya can write the contest on the day number 1 and do sport on the day number 3. Thus, he will have a rest for only 2 days.\n\nIn the second test Vasya should write contests on days number 1, 3, 5 and 7, in other days do sport. Thus, he will not have a rest for a single day.\n\nIn the third test Vasya can do sport either on a day number 1 or number 2. He can not do sport in two days, because it will be contrary to the his limitation. Thus, he will have a rest for only one day."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: After the big birthday party, Katie still wanted Shiro to have some more fun. Later, she came up with a game called treasure hunt. Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\n\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.. Output specification: Print the name of the winner (\"Kuro\", \"Shiro\" or \"Katie\"). If there are at least two cats that share the maximum beauty, print \"Draw\".\nDemo input: ['3\\nKuroo\\nShiro\\nKatie\\n', '7\\ntreasurehunt\\nthreefriends\\nhiCodeforces\\n', '1\\nabcabc\\ncbabac\\nababca\\n', '15\\nfoPaErcvJ\\nmZaxowpbt\\nmkuOlaHRE\\n'], Demo output: ['Kuro\\n', 'Shiro\\n', 'Katie\\n', 'Draw\\n']\nNote: In the first example, after $3$ turns, Kuro can change his ribbon into ooooo, which has the beauty of $5$, while reaching such beauty for Shiro and Katie is impossible (both Shiro and Katie can reach the beauty of at most $4$, for example by changing Shiro's ribbon into SSiSS and changing Katie's ribbon into Kaaaa). Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice. Therefore, the game ends in a draw."}]}}

As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed.

Write a python script for the following problem: There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: \n -  alloc n \u2014 to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; \nThe memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.\n\nThe first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.\nInput specification: The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100;1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *t* \u2014 the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* \u2014 the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.. Output specification: Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession.

Write a python script for the following problem: The research center Q has developed a new multi-core processor. The processor consists of *n* cores and has *k* cells of cache memory. Consider the work of this processor.\n\nAt each cycle each core of the processor gets one instruction: either do nothing, or the number of the memory cell (the core will write an information to the cell). After receiving the command, the core executes it immediately. Sometimes it happens that at one cycle, multiple cores try to write the information into a single cell. Unfortunately, the developers did not foresee the possibility of resolving conflicts between cores, so in this case there is a deadlock: all these cores and the corresponding memory cell are locked forever. Each of the locked cores ignores all further commands, and no core in the future will be able to record an information into the locked cell. If any of the cores tries to write an information into some locked cell, it is immediately locked.\n\nThe development team wants to explore the deadlock situation. Therefore, they need a program that will simulate the processor for a given set of instructions for each core within *m* cycles . You're lucky, this interesting work is entrusted to you. According to the instructions, during the *m* cycles define for each core the number of the cycle, during which it will become locked. It is believed that initially all cores and all memory cells are not locked.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=100). Then follow *n* lines describing instructions. The *i*-th line contains *m* integers: *x**i*1,<=*x**i*2,<=...,<=*x**im* (0<=\u2264<=*x**ij*<=\u2264<=*k*), where *x**ij* is the instruction that must be executed by the *i*-th core at the *j*-th cycle. If *x**ij* equals 0, then the corresponding instruction is \u00abdo nothing\u00bb. But if *x**ij* is a number from 1 to *k*, then the corresponding instruction is \u00abwrite information to the memory cell number *x**ij*\u00bb.\n\nWe assume that the cores are numbered from 1 to *n*, the work cycles are numbered from 1 to *m* and the memory cells are numbered from 1 to *k*.. Output specification: Print *n* lines. In the *i*-th line print integer *t**i*.

Write a python script for the following problem: Allen dreams of one day owning a enormous fleet of electric cars, the car of the future! He knows that this will give him a big status boost. As Allen is planning out all of the different types of cars he will own and how he will arrange them, he realizes that he has a problem. \n\nAllen's future parking lot can be represented as a rectangle with $4$ rows and $n$ ($n \\le 50$) columns of rectangular spaces, each of which can contain at most one car at any time. He imagines having $k$ ($k \\le 2n$) cars in the grid, and all the cars are initially in the second and third rows. Each of the cars also has a different designated parking space in the first or fourth row. Allen has to put the cars into corresponding parking places.\n\nHowever, since Allen would never entrust his cars to anyone else, only one car can be moved at a time. He can drive a car from a space in any of the four cardinal directions to a neighboring empty space. Furthermore, Allen can only move one of his cars into a space on the first or fourth rows if it is the car's designated parking space. \n\nAllen knows he will be a very busy man, and will only have time to move cars at most $20000$ times before he realizes that moving cars is not worth his time. Help Allen determine if he should bother parking his cars or leave it to someone less important.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$, $1 \\le k \\le 2n$), representing the number of columns and the number of cars, respectively.\n\nThe next four lines will contain $n$ integers each between $0$ and $k$ inclusive, representing the initial state of the parking lot. The rows are numbered $1$ to $4$ from top to bottom and the columns are numbered $1$ to $n$ from left to right.\n\nIn the first and last line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents a parking spot assigned to car $x$ (you can only move this car to this place), while the integer $0$ represents a empty space (you can't move any car to this place).\n\nIn the second and third line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents initial position of car $x$, while the integer $0$ represents an empty space (you can move any car to this place).\n\nEach $x$ between $1$ and $k$ appears exactly once in the second and third line, and exactly once in the first and fourth line.. Output specification: If there is a sequence of moves that brings all of the cars to their parking spaces, with at most $20000$ car moves, then print $m$, the number of moves, on the first line. On the following $m$ lines, print the moves (one move per line) in the format $i$ $r$ $c$, which corresponds to Allen moving car $i$ to the neighboring space at row $r$ and column $c$.\n\nIf it is not possible for Allen to move all the cars to the correct spaces with at most $20000$ car moves, print a single line with the integer $-1$.\nDemo input: ['4 5\\n1 2 0 4\\n1 2 0 4\\n5 0 0 3\\n0 5 0 3\\n', '1 2\\n1\\n2\\n1\\n2\\n', '1 2\\n1\\n1\\n2\\n2\\n'], Demo output: ['6\\n1 1 1\\n2 1 2\\n4 1 4\\n3 4 4\\n5 3 2\\n5 4 2\\n', '-1\\n', '2\\n1 1 1\\n2 4 1\\n']\nNote: In the first sample test case, all cars are in front of their spots except car $5$, which is in front of the parking spot adjacent. The example shows the shortest possible sequence of moves, but any sequence of length at most $20000$ will be accepted.\n\nIn the second sample test case, there is only one column, and the cars are in the wrong order, so no cars can move and the task is impossible."}]}}

Okabe can select a single rectangle with axis aligned sides with all points on or under the line and cut all the trees in all points that are inside or on the border of this rectangle and take their bananas. Okabe's rectangle can be degenerate; that is, it can be a line segment or even a point.\n\nHelp Okabe and find the maximum number of bananas he can get if he chooses the rectangle wisely.\n\nOkabe is sure that the answer does not exceed 1018. You can trust him.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains two space-separated integers *m* and *b* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000, 1<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=10000).. Output specification: Print the maximum number of bananas Okabe can get from the trees he cuts.\nDemo input: ['1 5\\n', '2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['30\\n', '25\\n']\nNote: The graph above corresponds to sample test 1. The optimal rectangle is shown in red and has 30 bananas."}]}}

For example, *lowbit*(100102)<==<=102,<=*lowbit*(100012)<==<=12,<=*lowbit*(100002)<==<=100002 (binary representation). \nCan you help Picks and find any set *S*, that satisfies all the above conditions?\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers: *sum*,<=*limit* (1<=\u2264<=*sum*,<=*limit*<=\u2264<=105).. Output specification: In the first line print an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105), denoting the size of *S*. Then print the elements of set *S* in any order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nIf it's impossible to find a suitable set, print -1.\nDemo input: ['5 5\\n', '4 3\\n', '5 1\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n4 5\\n', '3\\n2 3 1\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: In sample test 1: *lowbit*(4)\u2009=\u20094,\u2009*lowbit*(5)\u2009=\u20091,\u20094\u2009+\u20091\u2009=\u20095.\n\nIn sample test 2: *lowbit*(1)\u2009=\u20091,\u2009*lowbit*(2)\u2009=\u20092,\u2009*lowbit*(3)\u2009=\u20091,\u20091\u2009+\u20092\u2009+\u20091\u2009=\u20094."}]}}

However, many of Vasya's fellow students from the same group were more successful and celebrated after the exam.\n\nSome of them celebrated in the BugDonalds restaurant, some of them\u00a0\u2014 in the BeaverKing restaurant, the most successful ones were fast enough to celebrate in both of restaurants. Students which didn't pass the exam didn't celebrate in any of those restaurants and elected to stay home to prepare for their reexamination. However, this quickly bored Vasya and he started checking celebration photos on the Kilogramm. He found out that, in total, BugDonalds was visited by $A$ students, BeaverKing\u00a0\u2014 by $B$ students and $C$ students visited both restaurants. Vasya also knows that there are $N$ students in his group.\n\nBased on this info, Vasya wants to determine either if his data contradicts itself or, if it doesn't, how many students in his group didn't pass the exam.

You should purify all of these cells.\n\nThe only method of tile purification known to you is by casting the \"Purification\" spell. You cast this spell on a single tile \u2014 then, all cells that are located in the same row and all cells that are located in the same column as the selected tile become purified (including the selected tile)! It is allowed to purify a cell more than once.\n\nYou would like to purify all *n*<=\u00d7<=*n* cells while minimizing the number of times you cast the \"Purification\" spell. This sounds very easy, but you just noticed that some tiles are particularly more evil than the other tiles. You cannot cast the \"Purification\" spell on those particularly more evil tiles, not even after they have been purified. They can still be purified if a cell sharing the same row or the same column gets selected by the \"Purification\" spell.\n\nPlease find some way to purify all the cells with the minimum number of spells cast.

It's known that any two computers connected by cable directly or through other computers\n\nPolycarpus decided to find out the network's topology. A network topology is the way of describing the network configuration, the scheme that shows the location and the connections of network devices.\n\nPolycarpus knows three main network topologies: bus, ring and star. A bus is the topology that represents a shared cable with all computers connected with it. In the ring topology the cable connects each computer only with two other ones. A star is the topology where all computers of a network are connected to the single central node.\n\nLet's represent each of these network topologies as a connected non-directed graph. A bus is a connected graph that is the only path, that is, the graph where all nodes are connected with two other ones except for some two nodes that are the beginning and the end of the path. A ring is a connected graph, where all nodes are connected with two other ones. A star is a connected graph, where a single central node is singled out and connected with all other nodes. For clarifications, see the picture.\n\nYou've got a connected non-directed graph that characterizes the computer network in Polycarpus' corporation.

In case if player dice values are equal, no one of them is a winner.\n\nIn average, player, who won most of the rounds, is the winner of the game. In case if two players won the same number of rounds, the result of the game is draw.\n\nMishka is still very little and can't count wins and losses, so she asked you to watch their game and determine its result. Please help her!\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains single integer *n* *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of game rounds.\n\nThe next *n* lines contains rounds description. *i*-th of them contains pair of integers *m**i* and *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*m**i*,<=<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=6)\u00a0\u2014 values on dice upper face after Mishka's and Chris' throws in *i*-th round respectively.. Output specification: If Mishka is the winner of the game, print \"Mishka\" (without quotes) in the only line.\n\nIf Chris is the winner of the game, print \"Chris\" (without quotes) in the only line.\n\nIf the result of the game is draw, print \"Friendship is magic!^^\" (without quotes) in the only line.\nDemo input: ['3\\n3 5\\n2 1\\n4 2\\n', '2\\n6 1\\n1 6\\n', '3\\n1 5\\n3 3\\n2 2\\n'], Demo output: ['Mishka', 'Friendship is magic!^^', 'Chris']\nNote: In the first sample case Mishka loses the first round, but wins second and third rounds and thus she is the winner of the game.\n\nIn the second sample case Mishka wins the first round, Chris wins the second round, and the game ends with draw with score 1:1.\n\nIn the third sample case Chris wins the first round, but there is no winner of the next two rounds. The winner of the game is Chris."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Vitya loves programming and problem solving, but sometimes, to distract himself a little, he plays computer games. Once he found a new interesting game about tanks, and he liked it so much that he went through almost all levels in one day. Remained only the last level, which was too tricky. Then Vitya remembered that he is a programmer, and wrote a program that helped him to pass this difficult level. Try do the same.\n\nThe game is organized as follows. There is a long road, two cells wide and *n* cells long. Some cells have obstacles. You control a tank that occupies one cell. Initially, the tank is located before the start of the road, in a cell with coordinates (0,<=1). Your task is to move the tank to the end of the road, to the cell (*n*<=+<=1,<=1) or (*n*<=+<=1,<=2).\n\nEvery second the tank moves one cell to the right: the coordinate *x* is increased by one. When you press the up or down arrow keys, the tank instantly changes the lane, that is, the *y* coordinate. When you press the spacebar, the tank shoots, and the nearest obstacle along the lane in which the tank rides is instantly destroyed. In order to load a gun, the tank needs *t* seconds. Initially, the gun is not loaded, that means, the first shot can be made only after *t* seconds after the tank starts to move.\n\nIf at some point the tank is in the same cell with an obstacle not yet destroyed, it burns out. If you press the arrow exactly at the moment when the tank moves forward, the tank will first move forward, and then change the lane, so it will not be possible to move diagonally.\n\nYour task is to find out whether it is possible to pass the level, and if possible, to find the order of actions the player need to make.\nInput specification: The first line contains four integers *n*, *m*1, *m*2 and *t*, the length of the field, the number of obstacles in the first lane, the number of obstacles in the second lane and the number of tank steps before reloading, respectively (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=109; 0<=\u2264<=*m*1,<=*m*2<=\u2264<=*n*; 0<=\u2264<=*m*1<=+<=*m*2<=\u2264<=106; 1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=*n*).\n\nThe next two lines contain a description of the obstacles. The first of these lines contains *m*1 numbers *x**i* \u2014 the obstacle coordinates in the first lane (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=*n*; *x**i*<=&lt;<=*x**i*<=+<=1). The *y* coordinate for all these obstacles will be 1.\n\nThe second line contains *m*2 numbers describing the obstacles of the second lane in the same format. The *y* coordinate of all these obstacles will be 2.. Output specification: In the first line print \u00abYes\u00bb, if it is possible to pass the level, or \u00abNo\u00bb, otherwise.\n\nIf it is possible, then in the second line print the number of times the tank moves from one lane to another, and in the next line print the coordinates of the transitions, one number per transition: the coordinate *x* (0<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*<=+<=1). All transition coordinates coordinates must be distinct and should be output in strictly increasing order.The number of transitions should not exceed 2\u00b7106. If the tank can pass the level, then it can do it using no more than 2\u00b7106 transitions.\n\nIn the fourth line print the number of shots that the tank makes during the movement, in the following lines print two numbers, *x* and *y* coordinates of the point (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*, 1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=2), from which the tank fired a shot, the number of shots must not exceed *m*1<=+<=*m*2. Shots must be output in the order in which they are fired.\n\nIf there are several solutions, output any one.\nDemo input: ['6 2 3 2\\n2 6\\n3 5 6\\n', '1 1 1 1\\n1\\n1\\n', '9 5 2 5\\n1 2 7 8 9\\n4 6\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n2\\n0 3 \\n2\\n2 2\\n4 1\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n4\\n0 3 5 10 \\n1\\n5 2\\n']\nNote: Picture for the first sample test."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: A bus moves along the coordinate line *Ox* from the point *x*<==<=0 to the point *x*<==<=*a*. After starting from the point *x*<==<=0, it reaches the point *x*<==<=*a*, immediately turns back and then moves to the point *x*<==<=0. After returning to the point *x*<==<=0 it immediately goes back to the point *x*<==<=*a* and so on. Thus, the bus moves from *x*<==<=0 to *x*<==<=*a* and back. Moving from the point *x*<==<=0 to *x*<==<=*a* or from the point *x*<==<=*a* to *x*<==<=0 is called a bus journey. In total, the bus must make *k* journeys.\n\nThe petrol tank of the bus can hold *b* liters of gasoline. To pass a single unit of distance the bus needs to spend exactly one liter of gasoline. The bus starts its first journey with a full petrol tank.\n\nThere is a gas station in point *x*<==<=*f*. This point is between points *x*<==<=0 and *x*<==<=*a*. There are no other gas stations on the bus route. While passing by a gas station in either direction the bus can stop and completely refuel its tank. Thus, after stopping to refuel the tank will contain *b* liters of gasoline.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of times the bus needs to refuel at the point *x*<==<=*f* to make *k* journeys? The first journey starts in the point *x*<==<=0.\nInput specification: The first line contains four integers *a*, *b*, *f*, *k* (0<=&lt;<=*f*<=&lt;<=*a*<=\u2264<=106, 1<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=109, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the endpoint of the first bus journey, the capacity of the fuel tank of the bus, the point where the gas station is located, and the required number of journeys..

So the bus makes the whole first journey, passes 4 units of the distance of the second journey and arrives at the point with the gas station. Then it can refuel its tank, finish the second journey and pass 2 units of distance from the third journey. In this case, it will again arrive at the point with the gas station. Further, he can refill the tank up to 10 liters to finish the third journey and ride all the way of the fourth journey. At the end of the journey the tank will be empty. \n\nIn the third example the bus can not make all 3 journeys because if it refuels during the second journey, the tanks will contain only 5 liters of gasoline, but the bus needs to pass 8 units of distance until next refueling."}]}}

These matrices have exactly one zero, while all other cells have the Manhattan distance to the cell containing the zero. The cells with equal numbers have the form of a rhombus, that is why Sonya called this type so.\n\nThe Manhattan distance between two cells ($x_1$, $y_1$) and ($x_2$, $y_2$) is defined as $|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$. For example, the Manhattan distance between the cells $(5, 2)$ and $(7, 1)$ equals to $|5-7|+|2-1|=3$.\n\nNote that rhombic matrices are uniquely defined by $n$, $m$, and the coordinates of the cell containing the zero.\n\nShe drew a $n\\times m$ rhombic matrix. She believes that you can not recreate the matrix if she gives you only the elements of this matrix in some arbitrary order (i.e., the sequence of $n\\cdot m$ numbers). Note that Sonya will not give you $n$ and $m$, so only the sequence of numbers in this matrix will be at your disposal.\n\nWrite a program that finds such an $n\\times m$ rhombic matrix whose elements are the same as the elements in the sequence in some order.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\\leq t\\leq 10^6$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cells in the matrix.\n\nThe second line contains $t$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_t$ ($0\\leq a_i&lt; t$)\u00a0\u2014 the values in the cells in arbitrary order..

Alice immediately took an orange for herself, Bob took an apple. To make the process of sharing the remaining fruit more fun, the friends decided to play a game. They put multiple cards and on each one they wrote a letter, either 'A', or the letter 'B'. Then they began to remove the cards one by one from left to right, every time they removed a card with the letter 'A', Alice gave Bob all the fruits she had at that moment and took out of the bag as many apples and as many oranges as she had before. Thus the number of oranges and apples Alice had, did not change. If the card had written letter 'B', then Bob did the same, that is, he gave Alice all the fruit that he had, and took from the bag the same set of fruit. After the last card way removed, all the fruit in the bag were over.\n\nYou know how many oranges and apples was in the bag at first.

Naturally, Dima, as all other men who have girlfriends, does everything wrong.\n\nInna and Dima are now in one room. Inna tells Dima off for everything he does in her presence. After Inna tells him off for something, she goes to another room, walks there in circles muttering about how useless her sweetheart is. During that time Dima has time to peacefully complete *k*<=-<=1 tasks. Then Inna returns and tells Dima off for the next task he does in her presence and goes to another room again. It continues until Dima is through with his tasks.\n\nOverall, Dima has *n* tasks to do, each task has a unique number from 1 to *n*. Dima loves order, so he does tasks consecutively, starting from some task. For example, if Dima has 6 tasks to do in total, then, if he starts from the 5-th task, the order is like that: first Dima does the 5-th task, then the 6-th one, then the 1-st one, then the 2-nd one, then the 3-rd one, then the 4-th one.\n\nInna tells Dima off (only lovingly and appropriately!) so often and systematically that he's very well learned the power with which she tells him off for each task.

Thus, Dima gets told off with total power 3 + 1 + 5 = 9. If Dima started from the second task, for example, then Inna would tell him off for tasks 2, 4 and 6 with power 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \n\nExplanation of the second example.\n\nIn the second example *k* = 5, thus, Dima manages to complete 4 tasks in-between the telling off sessions. Thus, Inna tells Dima off for tasks number 1 and 6 (if he starts from 1 or 6), 2 and 7 (if he starts from 2 or 7) and so on.

Write a python script for the following problem: By 2312 there were *n* Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*)..

Having learned the news, the colonel ordered to all *n* squad soldiers to line up on the parade ground.\n\nBy the military charter the soldiers should stand in the order of non-increasing of their height. But as there's virtually no time to do that, the soldiers lined up in the arbitrary order. However, the general is rather short-sighted and he thinks that the soldiers lined up correctly if the first soldier in the line has the maximum height and the last soldier has the minimum height. Please note that the way other solders are positioned does not matter, including the case when there are several soldiers whose height is maximum or minimum. Only the heights of the first and the last soldier are important.\n\nFor example, the general considers the sequence of heights (4, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1) correct and the sequence (4, 3, 1, 2, 2) wrong.\n\nWithin one second the colonel can swap any two neighboring soldiers.

He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.\n\nOne day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.\nInput specification: There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number. It is guaranteed that the numbers are made from 0 and 1 only and that their length is same. The numbers may start with 0. The length of each number doesn't exceed 100..

You can go from the first room to the second room, from the second room to the third room and so on \u2014 you can go from the (*n*<=-<=1)-th room to the *n*-th room. Thus, you can go to room *x* only from room *x*<=-<=1.\n\nThe potato pie is located in the *n*-th room and Vitaly needs to go there. \n\nEach pair of consecutive rooms has a door between them. In order to go to room *x* from room *x*<=-<=1, you need to open the door between the rooms with the corresponding key. \n\nIn total the house has several types of doors (represented by uppercase Latin letters) and several types of keys (represented by lowercase Latin letters). The key of type *t* can open the door of type *T* if and only if *t* and *T* are the same letter, written in different cases. For example, key f can open door F.\n\nEach of the first *n*<=-<=1 rooms contains exactly one key of some type that Vitaly can use to get to next rooms. Once the door is open with some key, Vitaly won't get the key from the keyhole but he will immediately run into the next room. In other words, each key can open no more than one door.\n\nVitaly realizes that he may end up in some room without the key that opens the door to the next room. Before the start his run for the potato pie Vitaly can buy any number of keys of any type that is guaranteed to get to room *n*.\n\nGiven the plan of the house, Vitaly wants to know what is the minimum number of keys he needs to buy to surely get to the room *n*, which has a delicious potato pie. Write a program that will help Vitaly find out this number.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains a positive integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the number of rooms in the house.\n\nThe second line of the input contains string *s* of length 2\u00b7*n*<=-<=2.

Thus, each odd position *i* of the given string *s* contains a lowercase Latin letter \u2014 the type of the key that lies in room number (*i*<=+<=1)<=/<=2.\n\nThe even positions in the given string contain uppercase Latin letters \u2014 the types of doors between the rooms. Thus, each even position *i* of the given string *s* contains an uppercase letter \u2014 the type of the door that leads from room *i*<=/<=2 to room *i*<=/<=2<=+<=1..

A field is represented by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*) \u2014 the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:\n -  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically. -  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally. -  A king moves one field in any direction \u2014 horizontally, vertically or diagonally. \nPetya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2)?

Please note, that you can do up to 15 ask queries and one answer query. -  Your final answer is not correct. \nIf you exceed the maximum number of queries, You should terminate with 0, In this case you'll get Wrong Answer, If you don't terminate you may receive any verdict because you'll be reading from a closed stream .\nInput specification: The first line of input will contain a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the hidden binary string.. Output specification: To print the final answer, print \"! pos0 pos1\" (without quotes), where *pos*0 and *pos*1 are positions of some '0' and some '1' in the string (the string is 1-indexed). Don't forget to flush the output after printing the answer!\nDemo input: ['3\\n2\\n1\\n3\\n2\\n1\\n0'], Demo output: ['? 000\\n? 001\\n? 010\\n? 011\\n? 100\\n? 101\\n! 2 1']\nNote: Hamming distance definition: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)\n\nIn the first test case the hidden binary string is 101, The first query is 000, so the Hamming distance is 2. In the second query the hidden string is still 101 and query is 001, so the Hamming distance is 1.\n\nAfter some queries you find that symbol at position 2 is '0' and symbol at position 1 is '1', so you print \"! 2 1\"."}]}}

He has even invented a new variant of chess, which he named \u00abPawnChess\u00bb.\n\nThis new game is played on a board consisting of 8 rows and 8 columns. At the beginning of every game some black and white pawns are placed on the board. The number of black pawns placed is not necessarily equal to the number of white pawns placed. \n\nLets enumerate rows and columns with integers from 1 to 8. Rows are numbered from top to bottom, while columns are numbered from left to right. Now we denote as (*r*,<=*c*) the cell located at the row *r* and at the column *c*.\n\nThere are always two players A and B playing the game. Player A plays with white pawns, while player B plays with black ones. The goal of player A is to put any of his pawns to the row 1, while player B tries to put any of his pawns to the row 8. As soon as any of the players completes his goal the game finishes immediately and the succeeded player is declared a winner.\n\nPlayer A moves first and then they alternate turns. On his move player A must choose exactly one white pawn and move it one step upward and player B (at his turn) must choose exactly one black pawn and move it one step down. Any move is possible only if the targeted cell is empty. It's guaranteed that for any scenario of the game there will always be at least one move available for any of the players.\n\nMoving upward means that the pawn located in (*r*,<=*c*) will go to the cell (*r*<=-<=1,<=*c*), while moving down means the pawn located in (*r*,<=*c*) will go to the cell (*r*<=+<=1,<=*c*). Again, the corresponding cell must be empty, i.e. not occupied by any other pawn of any color.\n\nGiven the initial disposition of the board, determine who wins the game if both players play optimally. Note that there will always be a winner due to the restriction that for any game scenario both players will have some moves available.\nInput specification: The input consists of the board description given in eight lines, each line contains eight characters. Character 'B' is used to denote a black pawn, and character 'W' represents a white pawn. Empty cell is marked with '.'. \n\nIt's guaranteed that there will not be white pawns on the first row neither black pawns on the last row.. Output specification: Print 'A' if player A wins the game on the given board, and 'B' if player B will claim the victory. Again, it's guaranteed that there will always be a winner on the given board.\nDemo input: ['........\\n........\\n.B....B.\\n....W...\\n........\\n..W.....\\n........\\n........\\n', '..B.....\\n..W.....\\n......B.\\n........\\n.....W..\\n......B.\\n........\\n........\\n'], Demo output: ['A\\n', 'B\\n']\nNote: In the first sample player A is able to complete his goal in 3 steps by always moving a pawn initially located at (4,\u20095). Player B needs at least 5 steps for any of his pawns to reach the row 8. Hence, player A will be the winner."}]}}

If there is no such *k*, print 0.\nInput specification: The first line contains single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of strings. The next *n* lines contain strings *s*1,<=*s*2,<=...,<=*s**n* (1<=\u2264<=|*s**i*|<=\u2264<=100), one per line. The total length of strings is not greater than 100.\n\nThe next line contains single integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of operations. *m* lines follow, each of them contains two integers *a**i* abd *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=+<=*i*<=-<=1)\u00a0\u2014 the number of strings that are concatenated to form *s**n*<=+<=*i*.. Output specification: Print *m* lines, each should contain one integer\u00a0\u2014 the answer to the question after the corresponding operation.\nDemo input: ['5\\n01\\n10\\n101\\n11111\\n0\\n3\\n1 2\\n6 5\\n4 4\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n2\\n0\\n']\nNote: On the first operation, a new string \"0110\" is created. For *k*\u2009=\u20091 the two possible binary strings of length *k* are \"0\" and \"1\", they are substrings of the new string. For *k*\u2009=\u20092 and greater there exist strings of length *k* that do not appear in this string (for *k*\u2009=\u20092 such string is \"00\"). So the answer is 1.\n\nOn the second operation the string \"01100\" is created. Now all strings of length *k*\u2009=\u20092 are present.\n\nOn the third operation the string \"1111111111\" is created. There is no zero, so the answer is 0."}]}}

In the output section below you will see the information about flushing the output.\n\nBear Limak thinks of some hidden number\u00a0\u2014 an integer from interval [2,<=100]. Your task is to say if the hidden number is prime or composite.\n\nInteger *x*<=&gt;<=1 is called prime if it has exactly two distinct divisors, 1 and *x*. If integer *x*<=&gt;<=1 is not prime, it's called composite.\n\nYou can ask up to 20 queries about divisors of the hidden number. In each query you should print an integer from interval [2,<=100]. The system will answer \"yes\" if your integer is a divisor of the hidden number. Otherwise, the answer will be \"no\".\n\nFor example, if the hidden number is 14 then the system will answer \"yes\" only if you print 2, 7 or 14.\n\nWhen you are done asking queries, print \"prime\" or \"composite\" and terminate your program.\n\nYou will get the Wrong Answer verdict if you ask more than 20 queries, or if you print an integer not from the range [2,<=100]. Also, you will get the Wrong Answer verdict if the printed answer isn't correct.\n\nYou will get the Idleness Limit Exceeded verdict if you don't print anything (but you should) or if you forget about flushing the output (more info below).\nInput specification: After each query you should read one string from the input. It will be \"yes\" if the printed integer is a divisor of the hidden number, and \"no\" otherwise.. Output specification: Up to 20 times you can ask a query\u00a0\u2014 print an integer from interval [2,<=100] in one line. You have to both print the end-of-line character and flush the output. After flushing you should read a response from the input.\n\nIn any moment you can print the answer \"prime\" or \"composite\" (without the quotes). After that, flush the output and terminate your program.\n\nTo flush you can use (just after printing an integer and end-of-line): \n -  fflush(stdout) in C++; -  System.out.flush() in Java; -  stdout.flush() in Python; -  flush(output) in Pascal; -  See the documentation for other languages. \nHacking.

In the interval [2,\u2009100] there is only one number with this divisor. The hidden number must be 59, which is prime.

For example, 8,<=<=-<=180,<=808 are all lucky while 42,<=<=-<=10 are not. In the Giga Tower, if you write code at a floor with lucky floor number, good luck will always be with you (Well, this round is #278, also lucky, huh?).\n\nTourist Henry goes to the tower to seek good luck. Now he is at the floor numbered *a*. He wants to find the minimum positive integer *b*, such that, if he walks *b* floors higher, he will arrive at a floor with a lucky number.\nInput specification: The only line of input contains an integer *a* (<=-<=109<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=109).. Output specification: Print the minimum *b* in a line.\nDemo input: ['179\\n', '-1\\n', '18\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '9\\n', '10\\n']\nNote: For the first sample, he has to arrive at the floor numbered 180.\n\nFor the second sample, he will arrive at 8.\n\nNote that *b* should be positive, so the answer for the third sample is 10, not 0."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Although Inzane successfully found his beloved bone, Zane, his owner, has yet to return. To search for Zane, he would need a lot of money, of which he sadly has none. To deal with the problem, he has decided to hack the banks.\n\nThere are *n* banks, numbered from 1 to *n*. There are also *n*<=-<=1 wires connecting the banks. All banks are initially online. Each bank also has its initial strength: bank *i* has initial strength *a**i*.\n\nLet us define some keywords before we proceed. Bank *i* and bank *j* are neighboring if and only if there exists a wire directly connecting them. Bank *i* and bank *j* are semi-neighboring if and only if there exists an online bank *k* such that bank *i* and bank *k* are neighboring and bank *k* and bank *j* are neighboring.\n\nWhen a bank is hacked, it becomes offline (and no longer online), and other banks that are neighboring or semi-neighboring to it have their strengths increased by 1.\n\nTo start his plan, Inzane will choose a bank to hack first. Indeed, the strength of such bank must not exceed the strength of his computer. After this, he will repeatedly choose some bank to hack next until all the banks are hacked, but he can continue to hack bank *x* if and only if all these conditions are met:\n 1.  Bank *x* is online. That is, bank *x* is not hacked yet. 1.  Bank *x* is neighboring to some offline bank. 1.

Otherwise, the friends won't write the problem's solution.\n\nThis contest offers *n* problems to the participants. For each problem we know, which friend is sure about the solution.

Then *n* lines contain three integers each, each integer is either 0 or 1. If the first number in the line equals 1, then Petya is sure about the problem's solution, otherwise he isn't sure.

Write a python script for the following problem: After the contest in comparing numbers, Shapur's teacher found out that he is a real genius and that no one could possibly do the calculations faster than him even using a super computer!\n\nSome days before the contest, the teacher took a very simple-looking exam and all his *n* students took part in the exam. The teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation.\n\nUnfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.\n\nNow the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers.\n\nShapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: \n -  As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. -  As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include \"-\", \";\" and \"_\". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. -  The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600 -  My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. -  Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN -  You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong. Do this by writing \"WA\" for Wrong answer or \"ACC\" for a correct answer. -  I should remind you that none of the strings (initial strings or answers) are empty. -  Finally, do these as soon as possible. You have less than 2 hours to complete this.\nInput specification: The first three lines contain a string each. These are the initial strings. They consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). All the initial strings have length from 1 to 100, inclusively.\n\nIn the fourth line there is a single integer *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000), the number of students.\n\nNext *n* lines contain a student's answer each. It is guaranteed that the answer meets what the teacher said. Each answer iconsists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). Length is from 1 to 600, inclusively.. Output specification: For each student write in a different line. Print \"WA\" if his answer is wrong or \"ACC\" if his answer is OK.\nDemo input: ['Iran_\\nPersian;\\nW_o;n;d;e;r;f;u;l;\\n7\\nWonderfulPersianIran\\nwonderful_PersIAN_IRAN;;_\\nWONDERFUL___IRAN__PERSIAN__;;\\nIra__Persiann__Wonderful\\nWonder;;fulPersian___;I;r;a;n;\\n__________IranPersianWonderful__________\\nPersianIran_is_Wonderful\\n', 'Shapur;;\\nis___\\na_genius\\n3\\nShapur__a_is___geniUs\\nis___shapur___a__Genius;\\nShapur;;is;;a;;geni;;us;;\\n'], Demo output: ['ACC\\nACC\\nACC\\nWA\\nACC\\nACC\\nWA\\n', 'WA\\nACC\\nACC\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Moving from the point *x*<==<=0 to *x*<==<=*a* or from the point *x*<==<=*a* to *x*<==<=0 is called a bus journey. In total, the bus must make *k* journeys.\n\nThe petrol tank of the bus can hold *b* liters of gasoline. To pass a single unit of distance the bus needs to spend exactly one liter of gasoline. The bus starts its first journey with a full petrol tank.\n\nThere is a gas station in point *x*<==<=*f*. This point is between points *x*<==<=0 and *x*<==<=*a*. There are no other gas stations on the bus route. While passing by a gas station in either direction the bus can stop and completely refuel its tank.

The first journey starts in the point *x*<==<=0.\nInput specification: The first line contains four integers *a*, *b*, *f*, *k* (0<=&lt;<=*f*<=&lt;<=*a*<=\u2264<=106, 1<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=109, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the endpoint of the first bus journey, the capacity of the fuel tank of the bus, the point where the gas station is located, and the required number of journeys..

So the bus makes the whole first journey, passes 4 units of the distance of the second journey and arrives at the point with the gas station. Then it can refuel its tank, finish the second journey and pass 2 units of distance from the third journey. In this case, it will again arrive at the point with the gas station. Further, he can refill the tank up to 10 liters to finish the third journey and ride all the way of the fourth journey. At the end of the journey the tank will be empty. \n\nIn the third example the bus can not make all 3 journeys because if it refuels during the second journey, the tanks will contain only 5 liters of gasoline, but the bus needs to pass 8 units of distance until next refueling."}]}}

Help him find out if the given number *n* is almost lucky.\nInput specification: The single line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the number that needs to be checked.. Output specification: In the only line print \"YES\" (without the quotes), if number *n* is almost lucky. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\nDemo input: ['47\\n', '16\\n', '78\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: Note that all lucky numbers are almost lucky as any number is evenly divisible by itself.\n\nIn the first sample 47 is a lucky number. In the second sample 16 is divisible by 4."}]}}

Moving from the point *x*<==<=0 to *x*<==<=*a* or from the point *x*<==<=*a* to *x*<==<=0 is called a bus journey. In total, the bus must make *k* journeys.\n\nThe petrol tank of the bus can hold *b* liters of gasoline. To pass a single unit of distance the bus needs to spend exactly one liter of gasoline. The bus starts its first journey with a full petrol tank.\n\nThere is a gas station in point *x*<==<=*f*. This point is between points *x*<==<=0 and *x*<==<=*a*. There are no other gas stations on the bus route. While passing by a gas station in either direction the bus can stop and completely refuel its tank. Thus, after stopping to refuel the tank will contain *b* liters of gasoline.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of times the bus needs to refuel at the point *x*<==<=*f* to make *k* journeys?

Then it can refuel its tank, finish the second journey and pass 2 units of distance from the third journey. In this case, it will again arrive at the point with the gas station. Further, he can refill the tank up to 10 liters to finish the third journey and ride all the way of the fourth journey. At the end of the journey the tank will be empty. \n\nIn the third example the bus can not make all 3 journeys because if it refuels during the second journey, the tanks will contain only 5 liters of gasoline, but the bus needs to pass 8 units of distance until next refueling."}]}}

The sensor is placed on the rim of the wheel, that is, on some fixed point on a circle of radius *r*. After that the counter moves just like the chosen point of the circle, i.e. moves forward and rotates around the center of the circle.\n\nAt the beginning each participant can choose any point *b**i*, such that his bike is fully behind the starting line, that is, *b**i*<=&lt;<=*s**i*<=-<=*r*. After that, he starts the movement, instantly accelerates to his maximum speed and at time *ts**i*, when the coordinate of the sensor is equal to the coordinate of the start, the time counter starts. The cyclist makes a complete ride, moving with his maximum speed and at the moment the sensor's coordinate is equal to the coordinate of the finish (moment of time *tf**i*), the time counter deactivates and records the final time. Thus, the counter records that the participant made a complete ride in time *tf**i*<=-<=*ts**i*.\n\nMaxim is good at math and he suspects that the total result doesn't only depend on his maximum speed *v*, but also on his choice of the initial point *b**i*.

In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.\nInput specification: There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number. It is guaranteed that the numbers are made from 0 and 1 only and that their length is same. The numbers may start with 0. The length of each number doesn't exceed 100.. Output specification: Write one line \u2014 the corresponding answer. Do not omit the leading 0s.\nDemo input: ['1010100\\n0100101\\n', '000\\n111\\n', '1110\\n1010\\n', '01110\\n01100\\n'], Demo output: ['1110001\\n', '111\\n', '0100\\n', '00010\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Then Maria gathers in a single group all the students who have been just reprimanded. She kicks them out from the club. This group of students immediately leaves the club. These students takes with them the laces that used to tie them. Then again for every student Anna finds out how many other students he is tied to and so on.

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the elements of array. \n\nThe third line contains integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs. Separate the numbers by spaces.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nDemo input: ['2\\n1 2\\n1\\n1\\n', '2\\n2 1\\n1\\n1\\n', '3\\n3 1 2\\n3\\n1 2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['1 2\\n', '2 1\\n', '6 6\\n']\nNote: In the first sample Vasya's approach will make one comparison (it starts with the 1-st element and immediately finds the required number), and Petya's approach makes two comparisons (first he compares with the 2-nd array element, doesn't find the search item and compares with the 1-st element).\n\nIn the second sample, on the contrary, Vasya's approach will need two comparisons (first with 1-st element, and then with the 2-nd), and Petya's approach will find the required value in one comparison (the first comparison with the 2-nd element)."}]}}

Like all the sharks, she has several rows of teeth, and feeds on crucians. One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are \"relaxing\".\n\nFor a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap).\n\nIt turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again. \n\nUnhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her. For sure, the shark couldn't say no to her favourite meal, but she had no desire to go back to the dentist. That's why she decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that the viability of no tooth becomes negative. \n\nAs Valerie is not good at mathematics, she asked you to help her to find out the total amount of crucians that she can consume for dinner.\n\nWe should remind you that while eating one crucian Valerie uses exactly one row of teeth and the viability of each tooth from this row decreases by one.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000,<=0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 total amount of Valerie's teeth, amount of tooth rows and amount of crucians in Valerie's portion for dinner.

Write a python script for the following problem: Alas, finding one's true love is not easy. Masha has been unsuccessful in that yet. Her friend Dasha told Masha about a way to determine the phone number of one's Prince Charming through arithmancy. \n\nThe phone number is divined like that. First one needs to write down one's own phone numbers. For example, let's suppose that Masha's phone number is 12345. After that one should write her favorite digit from 0 to 9 under the first digit of her number. That will be the first digit of the needed number. For example, Masha's favorite digit is 9. The second digit is determined as a half sum of the second digit of Masha's number and the already written down first digit from her beloved one's number. In this case the arithmetic average equals to (2<=+<=9)<=/<=2<==<=5.5. Masha can round the number up or down, depending on her wishes. For example, she chooses the digit 5. Having written down the resulting digit under the second digit of her number, Masha moves to finding the third digit in the same way, i.e. finding the half sum the the third digit of her number and the second digit of the new number. The result is (5<=+<=3)<=/<=2<==<=4. In this case the answer is unique. Thus, every *i*-th digit is determined as an arithmetic average of the *i*-th digit of Masha's number and the *i*<=-<=1-th digit of her true love's number. If needed, the digit can be rounded up or down. For example, Masha can get:\nInput specification: The first line contains nonempty sequence consisting of digits from 0 to 9 \u2014 Masha's phone number. The sequence length does not exceed 50..

For example, the Hamming distance between words \"permanent\" and \"pergament\" is two, as these words differ in the fourth and sixth letters.\n\nMoreover, as he was searching for information, he also noticed that modern search engines have powerful mechanisms to correct errors in the request to improve the quality of search. Ford doesn't know much about human beings, so he assumed that the most common mistake in a request is swapping two arbitrary letters of the string (not necessarily adjacent).

It is guaranteed that at least one of those numbers is larger than zero.. Output specification: Print a single number \u2014 the number of the day of the week, when Petr will finish reading the book.

Next *n* lines contain the times of the queries in the format \"hh:mm:ss\", where hh are hours, mm are minutes, ss are seconds. The times of the queries follow in the non-decreasing order, some of them can coincide. It is guaranteed that all the times and even all the segments of type [*s*,<=*s*<=+<=*T*<=-<=1] are within one 24-hour range (from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59).. Output specification: In the first line print number *R* \u2014 the largest possible number of distinct users. The following *n* lines should contain the user IDs for requests in the same order in which the requests are given in the input. User IDs must be integers from 1 to *R*. The requests of the same user must correspond to the same identifiers, the requests of distinct users must correspond to distinct identifiers. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. If there is no solution, print \"No solution\" (without the quotes).\nDemo input: ['4 2 10\\n17:05:53\\n17:05:58\\n17:06:01\\n22:39:47\\n', '1 2 86400\\n00:00:00\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n1\\n2\\n2\\n3\\n', 'No solution\\n']\nNote: Consider the first sample. The user who sent the first request was online from 17:05:53 to 17:06:02, the user who sent the second request was online from 17:05:58 to 17:06:07, the user who sent the third request, was online from 17:06:01 to 17:06:10. Thus, these IDs cannot belong to three distinct users, because in that case all these users would be online, for example, at 17:06:01. That is impossible, because *M*\u2009=\u20092. That means that some two of these queries belonged to the same user. One of the correct variants is given in the answer to the sample. For it user 1 was online from 17:05:53 to 17:06:02, user 2 \u2014 from 17:05:58 to 17:06:10 (he sent the second and third queries), user 3 \u2014 from 22:39:47 to 22:39:56.\n\nIn the second sample there is only one query. So, only one user visited the network within the 24-hour period and there couldn't be two users online on the network simultaneously. (The time the user spent online is the union of time intervals for requests, so users who didn't send requests could not be online in the network.)"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Merge sort is a well-known sorting algorithm. The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:\n 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=\u2264<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* \u2014 *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\nInput specification: The first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it.. Output specification: If a permutation of size *n* such that there will be exactly *k* calls of *mergesort* while sorting it doesn't exist, output <=-<=1. Otherwise output *n* integer numbers *a*[0],<=*a*[1],<=...,<=*a*[*n*<=-<=1] \u2014 the elements of a permutation that would meet the required conditions. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['3 3\\n', '4 1\\n', '5 6\\n'], Demo output: ['2 1 3 ', '1 2 3 4 ', '-1\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Limak can perform them in any order, any operation may be applied any number of times. The *i*-th operation is described by a string *a**i* of length two and a string *b**i* of length one. No two of *q* possible operations have the same string *a**i*.\n\nWhen Limak has a string *s* he can perform the *i*-th operation on *s* if the first two letters of *s* match a two-letter string *a**i*. Performing the *i*-th operation removes first two letters of *s* and inserts there a string *b**i*. See the notes section for further clarification.\n\nYou may note that performing an operation decreases the length of a string *s* exactly by 1. Also, for some sets of operations there may be a string that cannot be compressed any further, because the first two letters don't match any *a**i*.\n\nLimak wants to start with a string of length *n* and perform *n*<=-<=1 operations to finally get a one-letter string \"a\". In how many ways can he choose the starting string to be able to get \"a\"?

There are 4 such strings: \"abb\", \"cab\", \"cca\", \"eea\". The first one Limak can compress using operation 1 two times (changing \"ab\" to a single \"a\").

Write a python script for the following problem: In this problem you will write a simple code generator for a 2D programming language derived from [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).\n\nThe code in this language is a rectangular grid of characters '.' and 'X'. The code is converted to a Brainfuck program as follows: the characters are read in the usual order (top to bottom, left to right), and each 'X' character is converted a Brainfuck instruction to be executed. The instruction is defined by the left, top and right neighbors of the 'X' character using the following conversion table:\n\nYou are given a string. Output a program in the described language which prints this string.\n\nYou can download the language interpreter used for judging here: [https://assets.codeforces.com/rounds/952/puzzling-interpreter.cpp](https://assets.codeforces.com/rounds/952/puzzling-interpreter.cpp) (use C++11 to compile the code). Note several implementation details:\n-  The first step of the language interpretation is conversion to a Brainfuck program, which is then executed.-  The code must be rectangular, with all lines of the same length. It can have at most 10,000 lines and 10,000 columns, and can have at most 500,000 'X' characters.-  The code has toroidal topology, i.e. the 'X' on the first line will have top neighbor in the last line.-  Brainfuck interpreter has 30000 memory cells which store integers from 0 to 255 with increment/decrement done modulo 256.-  Console input (, command) is allowed in Brainfuck code but has no effect when executed.\nInput specification: The input consists of a single string of characters with ASCII codes between 33 ('!') and 122 ('z'), inclusive.

The next line after the triangular block moves the memory pointer to the second memory cell, and the next three lines print the '$' character three times."}]}}

Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any *f* days from *n* next for sell-outs. On each of *f* chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on *i*-th day shop planned to put up for sale *k**i* products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7*k**i* products.

It is possible that Vasya puts multiple balls to the same box, and it is also possible that one or more balls will go to the box number *i*. If *i*<==<=*n*, Vasya puts the first ball into the box number 1, then the next ball goes to box 2 and so on. \n\nFor example, let's suppose that initially Vasya had four boxes, and the first box had 3 balls, the second one had 2, the third one had 5 and the fourth one had 4 balls. Then, if *i*<==<=3, then Vasya will take all five balls out of the third box and put them in the boxes with numbers: 4,<=1,<=2,<=3,<=4. After all Vasya's actions the balls will lie in the boxes as follows: in the first box there are 4 balls, 3 in the second one, 1 in the third one and 6 in the fourth one.\n\nAt this point Vasya has completely forgotten the original arrangement of the balls in the boxes, but he knows how they are arranged now, and the number *x* \u2014 the number of the box, where he put the last of the taken out balls.\n\nHe asks you to help to find the initial arrangement of the balls in the boxes.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *x* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*), that represent the number of the boxes and the index of the box that got the last ball from Vasya, correspondingly.

Sometimes they receive parcels from Uncle Fyodor\u2019s parents and sometimes from anonymous benefactors, in which case it is hard to determine to which one of them the package has been sent. A photographic rifle is obviously for Sharic who loves hunting and fish is for Matroskin, but for whom was a new video game console meant? Every one of the three friends claimed that the present is for him and nearly quarreled. Uncle Fyodor had an idea how to solve the problem justly: they should suppose that the console was sent to all three of them and play it in turns. Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up \u2014 who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that\u2019s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player wins. Otherwise, another game round is required. Write a program that will determine the winner by the gestures they have shown.\nInput specification: The first input line contains the name of the gesture that Uncle Fyodor showed, the second line shows which gesture Matroskin showed and the third line shows Sharic\u2019s gesture..

Write a python script for the following problem: Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Far Far Away lived Sam the Farmer. Sam had a cow named Dawn and he was deeply attached to her. Sam would spend the whole summer stocking hay to feed Dawn in winter. Sam scythed hay and put it into haystack. As Sam was a bright farmer, he tried to make the process of storing hay simpler and more convenient to use. He collected the hay into cubical hay blocks of the same size. Then he stored the blocks in his barn. After a summer spent in hard toil Sam stored *A*\u00b7*B*\u00b7*C* hay blocks and stored them in a barn as a rectangular parallelepiped *A* layers high. Each layer had *B* rows and each row had *C* blocks.\n\nAt the end of the autumn Sam came into the barn to admire one more time the hay he'd been stacking during this hard summer. Unfortunately, Sam was horrified to see that the hay blocks had been carelessly scattered around the barn. The place was a complete mess. As it turned out, thieves had sneaked into the barn. They completely dissembled and took away a layer of blocks from the parallelepiped's front, back, top and sides. As a result, the barn only had a parallelepiped containing (*A*<=-<=1)<=\u00d7<=(*B*<=-<=2)<=\u00d7<=(*C*<=-<=2) hay blocks. To hide the evidence of the crime, the thieves had dissembled the parallelepiped into single 1<=\u00d7<=1<=\u00d7<=1 blocks and scattered them around the barn. After the theft Sam counted *n* hay blocks in the barn but he forgot numbers *A*, *B* \u0438 *C*.\n\nGiven number *n*, find the minimally possible and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks.\nInput specification: The only line contains integer *n* from the problem's statement (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=109).. Output specification: Print space-separated minimum and maximum number of hay blocks that could have been stolen by the thieves.\n\nNote that the answer to the problem can be large enough, so you must use the 64-bit integer type for calculations. Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.\nDemo input: ['4\\n', '7\\n', '12\\n'], Demo output: ['28 41\\n', '47 65\\n', '48 105\\n']\nNote: Let's consider the first sample test. If initially Sam has a parallelepiped consisting of 32\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009\u00d7\u20094 hay blocks in his barn, then after the theft the barn has 4\u2009=\u2009(2\u2009-\u20091)\u2009\u00d7\u2009(4\u2009-\u20092)\u2009\u00d7\u2009(4\u2009-\u20092) hay blocks left. Thus, the thieves could have stolen 32\u2009-\u20094\u2009=\u200928 hay blocks. If Sam initially had a parallelepiped consisting of 45\u2009=\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093 hay blocks in his barn, then after the theft the barn has 4\u2009=\u2009(5\u2009-\u20091)\u2009\u00d7\u2009(3\u2009-\u20092)\u2009\u00d7\u2009(3\u2009-\u20092) hay blocks left. Thus, the thieves could have stolen 45\u2009-\u20094\u2009=\u200941 hay blocks. No other variants of the blocks' initial arrangement (that leave Sam with exactly 4 blocks after the theft) can permit the thieves to steal less than 28 or more than 41 blocks."}]}}

For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation.\n\nUnfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.\n\nNow the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers.\n\nShapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: \n -  As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. -  As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include \"-\", \";\" and \"_\". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. -  The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600 -  My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. -  Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN -  You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong. Do this by writing \"WA\" for Wrong answer or \"ACC\" for a correct answer. -  I should remind you that none of the strings (initial strings or answers) are empty. -  Finally, do these as soon as possible. You have less than 2 hours to complete this.\nInput specification: The first three lines contain a string each. These are the initial strings. They consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). All the initial strings have length from 1 to 100, inclusively.\n\nIn the fourth line there is a single integer *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000), the number of students.\n\nNext *n* lines contain a student's answer each. It is guaranteed that the answer meets what the teacher said. Each answer iconsists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). Length is from 1 to 600, inclusively.. Output specification: For each student write in a different line. Print \"WA\" if his answer is wrong or \"ACC\" if his answer is OK.\nDemo input: ['Iran_\\nPersian;\\nW_o;n;d;e;r;f;u;l;\\n7\\nWonderfulPersianIran\\nwonderful_PersIAN_IRAN;;_\\nWONDERFUL___IRAN__PERSIAN__;;\\nIra__Persiann__Wonderful\\nWonder;;fulPersian___;I;r;a;n;\\n__________IranPersianWonderful__________\\nPersianIran_is_Wonderful\\n', 'Shapur;;\\nis___\\na_genius\\n3\\nShapur__a_is___geniUs\\nis___shapur___a__Genius;\\nShapur;;is;;a;;geni;;us;;\\n'], Demo output: ['ACC\\nACC\\nACC\\nWA\\nACC\\nACC\\nWA\\n', 'WA\\nACC\\nACC\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: The mobile application store has a new game called \"Subway Roller\".\n\nThe protagonist of the game Philip is located in one end of the tunnel and wants to get out of the other one. The tunnel is a rectangular field consisting of three rows and *n* columns. At the beginning of the game the hero is in some cell of the leftmost column. Some number of trains rides towards the hero. Each train consists of two or more neighbouring cells in some row of the field.\n\nAll trains are moving from right to left at a speed of two cells per second, and the hero runs from left to right at the speed of one cell per second. For simplicity, the game is implemented so that the hero and the trains move in turns. First, the hero moves one cell to the right, then one square up or down, or stays idle. Then all the trains move twice simultaneously one cell to the left. Thus, in one move, Philip definitely makes a move to the right and can move up or down. If at any point, Philip is in the same cell with a train, he loses. If the train reaches the left column, it continues to move as before, leaving the tunnel.\n\nYour task is to answer the question whether there is a sequence of movements of Philip, such that he would be able to get to the rightmost column.\nInput specification: Each test contains from one to ten sets of the input data. The first line of the test contains a single integer *t* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=10 for pretests and tests or *t*<==<=1 for hacks; see the Notes section for details) \u2014 the number of sets.\n\nThen follows the description of *t* sets of the input data. \n\nThe first line of the description of each set contains two integers *n*,<=*k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100,<=1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=26) \u2014 the number of columns on the field and the number of trains. Each of the following three lines contains the sequence of *n* character, representing the row of the field where the game is on. Philip's initial position is marked as 's', he is in the leftmost column. Each of the *k* trains is marked by some sequence of identical uppercase letters of the English alphabet, located in one line. Distinct trains are represented by distinct letters. Character '.' represents an empty cell, that is, the cell that doesn't contain either Philip or the trains.. Output specification: For each set of the input data print on a single line word YES, if it is possible to win the game and word NO otherwise.\nDemo input: ['2\\n16 4\\n...AAAAA........\\ns.BBB......CCCCC\\n........DDDDD...\\n16 4\\n...AAAAA........\\ns.BBB....CCCCC..\\n.......DDDDD....\\n', '2\\n10 4\\ns.ZZ......\\n.....AAABB\\n.YYYYYY...\\n10 4\\ns.ZZ......\\n....AAAABB\\n.YYYYYY...\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\nNO\\n', 'YES\\nNO\\n']\nNote: In the first set of the input of the first sample Philip must first go forward and go down to the third row of the field, then go only forward, then go forward and climb to the second row, go forward again and go up to the first row. After that way no train blocks Philip's path, so he can go straight to the end of the tunnel.\n\nNote that in this problem the challenges are restricted to tests that contain only one testset."}]}}

Substrings are different if and only if their contents aren't equal, their positions of occurence don't matter. Petya wasn't quite good at math, that's why he couldn't count this number. Help him!\nInput specification: The input file consists of three lines. The first line contains string *t*. The second and the third lines contain the *s**begin* and *s**end* identificators, correspondingly. All three lines are non-empty strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of each string doesn't exceed 2000 characters.. Output specification: Output the only number \u2014 the amount of different substrings of *t* that start with *s**begin* and end with *s**end*.\nDemo input: ['round\\nro\\nou\\n', 'codeforces\\ncode\\nforca\\n', 'abababab\\na\\nb\\n', 'aba\\nab\\nba\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '0\\n', '4\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: In the third sample there are four appropriate different substrings. They are: ab, abab, ababab, abababab.\n\nIn the fourth sample identificators intersect."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Kostya is a progamer specializing in the discipline of Dota 2. Valve Corporation, the developer of this game, has recently released a new patch which turned the balance of the game upside down. Kostya, as the captain of the team, realizes that the greatest responsibility lies on him, so he wants to resort to the analysis of innovations patch from the mathematical point of view to choose the best heroes for his team in every game.\n\nA Dota 2 match involves two teams, each of them must choose some heroes that the players of the team are going to play for, and it is forbidden to choose the same hero several times, even in different teams. In large electronic sports competitions where Kostya's team is going to participate, the matches are held in the Captains Mode. In this mode the captains select the heroes by making one of two possible actions in a certain, predetermined order: pick or ban.\n -  To pick a hero for the team. After the captain picks, the picked hero goes to his team (later one of a team members will play it) and can no longer be selected by any of the teams. -  To ban a hero. After the ban the hero is not sent to any of the teams, but it still can no longer be selected by any of the teams. \nThe team captain may miss a pick or a ban. If he misses a pick, a random hero is added to his team from those that were available at that moment, and if he misses a ban, no hero is banned, as if there was no ban.\n\nKostya has already identified the strength of all the heroes based on the new patch fixes. Of course, Kostya knows the order of picks and bans. The strength of a team is the sum of the strengths of the team's heroes and both teams that participate in the match seek to maximize the difference in strengths in their favor. Help Kostya determine what team, the first one or the second one, has advantage in the match, and how large the advantage is.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of heroes in Dota 2.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *s*1, *s*2, ..., *s**n* (1<=\u2264<=*s**i*<=\u2264<=106)\u00a0\u2014 the strengths of all the heroes.\n\nThe third line contains a single integer *m* (2<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*min*(*n*,<=20))\u00a0\u2014 the number of actions the captains of the team must perform.\n\nNext *m* lines look like \"*action*\u00a0*team*\", where *action* is the needed action: a pick (represented as a \"p\") or a ban (represented as a \"b\"), and *team* is the number of the team that needs to perform the action (number 1 or 2).\n\nIt is guaranteed that each team makes at least one pick. Besides, each team has the same number of picks and the same number of bans..

He was in such a hurry to launch it for the first time that he plugged in the power wires without giving it a proper glance and started experimenting right away. After a while Mike observed that the wires ended up entangled and now have to be untangled again.\n\nThe device is powered by two wires \"plus\" and \"minus\". The wires run along the floor from the wall (on the left) to the device (on the right). Both the wall and the device have two contacts in them on the same level, into which the wires are plugged in some order. The wires are considered entangled if there are one or more places where one wire runs above the other one. For example, the picture below has four such places (top view):\n\nMike knows the sequence in which the wires run above each other. Mike also noticed that on the left side, the \"plus\" wire is always plugged into the top contact (as seen on the picture). He would like to untangle the wires without unplugging them and without moving the device. Determine if it is possible to do that.

Thus the wires cannot be untangled: \n\nIn the third testcase the \"plus\" wire simply runs above the \"minus\" wire twice in sequence.

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time.

Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$."}]}}

Scientists from all over the Berland study how the temperatures and weather change, and they claim that this summer is abnormally hot. But any scientific claim sounds a lot more reasonable if there are some numbers involved, so they have decided to actually calculate some value which would represent how high the temperatures are.\n\nMathematicians of Berland State University came up with a special heat intensity value. This value is calculated as follows:\n\nSuppose we want to analyze the segment of $n$ consecutive days. We have measured the temperatures during these $n$ days; the temperature during $i$-th day equals $a_i$.\n\nWe denote the average temperature of a segment of some consecutive days as the arithmetic mean of the temperature measures during this segment of days. So, if we want to analyze the average temperature from day $x$ to day $y$, we calculate it as $\\frac{\\sum \\limits_{i = x}^{y} a_i}{y - x + 1}$ (note that division is performed without any rounding). The heat intensity value is the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than $k$ consecutive days. For example, if analyzing the measures $[3, 4, 1, 2]$ and $k = 3$, we are interested in segments $[3, 4, 1]$, $[4, 1, 2]$ and $[3, 4, 1, 2]$ (we want to find the maximum value of average temperature over these segments).\n\nYou have been hired by Berland State University to write a program that would compute the heat intensity value of a given period of days.

And she has found one!\n\nWhy not make her own Codeforces, with blackjack and other really cool stuff? Many people will surely be willing to visit this splendid shrine of high culture.\n\nIn Mainframe a standard pack of 52 cards is used to play blackjack. The pack contains cards of 13 values: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jacks, queens, kings and aces. Each value also exists in one of four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. Also, each card earns some value in points assigned to it: cards with value from two to ten earn from 2 to 10 points, correspondingly. An ace can either earn 1 or 11, whatever the player wishes. The picture cards (king, queen and jack) earn 10 points. The number of points a card earns does not depend on the suit. The rules of the game are very simple. The player gets two cards, if the sum of points of those cards equals *n*, then the player wins, otherwise the player loses.\n\nThe player has already got the first card, it's the queen of spades. To evaluate chances for victory, you should determine how many ways there are to get the second card so that the sum of points exactly equals *n*.\nInput specification: The only line contains *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=25) \u2014 the required sum of points.. Output specification: Print the numbers of ways to get the second card in the required way if the first card is the queen of spades.\nDemo input: ['12\\n', '20\\n', '10\\n'], Demo output: ['4', '15', '0']\nNote: In the first sample only four two's of different suits can earn the required sum of points.\n\nIn the second sample we can use all tens, jacks, queens and kings; overall it's 15 cards, as the queen of spades (as any other card) is only present once in the pack of cards and it's already in use.\n\nIn the third sample there is no card, that would add a zero to the current ten points."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: It is winter now, and Max decided it's about time he watered the garden.\n\nThe garden can be represented as *n* consecutive garden beds, numbered from 1 to *n*. *k* beds contain water taps (*i*-th tap is located in the bed *x**i*), which, if turned on, start delivering water to neighbouring beds. If the tap on the bed *x**i* is turned on, then after one second has passed, the bed *x**i* will be watered; after two seconds have passed, the beds from the segment [*x**i*<=-<=1,<=*x**i*<=+<=1] will be watered (if they exist); after *j* seconds have passed (*j* is an integer number), the beds from the segment [*x**i*<=-<=(*j*<=-<=1),<=*x**i*<=+<=(*j*<=-<=1)] will be watered (if they exist). Nothing changes during the seconds, so, for example, we can't say that the segment [*x**i*<=-<=2.5,<=*x**i*<=+<=2.5] will be watered after 2.5 seconds have passed; only the segment [*x**i*<=-<=2,<=*x**i*<=+<=2] will be watered at that moment.\n\nMax wants to turn on all the water taps at the same moment, and now he wonders, what is the minimum number of seconds that have to pass after he turns on some taps until the whole garden is watered.

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$.. Output specification: Print the only integer \u2014 maximum possible total time when the lamp is lit.\nDemo input: ['3 10\\n4 6 7\\n', '2 12\\n1 10\\n', '2 7\\n3 4\\n'], Demo output: ['8\\n', '9\\n', '6\\n']\nNote: In the first example, one of possible optimal solutions is to insert value $x = 3$ before $a_1$, so program will be $[3, 4, 6, 7]$ and time of lamp being lit equals $(3 - 0) + (6 - 4) + (10 - 7) = 8$. Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$."}]}}

Formally: we number all the planets from $1$ to $n$. $1$ is Earth, $n$ is Mars. Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt.

Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons.-  During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining.-  While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. There will be $14$ tons of rocket with fuel after that.-  During landing on Earth, one ton of fuel can land $7$ tons of cargo, so for landing $14$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel.

Write a python script for the following problem: Further research on zombie thought processes yielded interesting results. As we know from the previous problem, the nervous system of a zombie consists of *n* brains and *m* brain connectors joining some pairs of brains together. It was observed that the intellectual abilities of a zombie depend mainly on the topology of its nervous system. More precisely, we define the distance between two brains *u* and *v* (1<=\u2264<=*u*,<=*v*<=\u2264<=*n*) as the minimum number of brain connectors used when transmitting a thought between these two brains. The brain latency of a zombie is defined to be the maximum distance between any two of its brains. Researchers conjecture that the brain latency is the crucial parameter which determines how smart a given zombie is. Help them test this conjecture by writing a program to compute brain latencies of nervous systems.\n\nIn this problem you may assume that any nervous system given in the input is valid, i.e., it satisfies conditions (1) and (2) from the easy version.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100000) denoting the number of brains (which are conveniently numbered from 1 to *n*) and the number of brain connectors in the nervous system, respectively.

Menshykov, Uslada and Horace decided to make either an elephant or a bear from those sticks. They can make an animal from sticks in the following way: \n -  Four sticks represent the animal's legs, these sticks should have the same length. -  Two remaining sticks represent the animal's head and body. The bear's head stick must be shorter than the body stick. The elephant, however, has a long trunk, so his head stick must be as long as the body stick.

Write a python script for the following problem: Kevin Sun has just finished competing in Codeforces Round #334! The round was 120 minutes long and featured five problems with maximum point values of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500, respectively. Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.\n\nCodeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is *x*, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute *m* but made *w* wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is . His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.\n\nAll arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains five space-separated integers *m*1, *m*2, *m*3, *m*4, *m*5, where *m**i* (0<=\u2264<=*m**i*<=\u2264<=119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem *i*. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted.\n\nThe second line contains five space-separated integers *w*1, *w*2, *w*3, *w*4, *w*5, where *w**i* (0<=\u2264<=*w**i*<=\u2264<=10) is Kevin's number of wrong submissions on problem *i*.\n\nThe last line contains two space-separated integers *h**s* and *h**u* (0<=\u2264<=*h**s*,<=*h**u*<=\u2264<=20), denoting the Kevin's numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively.. Output specification: Print a single integer, the value of Kevin's final score.\nDemo input: ['20 40 60 80 100\\n0 1 2 3 4\\n1 0\\n', '119 119 119 119 119\\n0 0 0 0 0\\n10 0\\n'], Demo output: ['4900\\n', '4930\\n']\nNote: In the second sample, Kevin takes 119 minutes on all of the problems. Therefore, he gets <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/42158dc2bc78cd21fa679530ae9ef8b9ea298d15.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> of the points on each problem. So his score from solving problems is <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/fdf392d8508500b57f8057ac0c4c892ab5f925a2.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>. Adding in 10\u00b7100\u2009=\u20091000 points from hacks, his total score becomes 3930\u2009+\u20091000\u2009=\u20094930."}]}}

Output specification: Print $n$ space-separated integers; the lexicographically smallest possible array that represents the image after applying the Posterization filter.\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n2 14 3 4\\n', '5 2\\n0 2 1 255 254\\n'], Demo output: ['0 12 3 3\\n', '0 1 1 254 254\\n']\nNote: One possible way to group colors and assign keys for the first sample:\n\nColor $2$ belongs to the group $[0,2]$, with group key $0$.\n\nColor $14$ belongs to the group $[12,14]$, with group key $12$.\n\nColors $3$ and $4$ belong to group $[3, 5]$, with group key $3$.\n\nOther groups won't affect the result so they are not listed here."}]}}

The grandmother has a large garden, which can be represented as a rectangle 1<=\u00d7<=*n* in size, when viewed from above. This rectangle is divided into *n* equal square sections. The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.\n\nCreating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section. At that, the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section. That is, for example, the garden can be represented by a 1<=\u00d7<=5 rectangle, where the section heights are equal to 4, 2, 3, 3, 2. Then if we create an artificial rain over any of the sections with the height of 3, the water will flow over all the sections, except the ones with the height of 4.

Write a python script for the following problem: Reforms have started in Berland again! At this time, the Parliament is discussing the reform of the calendar. To make the lives of citizens of Berland more varied, it was decided to change the calendar. As more and more people are complaining that \"the years fly by...\", it was decided that starting from the next year the number of days per year will begin to grow. So the coming year will have exactly *a* days, the next after coming year will have *a*<=+<=1 days, the next one will have *a*<=+<=2 days and so on. This schedule is planned for the coming *n* years (in the *n*-th year the length of the year will be equal *a*<=+<=*n*<=-<=1 day).\n\nNo one has yet decided what will become of months. An MP Palevny made the following proposal. \n -  The calendar for each month is comfortable to be printed on a square sheet of paper. We are proposed to make the number of days in each month be the square of some integer. The number of days per month should be the same for each month of any year, but may be different for different years. -  The number of days in each year must be divisible by the number of days per month in this year. This rule ensures that the number of months in each year is an integer. -  The number of days per month for each year must be chosen so as to save the maximum amount of paper to print the calendars. In other words, the number of days per month should be as much as possible. \nThese rules provide an unambiguous method for choosing the number of days in each month for any given year length. For example, according to Palevny's proposition, a year that consists of 108 days will have three months, 36 days each. The year that consists of 99 days will have 11 months, 9 days each, and a year of 365 days will have 365 months, one day each.\n\nThe proposal provoked heated discussion in the community, the famous mathematician Perelmanov quickly calculated that if the proposal is supported, then in a period of *n* years, beginning with the year that has *a* days, the country will spend *p* sheets of paper to print a set of calendars for these years. Perelmanov's calculations take into account the fact that the set will contain one calendar for each year and each month will be printed on a separate sheet.\n\nRepeat Perelmanov's achievement and print the required number *p*. You are given positive integers *a* and *n*. Perelmanov warns you that your program should not work longer than four seconds at the maximum test.\nInput specification: The only input line contains a pair of integers *a*, *n* (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*n*<=\u2264<=107; *a*<=+<=*n*<=-<=1<=\u2264<=107)..

It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nDemo input: ['25 3\\n', '50 5\\n'], Demo output: ['30\\n', '125\\n']\nNote: A note to the first sample test. A year of 25 days will consist of one month containing 25 days. A year of 26 days will consist of 26 months, one day each. A year of 27 days will have three months, 9 days each."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Merge sort is a well-known sorting algorithm. The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:\n 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=\u2264<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* \u2014 *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\nInput specification: The first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it..

Formally: we number all the planets from $1$ to $n$. $1$ is Earth, $n$ is Mars. Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt. Assume, that the rocket takes off and lands instantly.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 number of planets.\n\nThe second line contains the only integer $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 weight of the payload.\n\nThe third line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$), where $a_i$ is the number of tons, which can be lifted off by one ton of fuel.\n\nThe fourth line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le 1000$), where $b_i$ is the number of tons, which can be landed by one ton of fuel. \n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel..

Otherwise, print a single number $-1$.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel.\n\nThe answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $10^{-6}$.

Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons.-  During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining.-  While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. There will be $14$ tons of rocket with fuel after that.-  During landing on Earth, one ton of fuel can land $7$ tons of cargo, so for landing $14$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel.

The mood can be positive, zero or negative.\n\nLet's define a subarray as a segment of consecutive flowers. The mother suggested some set of subarrays. Alyona wants to choose several of the subarrays suggested by her mother.

Suppose the mother suggested subarrays (1,<=<=-<=2), (3,<=<=-<=4), (1,<=3), (1,<=<=-<=2,<=1,<=3).

The king has already sent the message to all knights in the kingdom and they in turn agreed to participate in this grand event.\n\nAs for you, you're just a simple peasant. There's no surprise that you slept in this morning and were late for the tournament (it was a weekend, after all). Now you are really curious about the results of the tournament. This time the tournament in Berland went as follows:\n -  There are *n* knights participating in the tournament. Each knight was assigned his unique number \u2014 an integer from 1 to *n*. -  The tournament consisted of *m* fights, in the *i*-th fight the knights that were still in the game with numbers at least *l**i* and at most *r**i* have fought for the right to continue taking part in the tournament. -  After the *i*-th fight among all participants of the fight only one knight won \u2014 the knight number *x**i*, he continued participating in the tournament. Other knights left the tournament. -  The winner of the last (the *m*-th) fight (the knight number *x**m*) became the winner of the tournament. \nYou fished out all the information about the fights from your friends. Now for each knight you want to know the name of the knight he was conquered by. We think that the knight number *b* was conquered by the knight number *a*, if there was a fight with both of these knights present and the winner was the knight number *a*.\n\nWrite the code that calculates for each knight, the name of the knight that beat him.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n*, *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of knights and the number of fights.
