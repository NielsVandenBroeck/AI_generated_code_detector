Let's number the names from 1 to *n* in the order in which they are written.\n\nAs mom wasn't home, Vasya decided to play with names: he chose three integers *i*, *j*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*j*<=\u2264<=*n*, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*m*), then he took names number *i* and *j* and swapped their prefixes of length *k*. For example, if we take names \"CBDAD\" and \"AABRD\" and swap their prefixes with the length of 3, the result will be names \"AABAD\" and \"CBDRD\".\n\nYou wonder how many different names Vasya can write instead of name number 1, if Vasya is allowed to perform any number of the described actions. As Vasya performs each action, he chooses numbers *i*, *j*, *k* independently from the previous moves and his choice is based entirely on his will. The sought number can be very large, so you should only find it modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of names and the length of each name, correspondingly.

Alternatively, Limak could steal only 3 votes from the third candidate and 1 vote from the second candidate to get situation 9,\u20090,\u20098,\u20092,\u20098.\n\nIn the second sample Limak will steal 2 votes from each candidate.

Besides, the keys are of two types. Some of the keys have lowercase Latin letters on them and some of the keys work like the \"Shift\" key on standard keyboards, that is, they make lowercase letters uppercase.\n\nVasya can press one or two keys with one hand. However, he can only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the keys does not exceed *x*. The keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.\n\nVasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest \"Shift\" key is strictly larger than *x*. In this case he will have to use his other hand. Having typed the symbol, Vasya returns other hand back to the chips.\n\nYou are given Vasya's keyboard and the text.

He has even invented a new variant of chess, which he named \u00abPawnChess\u00bb.\n\nThis new game is played on a board consisting of 8 rows and 8 columns. At the beginning of every game some black and white pawns are placed on the board. The number of black pawns placed is not necessarily equal to the number of white pawns placed. \n\nLets enumerate rows and columns with integers from 1 to 8. Rows are numbered from top to bottom, while columns are numbered from left to right. Now we denote as (*r*,<=*c*) the cell located at the row *r* and at the column *c*.\n\nThere are always two players A and B playing the game. Player A plays with white pawns, while player B plays with black ones. The goal of player A is to put any of his pawns to the row 1, while player B tries to put any of his pawns to the row 8. As soon as any of the players completes his goal the game finishes immediately and the succeeded player is declared a winner.\n\nPlayer A moves first and then they alternate turns. On his move player A must choose exactly one white pawn and move it one step upward and player B (at his turn) must choose exactly one black pawn and move it one step down. Any move is possible only if the targeted cell is empty. It's guaranteed that for any scenario of the game there will always be at least one move available for any of the players.\n\nMoving upward means that the pawn located in (*r*,<=*c*) will go to the cell (*r*<=-<=1,<=*c*), while moving down means the pawn located in (*r*,<=*c*) will go to the cell (*r*<=+<=1,<=*c*). Again, the corresponding cell must be empty, i.e. not occupied by any other pawn of any color.\n\nGiven the initial disposition of the board, determine who wins the game if both players play optimally. Note that there will always be a winner due to the restriction that for any game scenario both players will have some moves available.\nInput specification: The input consists of the board description given in eight lines, each line contains eight characters. Character 'B' is used to denote a black pawn, and character 'W' represents a white pawn. Empty cell is marked with '.'. \n\nIt's guaranteed that there will not be white pawns on the first row neither black pawns on the last row..

Player B needs at least 5 steps for any of his pawns to reach the row 8. Hence, player A will be the winner."}]}}

That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\nThus, \"localization\" will be spelt as \"l10n\", and \"internationalization\u00bb will be spelt as \"i18n\".\n\nYou are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that all too long words should be replaced by the abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any changes.\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100). Each of the following *n* lines contains one word. All the words consist of lowercase Latin letters and possess the lengths of from 1 to 100 characters.. Output specification: Print *n* lines.

Write a python script for the following problem: A Ministry for Defense sent a general to inspect the Super Secret Military Squad under the command of the Colonel SuperDuper. Having learned the news, the colonel ordered to all *n* squad soldiers to line up on the parade ground.\n\nBy the military charter the soldiers should stand in the order of non-increasing of their height. But as there's virtually no time to do that, the soldiers lined up in the arbitrary order. However, the general is rather short-sighted and he thinks that the soldiers lined up correctly if the first soldier in the line has the maximum height and the last soldier has the minimum height. Please note that the way other solders are positioned does not matter, including the case when there are several soldiers whose height is maximum or minimum. Only the heights of the first and the last soldier are important.\n\nFor example, the general considers the sequence of heights (4, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1) correct and the sequence (4, 3, 1, 2, 2) wrong.\n\nWithin one second the colonel can swap any two neighboring soldiers.

That will take 2 seconds. The resulting position of the soldiers is (44, 33, 22, 11).\n\nIn the second sample the colonel may swap the soldiers in the following sequence:\n 1.

Saryozha's present to Dima is that Seryozha won't be in the room and won't disturb Dima and Inna as they celebrate the birthday. Inna's present to Dima is a stack, a queue and a deck.\n\nInna wants her present to show Dima how great a programmer he is. For that, she is going to give Dima commands one by one. There are two types of commands:\n 1.  Add a given number into one of containers. For the queue and the stack, you can add elements only to the end. For the deck, you can add elements to the beginning and to the end. 1.  Extract a number from each of at most three distinct containers.

The array becomes [2,\u20092]. In the second operation Vasya removes two twos at the first and second positions. After that the array becomes empty.\n\nIn the second example Vasya has to perform five operations to make the array empty. In each of them he removes the first element from the array.\n\nIn the third example Vasya needs three operations. In the first operation he removes all integers 4, in the second \u2014 all integers 100, in the third \u2014 all integers 2.\n\nIn the fourth example in the first operation Vasya removes the first two integers 10. After that the array becomes [50,\u200910,\u200950,\u200950]. Then in the second operation Vasya removes the two rightmost integers 50, so that the array becomes [50,\u200910]. In the third operation he removes the remaining 50, and the array becomes [10] after that. In the last, fourth operation he removes the only remaining 10. The array is empty after that."}]}}

Output specification: If Simon wins, print \"0\" (without the quotes), otherwise print \"1\" (without the quotes).\nDemo input: ['3 5 9\\n', '1 1 100\\n'], Demo output: ['0', '1']\nNote: The greatest common divisor of two non-negative integers *a* and *b* is such maximum positive integer *k*, that *a* is divisible by *k* without remainder and similarly, *b* is divisible by *k* without remainder. Let *gcd*(*a*,\u2009*b*) represent the operation of calculating the greatest common divisor of numbers *a* and *b*. Specifically, *gcd*(*x*,\u20090)\u2009=\u2009*gcd*(0,\u2009*x*)\u2009=\u2009*x*.\n\nIn the first sample the game will go like that:\n-  Simon should take *gcd*(3,\u20099)\u2009=\u20093 stones from the heap. After his move the heap has 6 stones left.-  Antisimon should take *gcd*(5,\u20096)\u2009=\u20091 stone from the heap. After his move the heap has 5 stones left.-  Simon should take *gcd*(3,\u20095)\u2009=\u20091 stone from the heap. After his move the heap has 4 stones left.-  Antisimon should take *gcd*(5,\u20094)\u2009=\u20091 stone from the heap. After his move the heap has 3 stones left.-  Simon should take *gcd*(3,\u20093)\u2009=\u20093 stones from the heap. After his move the heap has 0 stones left.-  Antisimon should take *gcd*(5,\u20090)\u2009=\u20095 stones from the heap. As 0\u2009&lt;\u20095, it is impossible and Antisimon loses.\nIn the second sample each player during each move takes one stone from the heap. As *n* is even, Antisimon takes the last stone and Simon can't make a move after that."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: *T* is a complete binary tree consisting of *n* vertices. It means that exactly one vertex is a root, and each vertex is either a leaf (and doesn't have children) or an inner node (and has exactly two children). All leaves of a complete binary tree have the same depth (distance from the root). So *n* is a number such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nIn the picture you can see a complete binary tree with *n*<==<=15.\n\nVertices are numbered from 1 to *n* in a special recursive way: we recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the left subtree (if current vertex is not a leaf), then assign a number to the current vertex, and then recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the right subtree (if it exists). In the picture vertices are numbered exactly using this algorithm. It is clear that for each size of a complete binary tree exists exactly one way to give numbers to all vertices. This way of numbering is called symmetric.\n\nYou have to write a program that for given *n* answers *q* queries to the tree.\n\nEach query consists of an integer number *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) and a string *s**i*, where *u**i* is the number of vertex, and *s**i* represents the path starting from this vertex. String *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U', which mean traverse to the left child, to the right child and to the parent, respectively. Characters from *s**i* have to be processed from left to right, considering that *u**i* is the vertex where the path starts. If it's impossible to process a character (for example, to go to the left child of a leaf), then you have to skip it. The answer is the number of vertex where the path represented by *s**i* ends.\n\nFor example, if *u**i*<==<=4 and *s**i*<==<=\u00abUURL\u00bb, then the answer is 10.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integer numbers *n* and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1018, *q*<=\u2265<=1). *n* is such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nThe next 2*q* lines represent queries; each query consists of two consecutive lines. The first of these two lines contains *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*), the second contains non-empty string *s**i*. *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of *s**i* (for each *i* such that 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*q*) doesn't exceed 105..

How many distinct names are there among them, if two ambiguities described above are taken into account?\n\nFormally, we assume that two words denote the same name, if using the replacements \"u\"\u00a0\u00a0\"oo\" and \"h\"\u00a0\u00a0\"kh\", you can make the words equal. One can make replacements in both directions, in any of the two words an arbitrary number of times.

The second oven can be built in 5 minutes, so after 6 minutes the first oven bakes 4 cakes, the second oven bakes 4 more ovens after 11 minutes. Thus, it is reasonable to build the second oven. \n\nIn the second example it doesn't matter whether we build the second oven or not, thus it takes 12 minutes to bake 8 cakes in both cases. Thus, it is unreasonable to build the second oven.\n\nIn the third example the first oven bakes 11 cakes in 3 minutes, that is more than needed 10. It is unreasonable to build the second oven, because its building takes more time that baking the needed number of cakes using the only oven."}]}}

The grandmother has a large garden, which can be represented as a rectangle 1<=\u00d7<=*n* in size, when viewed from above. This rectangle is divided into *n* equal square sections. The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.\n\nCreating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section. At that, the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section.

Each of the stages is defined by a lowercase Latin letter. This way, the rocket can be described by the string\u00a0\u2014 concatenation of letters, which correspond to the stages.\n\nThere are $n$ stages available. The rocket must contain exactly $k$ of them. Stages in the rocket should be ordered by their weight. So, after the stage with some letter can go only stage with a letter, which is at least two positions after in the alphabet (skipping one letter in between, or even more). For example, after letter 'c' can't go letters 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd', but can go letters 'e', 'f', ..., 'z'.\n\nFor the rocket to fly as far as possible, its weight should be minimal. The weight of the rocket is equal to the sum of the weights of its stages. The weight of the stage is the number of its letter in the alphabet. For example, the stage 'a 'weighs one ton,' b 'weighs two tons, and' z'\u00a0\u2014 $26$ tons.\n\nBuild the rocket with the minimal weight or determine, that it is impossible to build a rocket at all.

Write a python script for the following problem: Reforms continue entering Berland. For example, during yesterday sitting the Berland Parliament approved as much as *n* laws (each law has been assigned a unique number from 1 to *n*). Today all these laws were put on the table of the President of Berland, G.W. Boosch, to be signed.\n\nThis time mr. Boosch plans to sign 2*k* laws. He decided to choose exactly two non-intersecting segments of integers from 1 to *n* of length *k* and sign all laws, whose numbers fall into these segments. More formally, mr. Boosch is going to choose two integers *a*, *b* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*k*<=+<=1,<=*b*<=-<=*a*<=\u2265<=*k*) and sign all laws with numbers lying in the segments [*a*;\u00a0*a*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] and [*b*;\u00a0*b*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] (borders are included).\n\nAs mr. Boosch chooses the laws to sign, he of course considers the public opinion. Allberland Public Opinion Study Centre (APOSC) conducted opinion polls among the citizens, processed the results into a report and gave it to the president. The report contains the absurdity value for each law, in the public opinion. As mr. Boosch is a real patriot, he is keen on signing the laws with the maximum total absurdity. Help him.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105, 0<=&lt;<=2*k*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of laws accepted by the parliament and the length of one segment in the law list, correspondingly. The next line contains *n* integers *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n* \u2014 the absurdity of each law (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=109).. Output specification: Print two integers *a*, *b* \u2014 the beginning of segments that mr. Boosch should choose. That means that the president signs laws with numbers from segments [*a*;\u00a0*a*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] and [*b*;\u00a0*b*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1]. If there are multiple solutions, print the one with the minimum number *a*.

By applying it once to a string, he can swap any two characters of this string. The guys do not know anything about the suffix tree, but it can help them do much more. \n\nBizon the Champion wonders whether the \"Bizons\" can solve the problem. Perhaps, the solution do not require both data structures. Find out whether the guys can solve the problem and if they can, how do they do it?

Monsters eat each other instantly. There are no monsters which are being eaten at the same moment. After the monster *A* eats the monster *B*, the weight of the monster *A* increases by the weight of the eaten monster *B*.

If the *i*-th character is one, Galya has already made a shot to this cell. Otherwise, she hasn't. It is guaranteed that there are exactly *k* ones in this string.. Output specification: In the first line print the minimum number of cells such that if Galya shoot at all of them, she would hit at least one ship.\n\nIn the second line print the cells Galya should shoot at.\n\nEach cell should be printed exactly once. You can print the cells in arbitrary order. The cells are numbered from 1 to *n*, starting from the left.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\nDemo input: ['5 1 2 1\\n00100\\n', '13 3 2 3\\n1000000010001\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n4 2\\n', '2\\n7 11\\n']\nNote: There is one ship in the first sample. It can be either to the left or to the right from the shot Galya has already made (the \"1\" character). So, it is necessary to make two shots: one at the left part, and one at the right part."}]}}

You went on the street with a cup contained water, your favorite drink. In a moment when you were drinking a water you noticed that the process became quite long: the cup still contained water because of rain. You decided to make a formal model of what was happening and to find if it was possible to drink all water in that situation. \n\nThus, your cup is a cylinder with diameter equals *d* centimeters. Initial level of water in cup equals *h* centimeters from the bottom. \n\nYou drink a water with a speed equals *v* milliliters per second.

Write a python script for the following problem: Vasya used to be an accountant before the war began and he is one of the few who knows how to operate a computer, so he was assigned as the programmer.\n\nWe all know that programs often store sets of integers. For example, if we have a problem about a weighted directed graph, its edge can be represented by three integers: the number of the starting vertex, the number of the final vertex and the edge's weight. So, as Vasya was trying to represent characteristics of a recently invented robot in his program, he faced the following problem.\n\nVasya is not a programmer, so he asked his friend Gena, what the convenient way to store *n* integers is. Gena used to code in language X-- and so he can use only the types that occur in this language. Let's define, what a \"type\" is in language X--:\n -  First, a type is a string \"int\". -  Second, a type is a string that starts with \"pair\", then followed by angle brackets listing exactly two comma-separated other types of language X--. This record contains no spaces. -  No other strings can be regarded as types. \nMore formally: type := int | pair&lt;type,type&gt;. For example, Gena uses the following type for graph edges: pair&lt;int,pair&lt;int,int&gt;&gt;.\n\nGena was pleased to help Vasya, he dictated to Vasya a type of language X--, that stores *n* integers. Unfortunately, Gena was in a hurry, so he omitted the punctuation. Now Gena has already left and Vasya can't find the correct punctuation, resulting in a type of language X--, however hard he tries.\n\nHelp Vasya and add the punctuation marks so as to receive the valid type of language X--. Otherwise say that the task is impossible to perform.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105), showing how many numbers the type dictated by Gena contains.\n\nThe second line contains space-separated words, said by Gena. Each of them is either \"pair\" or \"int\" (without the quotes).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total number of words does not exceed 105 and that among all the words that Gena said, there are exactly *n* words \"int\".. Output specification: If it is possible to add the punctuation marks so as to get a correct type of language X-- as a result, print a single line that represents the resulting type. Otherwise, print \"Error occurred\" (without the quotes). Inside the record of a type should not be any extra spaces and other characters. \n\nIt is guaranteed that if such type exists, then it is unique.\n\nNote that you should print the type dictated by Gena (if such type exists) and not any type that can contain *n* values.\nDemo input: ['3\\npair pair int int int\\n', '1\\npair int\\n'], Demo output: ['pair&lt;pair&lt;int,int&gt;,int&gt;', 'Error occurred']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: \n -  alloc n \u2014 to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; \nThe memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.\n\nThe first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.\nInput specification: The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100;1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *t* \u2014 the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* \u2014 the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.. Output specification: Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession.

Of course, in order to not to anger miss Fortune again, the residents placed each snack on the top of the tower immediately as they could do it.\n\nWrite a program that models the behavior of Ankh-Morpork residents.\nInput specification: The first line contains single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the total number of snacks.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers, the *i*-th of them equals the size of the snack which fell on the *i*-th day. Sizes are distinct integers from 1 to *n*.. Output specification: Print *n* lines. On the *i*-th of them print the sizes of the snacks which the residents placed on the top of the Snacktower on the *i*-th day in the order they will do that. If no snack is placed on some day, leave the corresponding line empty.\nDemo input: ['3\\n3 1 2\\n', '5\\n4 5 1 2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n\\xa0\\n2 1', '5 4\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n3 2 1\\n']\nNote: In the example a snack of size 3 fell on the first day, and the residents immediately placed it. On the second day a snack of size 1 fell, and the residents weren't able to place it because they were missing the snack of size 2. On the third day a snack of size 2 fell, and the residents immediately placed it. Right after that they placed the snack of size 1 which had fallen before."}]}}

As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too.

Write a python script for the following problem: The \"Bulls and Cows\" game needs two people to play. The thinker thinks of a number and the guesser tries to guess it.\n\nThe thinker thinks of a four-digit number in the decimal system. All the digits in the number are different and the number may have a leading zero. It can't have more than one leading zero, because all it's digits should be different. The guesser tries to guess the number. He makes a series of guesses, trying experimental numbers and receives answers from the first person in the format \"*x* bulls *y* cows\". *x* represents the number of digits in the experimental number that occupy the same positions as in the sought number. *y* represents the number of digits of the experimental number that present in the sought number, but occupy different positions. Naturally, the experimental numbers, as well as the sought number, are represented by four-digit numbers where all digits are different and a leading zero can be present.\n\nFor example, let's suppose that the thinker thought of the number 0123. Then the guessers' experimental number 1263 will receive a reply \"1 bull 2 cows\" (3 occupies the same positions in both numbers and 1 and 2 are present in both numbers but they occupy different positions). Also, the answer to number 8103 will be \"2 bulls 1 cow\" (analogically, 1 and 3 occupy the same positions and 0 occupies a different one). \n\nWhen the guesser is answered \"4 bulls 0 cows\", the game is over.\n\nNow the guesser has already made several guesses and wants to know whether his next guess can possibly be the last one.\nInput specification: The first input line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=10) which represents the number of already made guesses. Then follow *n* lines in the form of \"*a**i* *b**i* *c**i*\", where *a**i* is the *i*-th experimental number, *b**i* is the number of bulls, *c**i* is the number of cows (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*, 0<=\u2264<=*b**i*,<=*c**i*,<=*b**i*<=+<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=4). The experimental numbers are correct, i.e., each of them contains exactly four digits, in each of them all the four digits are different, and there can be a leading zero. All the experimental numbers are different. As the guesser hasn't guessed the number yet, the answer \"4 bulls 0 cows\" is not present..

Space rescuers know it perfectly well and they are always ready to help anyone who really needs help. All you need to do is call for them. \n\nNow the space rescuers plan to build the largest in the history of the Galaxy rescue station; however, the rescue station's location is yet to be determined. As some cases are real emergencies, the rescuers want to find such a point in the Galaxy from which it would be possible to get to the remotest planet in the minimum possible time. In other words, the rescuers need such point in the space that the distance between it and the planet remotest from it was minimal (if we compare this point with all other possible points in the space). Unfortunately, the rescuers can't sole this problem.\n\nAs the planets are quite remote from each other, they can be considered as points in Euclidean three-dimensional space. The distance between points (*x**i*,<=*y**i*,<=*z**i*) and (*x**j*,<=*y**j*,<=*z**j*) can be calculated by the formula . The rescue station can be positioned in any point in the space.

Having learned the news, the colonel ordered to all *n* squad soldiers to line up on the parade ground.\n\nBy the military charter the soldiers should stand in the order of non-increasing of their height. But as there's virtually no time to do that, the soldiers lined up in the arbitrary order.

Please note that the way other solders are positioned does not matter, including the case when there are several soldiers whose height is maximum or minimum. Only the heights of the first and the last soldier are important.\n\nFor example, the general considers the sequence of heights (4, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1) correct and the sequence (4, 3, 1, 2, 2) wrong.\n\nWithin one second the colonel can swap any two neighboring soldiers.

Write a python script for the following problem: Bob is a farmer. He has a large pasture with many sheep. Recently, he has lost some of them due to wolf attacks. He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of dogs.\nDemo input: ['6 6\\n..S...\\n..S.W.\\n.S....\\n..W...\\n...W..\\n......\\n', '1 2\\nSW\\n', '5 5\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS....\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n..SD..\\n..SDW.\\n.SD...\\n.DW...\\nDD.W..\\n......\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS.D..\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n']\nNote: In the first example, we can split the pasture into two halves, one containing wolves and one containing sheep. Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

During the *i*-th competition the participant must as quickly as possible complete a ride along a straight line from point *s**i* to point *f**i* (*s**i*<=&lt;<=*f**i*).\n\nMeasuring time is a complex process related to usage of a special sensor and a time counter. Think of the front wheel of a bicycle as a circle of radius *r*. Let's neglect the thickness of a tire, the size of the sensor, and all physical effects. The sensor is placed on the rim of the wheel, that is, on some fixed point on a circle of radius *r*. After that the counter moves just like the chosen point of the circle, i.e. moves forward and rotates around the center of the circle.\n\nAt the beginning each participant can choose any point *b**i*, such that his bike is fully behind the starting line, that is, *b**i*<=&lt;<=*s**i*<=-<=*r*. After that, he starts the movement, instantly accelerates to his maximum speed and at time *ts**i*, when the coordinate of the sensor is equal to the coordinate of the start, the time counter starts. The cyclist makes a complete ride, moving with his maximum speed and at the moment the sensor's coordinate is equal to the coordinate of the finish (moment of time *tf**i*), the time counter deactivates and records the final time. Thus, the counter records that the participant made a complete ride in time *tf**i*<=-<=*ts**i*.\n\nMaxim is good at math and he suspects that the total result doesn't only depend on his maximum speed *v*, but also on his choice of the initial point *b**i*. Now Maxim is asking you to calculate for each of *n* competitions the minimum possible time that can be measured by the time counter. The radius of the wheel of his bike is equal to *r*.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *r* and *v* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000,<=1<=\u2264<=*r*,<=*v*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 the number of competitions, the radius of the front wheel of Max's bike and his maximum speed, respectively. \n\nNext *n* lines contain the descriptions of the contests.

Both numbers are even, so Valera doesn't required to do anything.\n\nIn the second sample Valera has only one piece of domino. It is written 3 on the one of its halves, therefore one of the sums will always be odd.\n\nIn the third case Valera can rotate the first piece, and after that the sum on the upper halves will be equal to 10, and the sum on the lower halves will be equal to 8."}]}}

All roads are 1 kilometer long. It is initially possible to travel from a city to any other city using these roads. The country also has *k* police stations located in some cities. In particular, the city's structure satisfies the requirement enforced by the previously mentioned law.

Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*.

The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) portal connects cell *i* and cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*), and one can travel from cell *i* to cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) using the *i*-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) to cell *i* using the *i*-th portal. It is easy to see that because of condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* one can't leave the Line World using portals.\n\nCurrently, I am standing at cell 1, and I want to go to cell *t*.

The water can only be present in the empty squares. The tap is positioned above the square (*x*,<=*y*) of the first layer, it is guaranteed that this square is empty. Every minute a cubical unit of water falls into the plate. Find out in how many minutes the Serial Guy should unglue himself from the soap opera and turn the water off for it not to overfill the plate. That is, you should find the moment of time when the plate is absolutely full and is going to be overfilled in the next moment.\n\nNote: the water fills all the area within reach (see sample 4).

And you should print a solution about how to do it.\"\n\nBut Drazil doesn't like to write special checking program for this task. His friend, Varda advised him: \"how about asking contestant only to print the solution when it exists and it is unique? Otherwise contestant may print 'Not unique' \".\n\nDrazil found that the constraints for this task may be much larger than for the original task!\n\nCan you solve this new problem?\n\nNote that you should print 'Not unique' either when there exists no solution or when there exists several different solutions for the original task.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=2000).\n\nThe following *n* lines describe the grid rows. Character '.' denotes an empty cell, and the character '*' denotes a cell that is occupied.. Output specification: If there is no solution or the solution is not unique, you should print the string \"Not unique\".\n\nOtherwise you should print how to cover all empty cells with 1<=\u00d7<=2 tiles. Use characters \"&lt;&gt;\" to denote horizontal tiles and characters \"^v\" to denote vertical tiles. Refer to the sample test for the output format example.\nDemo input: ['3 3\\n...\\n.*.\\n...\\n', '4 4\\n..**\\n*...\\n*.**\\n....\\n', '2 4\\n*..*\\n....\\n', '1 1\\n.\\n', '1 1\\n*\\n'], Demo output: ['Not unique\\n', '&lt;&gt;**\\n*^&lt;&gt;\\n*v**\\n&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;\\n', '*&lt;&gt;*\\n&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;\\n', 'Not unique\\n', '*\\n']\nNote: In the first case, there are indeed two solutions:\n\nand\n\nso the answer is \"Not unique\"."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Felix the Robot is preparing for a probability theory exam. Unfortunately, during the semester, he took a course of the belles-lettres instead of studying the subject, so now he does not know the answer to any of the upcoming exam's questions. One thing is for sure: Felix needs help!\n\nThe exam for robots is an online event. It consists of *n*<==<=5000 questions each of which has only two possible answers: \"yes\" and \"no\". A robot can attempt to pass the exam at most *x*<==<=100 times. The questions, their order and right answers don't change from one attempt to another. Once the exam starts, Felix will get just a few seconds for all his attempts, and he can't learn the right answers so fast.\n\nThe robot will try to pass the exam in the following way. First, Felix fixes the answers for all questions. The result is a string of *n* bits: answers for the first, second, ..., *n*-th questions. In this string, 0 means that the answer is \"no\", and 1 is for \"yes\". Then he answers the questions according to this string, spending one attempt. After that, Felix can fix another string of *n* bits and make another attempt, and so on until there are no more attempts.\n\nIn the online system for exam, the following optimization is implemented: if at some moment of time, the examinee already got *k*<==<=2000 answers wrong, the attempt is immediately terminated with the corresponding message. For Felix, this means that the remaining bits in the string he fixed are ignored. If there were strictly less than *k* wrong answers for all *n* questions, the exam is considered passed.\n\nThe result of an attempt is a number from *k* to *n* inclusive: the number of questions after which the attempt was terminated. If the exam is passed, this number is considered to be *n*<=+<=1. The exam result is the highest result among all attempts. If there were no attempts, the exam result is zero.\n\nYour task is to write a program which will determine the bit strings for all attempts Felix makes. After each attempt, your program will get its result immediately. Help Felix get the highest exam result you can!\n\nInteraction Protocol\n\nYour solution can make from 0 to *x* attempts inclusive. To make an attempt, print a string to the standard output. The string must consist of exactly *n* binary digits without spaces and end with a newline character.\n\nTo prevent output buffering, after printing a string, insert a command to flush the buffer: for example, it can be fflush\u00a0(stdout) in C or C++, System.out.flush\u00a0() in Java, flush\u00a0(output) in Pascal or sys.stdout.flush\u00a0() in Python.\n\nAfter each attempt you make, you can immediately read its result from the standard input. The result is an integer from *k* to *n*<=+<=1 inclusive, followed by a newline character.\n\nScoring System\n\nA test is defined by a string of *n* binary digits: the right answers to *n* questions. This string is kept secret from the solution. Each test is evaluated separately.\n\nIf a solution followed the interaction protocol and terminated correctly on a test, it gets a score of *max* (0,<=*S*<=-<=4000) where *S* is the exam result. Otherwise, the solution gets zero score for the test.\n\nTesting\n\nYour solution will be checked on sets of tests generated in advance. Each test is created using a pseudo-random number generator. You can consider that the answers are uniformly distributed (the probabilities of digits 0 and 1 are the same) and mutually independent (the probabilities of all 2*n* possible strings are the same). A solution gets the score which is the sum of its score on all the tests.\n\nDuring the main phase of the contest, there are two ways to send a solution for checking.\n -  The first one is to check on examples. There are 10 example tests which are also available for local testing. As soon as the solution is checked, you can see reports for all examples by clicking on the submission result.-  The second way is to check on preliminary tests. There are 100 preliminary tests which are generated in advance but kept secret. The score for preliminary tests (but not for example tests) is used in the preliminary scoreboard. This score does not affect the final results, but nevertheless allows to roughly compare a solution with others. \nAfter the main phase ends, for each participant, the system chooses the final solution:\n -  consider all solutions sent for preliminary testing; -  choose the ones which got a total score strictly greater than zero; -  define the final solution as the one of chosen solutions which has the latest submission time. \nNote that the solutions sent only to be checked on examples are not considered when choosing the final solution.\n\nDuring the final testing, all final solutions will be checked on the same large set of a large number (<=\u2248<=1000) of final tests. The score for final tests determines the final scoreboard. The winner is the contestant whose solution gets the highest total score. In case two or more participants have equal total score, the contestants with such score tie for the same place.\n\nA package for local development is available on GitHub at the following address: [https://github.com/GassaFM/online-exam](https://github.com/GassaFM/online-exam). You can download sources or the latest release: [https://github.com/GassaFM/online-exam/releases](https://github.com/GassaFM/online-exam/releases).\n\nExample\n\nTo have an example which fits into the problem statement, let *n*<==<=10, *k*<==<=2, and *x*<==<=3 (recall that in the real problem, *n*<==<=5000, *k*<==<=2000, and *x*<==<=100, so this example is not a correct test for the problem). Let the right answers be defined by the string 1010001111. Before any attempts are made, the exam result is zero.\n\nConsider a solution making three attempts.\n\nLet the first attempt be defined by the string 0100100100. The result of this attempt is the number 2: the first wrong answer is the answer to the first question, and the second is to the second question. The exam result at this moment is 2.\n\nLet the second attempt be defined by the string 1010101010. The result of this attempt is the number 8: the first wrong answer is the answer to the fifth question, and the second is to the eighth question. The exam result at this moment is 8.\n\nLet the second attempt be defined by the string 1001011001. The result of this attempt is the number 4: the first wrong answer is the answer to the third question, and the second is to the fourth question. The exam result at this moment is still 8.\n\nAs *x*<==<=3 in our example, further attempts are impossible, so if the solution terminates correctly, the exam result is 8.\n\nNow consider another solution making two attempts.\n\nLet the first attempt be defined by the string 1010001110. Its result is the number 11: the first and only wrong answer is the answer to the tenth question, *k*<==<=2, so the exam is considered passed.\n\nLet the first attempt be defined by the string 0000011111. Its result is the number 3: the first wrong answer is the answer to the first question, and the second one is to the third question.\n\nIf the solution terminates correctly after the above two attempts, the exam result is 11.\nInput specification: none. Output specification: none\nDemo input: [], Demo output: []\nNote: none"}]}}

But doing nothing the whole day turned out to be too boring, and he decided to play a game with pebbles. Initially, the Beaver has *n* pebbles. He arranges them in *a* equal rows, each row has *b* pebbles (*a*<=&gt;<=1).

Then he arranges all his pebbles again (possibly choosing other values of *a* and *b*) and takes back one row, and so on. The game continues until at some point the Beaver ends up with exactly one pebble. \n\nThe game process can be represented as a finite sequence of integers *c*1,<=...,<=*c**k*, where: \n -  *c*1<==<=*n* -  *c**i*<=+<=1 is the number of pebbles that the Beaver ends up with after the *i*-th move, that is, the number of pebbles in a row after some arrangement of *c**i* pebbles (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*k*).

Then *c*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>\u2009=\u20091, and the game ends after the first move with the result of 11. -  Arrange the pebbles in 5 rows, two pebbles per row. Then *c*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>\u2009=\u20092, and the game continues.

Write a python script for the following problem: Let's dive into one of the most interesting areas of magic \u2014 writing spells. Learning this exciting but challenging science is very troublesome, so now you will not learn the magic words, but only get to know the basic rules of writing spells.\n\nEach spell consists of several lines. The line, whose first non-space character is character \"#\" is an amplifying line and it is responsible for spell power. The remaining lines are common, and determine the effect of the spell.\n\nYou came across the text of some spell. Spell was too long, so you cannot understand its meaning. So you want to make it as short as possible without changing the meaning.\n\nThe only way to shorten a spell that you know is the removal of some spaces and line breaks. We know that when it comes to texts of spells, the spaces carry meaning only in the amplifying lines, so we should remove all spaces in other lines. Newlines also do not matter, unless any of the two separated lines is amplifying. Thus, if two consecutive lines are not amplifying, they need to be joined into one (i.e. we should concatenate the second line to the first one). Removing spaces in amplifying lines and concatenating the amplifying lines to anything is forbidden.\n\nNote that empty lines must be processed just like all the others: they must be joined to the adjacent non-amplifying lines, or preserved in the output, if they are surrounded with amplifying lines on both sides (i.e. the line above it, if there is one, is amplifying, and the line below it, if there is one, is amplifying too).\n\nFor now those are the only instructions for removing unnecessary characters that you have to follow (oh yes, a newline is a character, too).\n\nThe input contains the text of the spell, which should be reduced. Remove the extra characters and print the result to the output.\nInput specification: The input contains multiple lines. All characters in the lines have codes from 32 to 127 (inclusive). Please note that the lines may begin with or end with one or more spaces. The size of the input does not exceed 1048576 (<==<=220) bytes. Newlines are included in this size.\n\nIn the Windows operating system used on the testing computer, a newline is a sequence of characters with codes #13#10. It is guaranteed that after each line of input there is a newline. In particular, the input ends with a newline. Note that the newline is the end of the line, and not the beginning of the next one.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the input contains at least one character other than a newline.\n\nIt is recommended to organize the input-output line by line, in this case the newlines will be processed correctly by the language means.. Output specification: Print the text of the spell where all extra characters are deleted. Please note that each output line should be followed by a newline.\n\nPlease be careful: your answers will be validated by comparing them to the jury's answer byte-by-byte. So, all spaces and newlines matter.\nDemo input: ['#   include &lt;cstdio&gt;\\n\\nusing namespace std;\\n\\nint main     (   ){\\nputs(\"Hello # World\"); #\\n#\\n}\\n', '#\\n\\n#\\n'], Demo output: ['#   include &lt;cstdio&gt;\\nusingnamespacestd;intmain(){puts(\"Hello#World\");#\\n#\\n}\\n', '#\\n\\n#\\n']\nNote: In the first sample the amplifying lines are lines 1 and 7. So, lines 2 to 6 are concatenated to each other, all spaces are deleted from them.\n\nIn the second sample the amplifying lines are lines 1 and 3. So, no lines are concatenated to each other."}]}}

For example, if the above mentioned club has short name \"DIB\", then no club for which the first option is chosen can have short name equal to \"DIN\". However, it is possible that some club have short name \"DIN\", where \"DI\" are the first two letters of the team's name, and \"N\" is the first letter of hometown's name.

It's known that any two computers connected by cable directly or through other computers\n\nPolycarpus decided to find out the network's topology. A network topology is the way of describing the network configuration, the scheme that shows the location and the connections of network devices.\n\nPolycarpus knows three main network topologies: bus, ring and star. A bus is the topology that represents a shared cable with all computers connected with it. In the ring topology the cable connects each computer only with two other ones. A star is the topology where all computers of a network are connected to the single central node.\n\nLet's represent each of these network topologies as a connected non-directed graph. A bus is a connected graph that is the only path, that is, the graph where all nodes are connected with two other ones except for some two nodes that are the beginning and the end of the path. A ring is a connected graph, where all nodes are connected with two other ones. A star is a connected graph, where a single central node is singled out and connected with all other nodes. For clarifications, see the picture.\n\nYou've got a connected non-directed graph that characterizes the computer network in Polycarpus' corporation.

It is supposed to conduct exactly *x*\u00b7*y* tests, each time a mine is installed into a square that has never been used before. The starting cell of the robot always remains the same.\n\nAfter placing the objects on the field the robot will have to run a sequence of commands given by string *s*, consisting only of characters 'L', 'R', 'U', 'D'. These commands tell the robot to move one square to the left, to the right, up or down, or stay idle if moving in the given direction is impossible.

Also, he carefully wrote down all the operations and their results to his event log, following the format: \n -  insert *x*\u00a0\u2014 put the element with value *x* in the heap; -  getMin *x*\u00a0\u2014 the value of the minimum element contained in the heap was equal to *x*; -  removeMin\u00a0\u2014 the minimum element was extracted from the heap (only one instance, if there were many). \nAll the operations were correct, i.e. there was at least one element in the heap each time getMin or removeMin operations were applied.\n\nWhile Petya was away for a lunch, his little brother Vova came to the room, took away some of the pages from Petya's log and used them to make paper boats.\n\nNow Vova is worried, if he made Petya's sequence of operations inconsistent. For example, if one apply operations one-by-one in the order they are written in the event log, results of getMin operations might differ from the results recorded by Petya, and some of getMin or removeMin operations may be incorrect, as the heap is empty at the moment they are applied.\n\nNow Vova wants to add some new operation records to the event log in order to make the resulting sequence of operations correct.

Write a python script for the following problem: In a far away kingdom lived the King, the Prince, the Shoemaker, the Dressmaker and many other citizens. They lived happily until great trouble came into the Kingdom. The ACMers settled there.\n\nMost damage those strange creatures inflicted upon the kingdom was that they loved high precision numbers. As a result, the Kingdom healers had already had three appointments with the merchants who were asked to sell, say, exactly 0.273549107 beer barrels. To deal with the problem somehow, the King issued an order obliging rounding up all numbers to the closest integer to simplify calculations. Specifically, the order went like this:\n-  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is strictly less than 0.5, then the rounded up number coincides with the number\u2019s integer part. -  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is not less than 0.5, the rounded up number is obtained if we add 1 to the last digit of the number\u2019s integer part.-  If the number\u2019s integer part ends with digit 9, to round up the numbers one should go to Vasilisa the Wise. In the whole Kingdom she is the only one who can perform the tricky operation of carrying into the next position. \nMerchants found the algorithm very sophisticated and they asked you (the ACMers) to help them. Can you write a program that would perform the rounding according to the King\u2019s order?\nInput specification: The first line contains a single number to round up \u2014 the integer part (a non-empty set of decimal digits that do not start with 0 \u2014 with the exception of a case when the set consists of a single digit \u2014 in this case 0 can go first), then follows character \u00ab.\u00bb (a dot), and then follows the fractional part (any non-empty set of decimal digits). The number's length does not exceed 1000 characters, including the dot. There are no other characters in the input data.. Output specification: If the last number of the integer part is not equal to 9, print the rounded-up number without leading zeroes. Otherwise, print the message \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" (without the quotes).\nDemo input: ['0.0\\n', '1.49\\n', '1.50\\n', '2.71828182845904523536\\n', '3.14159265358979323846\\n', '12345678901234567890.1\\n', '123456789123456789.999\\n'], Demo output: ['0', '1', '2', '3', '3', '12345678901234567890', 'GOTO Vasilisa.']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Let\u2019s define a grid to be a set of tiles with 2 rows and 13 columns. Each tile has an English letter written in it. The letters don't have to be unique: there might be two or more tiles with the same letter written on them. Here is an example of a grid:\n\nWe say that two tiles are adjacent if they share a side or a corner. In the example grid above, the tile with the letter 'A' is adjacent only to the tiles with letters 'B', 'N', and 'O'. A tile is not adjacent to itself.\n\nA sequence of tiles is called a path if each tile in the sequence is adjacent to the tile which follows it (except for the last tile in the sequence, which of course has no successor). In this example, \"ABC\" is a path, and so is \"KXWIHIJK\". \"MAB\" is not a path because 'M' is not adjacent to 'A'. A single tile can be used more than once by a path (though the tile cannot occupy two consecutive places in the path because no tile is adjacent to itself).\n\nYou\u2019re given a string *s* which consists of 27 upper-case English letters. Each English letter occurs at least once in *s*. Find a grid that contains a path whose tiles, viewed in the order that the path visits them, form the string *s*. If there\u2019s no solution, print \"Impossible\" (without the quotes).\nInput specification: The only line of the input contains the string *s*, consisting of 27 upper-case English letters.

Write a python script for the following problem: When Valera was playing football on a stadium, it suddenly began to rain. Valera hid in the corridor under the grandstand not to get wet. However, the desire to play was so great that he decided to train his hitting the ball right in this corridor. Valera went back far enough, put the ball and hit it. The ball bounced off the walls, the ceiling and the floor corridor and finally hit the exit door. As the ball was wet, it left a spot on the door. Now Valera wants to know the coordinates for this spot.\n\nLet's describe the event more formally. The ball will be considered a point in space. The door of the corridor will be considered a rectangle located on plane *xOz*, such that the lower left corner of the door is located at point (0,<=0,<=0), and the upper right corner is located at point (*a*,<=0,<=*b*) . The corridor will be considered as a rectangular parallelepiped, infinite in the direction of increasing coordinates of *y*. In this corridor the floor will be considered as plane *xOy*, and the ceiling as plane, parallel to *xOy* and passing through point (*a*,<=0,<=*b*). We will also assume that one of the walls is plane *yOz*, and the other wall is plane, parallel to *yOz* and passing through point (*a*,<=0,<=*b*).\n\nWe'll say that the ball hit the door when its coordinate *y* was equal to 0. Thus the coordinates of the spot are point (*x*0,<=0,<=*z*0), where 0<=\u2264<=*x*0<=\u2264<=*a*,<=0<=\u2264<=*z*0<=\u2264<=*b*. To hit the ball, Valera steps away from the door at distance *m* and puts the ball in the center of the corridor at point . After the hit the ball flies at speed (*v**x*,<=*v**y*,<=*v**z*). This means that if the ball has coordinates (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*), then after one second it will have coordinates (*x*<=+<=*v**x*,<=*y*<=+<=*v**y*,<=*z*<=+<=*v**z*).\n\nSee image in notes for clarification.\n\nWhen the ball collides with the ceiling, the floor or a wall of the corridor, it bounces off in accordance with the laws of reflection (the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection). In the problem we consider the ideal physical model, so we can assume that there is no air resistance, friction force, or any loss of energy.\nInput specification: The first line contains three space-separated integers *a*,<=*b*,<=*m* (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100). The first two integers specify point (*a*,<=0,<=*b*), through which the ceiling and one of the corridor walls pass. The third integer is the distance at which Valera went away from the door.\n\nThe second line has three space-separated integers *v**x*,<=*v**y*,<=*v**z* (|*v**x*|,<=|*v**y*|,<=|*v**z*|<=\u2264<=100,<=*v**y*<=&lt;<=0,<=*v**z*<=\u2265<=0) \u2014 the speed of the ball after the hit.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the ball hits the door.. Output specification: Print two real numbers *x*0,<=*z*0 \u2014 the *x* and *z* coordinates of point (*x*0,<=0,<=*z*0), at which the ball hits the exit door.

Menshykov, Uslada and Horace decided to make either an elephant or a bear from those sticks. They can make an animal from sticks in the following way: \n -  Four sticks represent the animal's legs, these sticks should have the same length. -  Two remaining sticks represent the animal's head and body. The bear's head stick must be shorter than the body stick. The elephant, however, has a long trunk, so his head stick must be as long as the body stick. Note that there are no limits on the relations between the leg sticks and the head and body sticks. \nYour task is to find out which animal can be made from the given stick set.

For example, expression 78<=+<=87 in the base 16 positional notation is equal to *FF*16, in the base 15 positional notation it is equal to 11015, in the base 10 one \u2014 to 16510, in the base 9 one \u2014 to 1769, and in the base 8 or lesser-based positional notations the expression is invalid as all the numbers should be strictly less than the positional notation base.

To become a cool programmer, he needs at least *p* experience points, and a desired flat in Moscow costs *q* dollars. Mikhail is determined to follow his dreams and registered at a freelance site.\n\nHe has suggestions to work on *n* distinct projects. Mikhail has already evaluated that the participation in the *i*-th project will increase his experience by *a**i* per day and bring *b**i* dollars per day. As freelance work implies flexible working hours, Mikhail is free to stop working on one project at any time and start working on another project. Doing so, he receives the respective share of experience and money. Mikhail is only trying to become a cool programmer, so he is able to work only on one project at any moment of time.\n\nFind the real value, equal to the minimum number of days Mikhail needs to make his dream come true.\n\nFor example, suppose Mikhail is suggested to work on three projects and *a*1<==<=6, *b*1<==<=2, *a*2<==<=1, *b*2<==<=3, *a*3<==<=2, *b*3<==<=6.

Write a python script for the following problem: The mobile application store has a new game called \"Subway Roller\".\n\nThe protagonist of the game Philip is located in one end of the tunnel and wants to get out of the other one. The tunnel is a rectangular field consisting of three rows and *n* columns. At the beginning of the game the hero is in some cell of the leftmost column. Some number of trains rides towards the hero. Each train consists of two or more neighbouring cells in some row of the field.\n\nAll trains are moving from right to left at a speed of two cells per second, and the hero runs from left to right at the speed of one cell per second. For simplicity, the game is implemented so that the hero and the trains move in turns. First, the hero moves one cell to the right, then one square up or down, or stays idle. Then all the trains move twice simultaneously one cell to the left. Thus, in one move, Philip definitely makes a move to the right and can move up or down. If at any point, Philip is in the same cell with a train, he loses. If the train reaches the left column, it continues to move as before, leaving the tunnel.\n\nYour task is to answer the question whether there is a sequence of movements of Philip, such that he would be able to get to the rightmost column.\nInput specification: Each test contains from one to ten sets of the input data. The first line of the test contains a single integer *t* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=10 for pretests and tests or *t*<==<=1 for hacks; see the Notes section for details) \u2014 the number of sets.\n\nThen follows the description of *t* sets of the input data. \n\nThe first line of the description of each set contains two integers *n*,<=*k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100,<=1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=26) \u2014 the number of columns on the field and the number of trains. Each of the following three lines contains the sequence of *n* character, representing the row of the field where the game is on. Philip's initial position is marked as 's', he is in the leftmost column. Each of the *k* trains is marked by some sequence of identical uppercase letters of the English alphabet, located in one line. Distinct trains are represented by distinct letters. Character '.' represents an empty cell, that is, the cell that doesn't contain either Philip or the trains.. Output specification: For each set of the input data print on a single line word YES, if it is possible to win the game and word NO otherwise.\nDemo input: ['2\\n16 4\\n...AAAAA........\\ns.BBB......CCCCC\\n........DDDDD...\\n16 4\\n...AAAAA........\\ns.BBB....CCCCC..\\n.......DDDDD....\\n', '2\\n10 4\\ns.ZZ......\\n.....AAABB\\n.YYYYYY...\\n10 4\\ns.ZZ......\\n....AAAABB\\n.YYYYYY...\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\nNO\\n', 'YES\\nNO\\n']\nNote: In the first set of the input of the first sample Philip must first go forward and go down to the third row of the field, then go only forward, then go forward and climb to the second row, go forward again and go up to the first row. After that way no train blocks Philip's path, so he can go straight to the end of the tunnel.\n\nNote that in this problem the challenges are restricted to tests that contain only one testset."}]}}

These *k* dots are different: if *i*<=\u2260<=*j* then *d**i* is different from *d**j*. 1.  *k* is at least 4. 1.  All dots belong to the same color. 1.  For all 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*k*<=-<=1: *d**i* and *d**i*<=+<=1 are adjacent. Also, *d**k* and *d*1 should also be adjacent. Cells *x* and *y* are called adjacent if they share an edge. \nDetermine if there exists a cycle on the field.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=50): the number of rows and columns of the board.\n\nThen *n* lines follow, each line contains a string consisting of *m* characters, expressing colors of dots in each line. Each character is an uppercase Latin letter.. Output specification: Output \"Yes\" if there exists a cycle, and \"No\" otherwise.\nDemo input: ['3 4\\nAAAA\\nABCA\\nAAAA\\n', '3 4\\nAAAA\\nABCA\\nAADA\\n', '4 4\\nYYYR\\nBYBY\\nBBBY\\nBBBY\\n', '7 6\\nAAAAAB\\nABBBAB\\nABAAAB\\nABABBB\\nABAAAB\\nABBBAB\\nAAAAAB\\n', '2 13\\nABCDEFGHIJKLM\\nNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n', 'Yes\\n', 'No\\n']\nNote: In first sample test all 'A' form a cycle.\n\nIn second sample there is no such cycle.\n\nThe third sample is displayed on the picture above ('Y' = Yellow, 'B' = Blue, 'R' = Red)."}]}}

Instead of improving the demographic situation, they decided to achieve its goal by expanding the boundaries of the city.\n\nThe city of Tomsk can be represented as point on the plane with coordinates (0; 0). The city is surrounded with *n* other locations, the *i*-th one has coordinates (*x**i*, *y**i*) with the population of *k**i* people. You can widen the city boundaries to a circle of radius *r*.

Write a python script for the following problem: Limak is a little polar bear. Polar bears hate long strings and thus they like to compress them. You should also know that Limak is so young that he knows only first six letters of the English alphabet: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' and 'f'.\n\nYou are given a set of *q* possible operations. Limak can perform them in any order, any operation may be applied any number of times. The *i*-th operation is described by a string *a**i* of length two and a string *b**i* of length one. No two of *q* possible operations have the same string *a**i*.\n\nWhen Limak has a string *s* he can perform the *i*-th operation on *s* if the first two letters of *s* match a two-letter string *a**i*. Performing the *i*-th operation removes first two letters of *s* and inserts there a string *b**i*. See the notes section for further clarification.\n\nYou may note that performing an operation decreases the length of a string *s* exactly by 1. Also, for some sets of operations there may be a string that cannot be compressed any further, because the first two letters don't match any *a**i*.\n\nLimak wants to start with a string of length *n* and perform *n*<=-<=1 operations to finally get a one-letter string \"a\". In how many ways can he choose the starting string to be able to get \"a\"? Remember that Limak can use only letters he knows.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *q* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=6, 1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=36)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the initial string and the number of available operations.\n\nThe next *q* lines describe the possible operations.

It's guaranteed that *a**i*<=\u2260<=*a**j* for *i*<=\u2260<=*j* and that all *a**i* and *b**i* consist of only first six lowercase English letters..

The first operation would change \"abb\" to \"ab\" and the second operation would change \"ab\" to \"a\".\n\nOther three strings may be compressed as follows: \n -  \"cab\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ab\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"a\" -  \"cca\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ca\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"a\" -  \"eea\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ca\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"a\" \nIn the second sample, the only correct initial string is \"eb\" because it can be immediately compressed to \"a\"."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Imagine that you have a twin brother or sister. Having another person that looks exactly like you seems very unusual. It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.\n\nNow let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins. The second line contains a sequence of *n* integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the coins' values. All numbers are separated with spaces.. Output specification: In the single line print the single number \u2014 the minimum needed number of coins.\nDemo input: ['2\\n3 3\\n', '3\\n2 1 2\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: In the first sample you will have to take 2 coins (you and your twin have sums equal to 6,\u20090 correspondingly). If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too. You can pick coins with values 1,\u20092 or 2,\u20092. In any case, the minimum number of coins equals 2."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Natasha is going to fly on a rocket to Mars and return to Earth. Also, on the way to Mars, she will land on $n - 2$ intermediate planets. Formally: we number all the planets from $1$ to $n$. $1$ is Earth, $n$ is Mars. Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt. Assume, that the rocket takes off and lands instantly.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 number of planets.\n\nThe second line contains the only integer $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 weight of the payload.\n\nThe third line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$), where $a_i$ is the number of tons, which can be lifted off by one ton of fuel.\n\nThe fourth line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le 1000$), where $b_i$ is the number of tons, which can be landed by one ton of fuel. \n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel.. Output specification: If Natasha can fly to Mars through $(n - 2)$ planets and return to Earth, print the minimum mass of fuel (in tons) that Natasha should take. Otherwise, print a single number $-1$.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel.\n\nThe answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $10^{-6}$. Formally, let your answer be $p$, and the jury's answer be $q$. Your answer is considered correct if $\\frac{|p - q|}{\\max{(1, |q|)}} \\le 10^{-6}$.\nDemo input: ['2\\n12\\n11 8\\n7 5\\n', '3\\n1\\n1 4 1\\n2 5 3\\n', '6\\n2\\n4 6 3 3 5 6\\n2 6 3 6 5 3\\n'], Demo output: ['10.0000000000\\n', '-1\\n', '85.4800000000\\n']\nNote: Let's consider the first example.\n\nInitially, the mass of a rocket with fuel is $22$ tons.\n-  At take-off from Earth one ton of fuel can lift off $11$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $22$ tons you need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons.-  During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining.-  While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. There will be $14$ tons of rocket with fuel after that.-  During landing on Earth, one ton of fuel can land $7$ tons of cargo, so for landing $14$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight is $12$ tons, that is, a rocket without any fuel.\nIn the second case, the rocket will not be able even to take off from Earth."}]}}

The computer network of this corporation consists of *n* computers, some of them are connected by a cable. The computers are indexed by integers from 1 to *n*. It's known that any two computers connected by cable directly or through other computers\n\nPolycarpus decided to find out the network's topology. A network topology is the way of describing the network configuration, the scheme that shows the location and the connections of network devices.\n\nPolycarpus knows three main network topologies: bus, ring and star. A bus is the topology that represents a shared cable with all computers connected with it. In the ring topology the cable connects each computer only with two other ones. A star is the topology where all computers of a network are connected to the single central node.\n\nLet's represent each of these network topologies as a connected non-directed graph. A bus is a connected graph that is the only path, that is, the graph where all nodes are connected with two other ones except for some two nodes that are the beginning and the end of the path. A ring is a connected graph, where all nodes are connected with two other ones. A star is a connected graph, where a single central node is singled out and connected with all other nodes. For clarifications, see the picture.\n\nYou've got a connected non-directed graph that characterizes the computer network in Polycarpus' corporation.

Karlsson was not going to be hungry any longer, so he decided to get some food in the house.\n\nKarlsson's gaze immediately fell on *n* wooden cupboards, standing in the kitchen. He immediately realized that these cupboards have hidden jam stocks. Karlsson began to fly greedily around the kitchen, opening and closing the cupboards' doors, grab and empty all the jars of jam that he could find.\n\nAnd now all jars of jam are empty, Karlsson has had enough and does not want to leave traces of his stay, so as not to let down his friend. Each of the cupboards has two doors: the left one and the right one. Karlsson remembers that when he rushed to the kitchen, all the cupboards' left doors were in the same position (open or closed), similarly, all the cupboards' right doors were in the same position (open or closed). Karlsson wants the doors to meet this condition as well by the time the family returns. Karlsson does not remember the position of all the left doors, also, he cannot remember the position of all the right doors. Therefore, it does not matter to him in what position will be all left or right doors. It is important to leave all the left doors in the same position, and all the right doors in the same position. For example, all the left doors may be closed, and all the right ones may be open.\n\nKarlsson needs one second to open or close a door of a cupboard.

Allberland Public Opinion Study Centre (APOSC) conducted opinion polls among the citizens, processed the results into a report and gave it to the president.

If the number of points meeting the conditions is more than one, the point with the maximum angle of observation is prefered. \n\nWould you, please, help the famous Berland commentator G. Berniev to find the best point of observation. It should be noted, that the stadiums do not hide each other, the commentator can easily see one stadium through the other.\nInput specification: The input data consists of three lines, each of them describes the position of one stadium. The lines have the format *x*,<=<=*y*,<=<=*r*, where (*x*,<=*y*) are the coordinates of the stadium's center (<=-<=<=103<=\u2264<=*x*,<=<=*y*<=\u2264<=103), and *r* (1<=\u2264<=*r*<=<=\u2264<=103) is its radius. All the numbers in the input data are integer, stadiums do not have common points, and their centers are not on the same line.. Output specification: Print the coordinates of the required point with five digits after the decimal point. If there is no answer meeting the conditions, the program shouldn't print anything. The output data should be left blank.\nDemo input: ['0 0 10\\n60 0 10\\n30 30 10\\n'], Demo output: ['30.00000 0.00000\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

She imagined the situation that is described below.\n\nThere are *n* trees located along the road at points with coordinates *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n*. Each tree has its height *h**i*. Woodcutters can cut down a tree and fell it to the left or to the right. After that it occupies one of the segments [*x**i*<=-<=*h**i*,<=*x**i*] or [*x**i*;*x**i*<=+<=*h**i*]. The tree that is not cut down occupies a single point with coordinate *x**i*. Woodcutters can fell a tree if the segment to be occupied by the fallen tree doesn't contain any occupied point. The woodcutters want to process as many trees as possible, so Susie wonders, what is the maximum number of trees to fell.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of trees.\n\nNext *n* lines contain pairs of integers *x**i*,<=*h**i* (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*h**i*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the coordinate and the height of the *\u0456*-th tree.\n\nThe pairs are given in the order of ascending *x**i*.

He decided to eat an equal amount of candies each morning until there are no more candies. However, Petya also noticed the box and decided to get some candies for himself.\n\nThis means the process of eating candies is the following: in the beginning Vasya chooses a single integer $k$, same for all days. After that, in the morning he eats $k$ candies from the box (if there are less than $k$ candies in the box, he eats them all), then in the evening Petya eats $10\\%$ of the candies remaining in the box.

For example, if there were $97$ candies in the box, Petya would eat only $9$ of them. In particular, if there are less than $10$ candies in a box, Petya won't eat any at all.\n\nYour task is to find out the minimal amount of $k$ that can be chosen by Vasya so that he would eat at least half of the $n$ candies he initially got.

Thus the left shell is assigned number 0, the middle shell is 1 and the right shell is 2.

Then both players name the digits written on their cards one by one. If two digits are not equal, then the player, whose digit is smaller gets a flick (knock in the forehead usually made with a forefinger) from the other player. For example, if *n*<==<=3, Sherlock's card is 123 and Moriarty's card has number 321, first Sherlock names 1 and Moriarty names 3 so Sherlock gets a flick.

Finally, Sherlock names 3, while Moriarty names 1 and gets a flick.\n\nOf course, Sherlock will play honestly naming digits one by one in the order they are given, while Moriary, as a true villain, plans to cheat. He is going to name his digits in some other order (however, he is not going to change the overall number of occurences of each digit).

Write a python script for the following problem: A famous sculptor Cicasso goes to a world tour!\n\nWell, it is not actually a world-wide. But not everyone should have the opportunity to see works of sculptor, shouldn't he? Otherwise there will be no any exclusivity. So Cicasso will entirely hold the world tour in his native country \u2014 Berland.\n\nCicasso is very devoted to his work and he wants to be distracted as little as possible. Therefore he will visit only four cities. These cities will be different, so no one could think that he has \"favourites\". Of course, to save money, he will chose the shortest paths between these cities. But as you have probably guessed, Cicasso is a weird person. Although he doesn't like to organize exhibitions, he likes to travel around the country and enjoy its scenery. So he wants the total distance which he will travel to be as large as possible. However, the sculptor is bad in planning, so he asks you for help. \n\nThere are *n* cities and *m* one-way roads in Berland. You have to choose four different cities, which Cicasso will visit and also determine the order in which he will visit them. So that the total distance he will travel, if he visits cities in your order, starting from the first city in your list, and ending in the last, choosing each time the shortest route between a pair of cities \u2014 will be the largest. \n\nNote that intermediate routes may pass through the cities, which are assigned to the tour, as well as pass twice through the same city. For example, the tour can look like that: . Four cities in the order of visiting marked as overlines: [1,<=5,<=2,<=4].\n\nNote that Berland is a high-tech country. So using nanotechnologies all roads were altered so that they have the same length. For the same reason moving using regular cars is not very popular in the country, and it can happen that there are such pairs of cities, one of which generally can not be reached by car from the other one. However, Cicasso is very conservative and cannot travel without the car. Choose cities so that the sculptor can make the tour using only the automobile. It is guaranteed that it is always possible to do.\nInput specification: In the first line there is a pair of integers *n* and *m* (4<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3000,<=3<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=5000) \u2014 a number of cities and one-way roads in Berland.\n\nEach of the next *m* lines contains a pair of integers *u**i*,<=*v**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 a one-way road from the city *u**i* to the city *v**i*. Note that *u**i* and *v**i* are not required to be distinct. Moreover, it can be several one-way roads between the same pair of cities.. Output specification: Print four integers \u2014 numbers of cities which Cicasso will visit according to optimal choice of the route. Numbers of cities should be printed in the order that Cicasso will visit them. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['8 9\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 4\\n4 1\\n4 5\\n5 6\\n6 7\\n7 8\\n8 5\\n'], Demo output: ['2 1 8 7\\n']\nNote: Let *d*(*x*,\u2009*y*) be the shortest distance between cities *x* and *y*.

However, it's not mandatory for the flights to depart in the same order they were initially scheduled to do so\u00a0\u2014 their order in the new schedule can be different. There is only one restriction: no flight is allowed to depart earlier than it was supposed to depart in the initial schedule.\n\nHelen knows that each minute of delay of the *i*-th flight costs airport *c**i* burles.

At that, the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section. That is, for example, the garden can be represented by a 1<=\u00d7<=5 rectangle, where the section heights are equal to 4, 2, 3, 3, 2. Then if we create an artificial rain over any of the sections with the height of 3, the water will flow over all the sections, except the ones with the height of 4. See the illustration of this example at the picture:\n\nAs Petya is keen on programming, he decided to find such a section that if we create artificial rain above it, the number of watered sections will be maximal. Help him.\nInput specification: The first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000). The second line contains *n* positive integers which are the height of the sections. All the numbers are no less than 1 and not more than 1000.. Output specification: Print a single number, the maximal number of watered sections if we create artificial rain above exactly one section.\nDemo input: ['1\\n2\\n', '5\\n1 2 1 2 1\\n', '8\\n1 2 1 1 1 3 3 4\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '3\\n', '6\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Vasya works as a DJ in the best Berland nightclub, and he often uses dubstep music in his performance. Recently, he has decided to take a couple of old songs and make dubstep remixes from them.\n\nLet's assume that a song consists of some number of words. To make the dubstep remix of this song, Vasya inserts a certain number of words \"WUB\" before the first word of the song (the number may be zero), after the last word (the number may be zero), and between words (at least one between any pair of neighbouring words), and then the boy glues together all the words, including \"WUB\", in one string and plays the song at the club.\n\nFor example, a song with words \"I AM X\" can transform into a dubstep remix as \"WUBWUBIWUBAMWUBWUBX\" and cannot transform into \"WUBWUBIAMWUBX\".\n\nRecently, Petya has heard Vasya's new dubstep track, but since he isn't into modern music, he decided to find out what was the initial song that Vasya remixed. Help Petya restore the original song.\nInput specification: The input consists of a single non-empty string, consisting only of uppercase English letters, the string's length doesn't exceed 200 characters. It is guaranteed that before Vasya remixed the song, no word contained substring \"WUB\" in it; Vasya didn't change the word order. It is also guaranteed that initially the song had at least one word.. Output specification: Print the words of the initial song that Vasya used to make a dubsteb remix.

That means that the song originally consisted of a single word \"ABC\", and all words \"WUB\" were added by Vasya.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya added a single word \"WUB\" between all neighbouring words, in the beginning and in the end, except for words \"ARE\" and \"THE\" \u2014 between them Vasya added two \"WUB\"."}]}}

The tunnel is a rectangular field consisting of three rows and *n* columns. At the beginning of the game the hero is in some cell of the leftmost column. Some number of trains rides towards the hero. Each train consists of two or more neighbouring cells in some row of the field.\n\nAll trains are moving from right to left at a speed of two cells per second, and the hero runs from left to right at the speed of one cell per second. For simplicity, the game is implemented so that the hero and the trains move in turns. First, the hero moves one cell to the right, then one square up or down, or stays idle. Then all the trains move twice simultaneously one cell to the left. Thus, in one move, Philip definitely makes a move to the right and can move up or down. If at any point, Philip is in the same cell with a train, he loses. If the train reaches the left column, it continues to move as before, leaving the tunnel.\n\nYour task is to answer the question whether there is a sequence of movements of Philip, such that he would be able to get to the rightmost column.\nInput specification: Each test contains from one to ten sets of the input data.

Write a python script for the following problem: Tyndex is again well ahead of the rivals! The reaction to the release of Zoozle Chrome browser was the release of a new browser Tyndex.Brome!\n\nThe popularity of the new browser is growing daily. And the secret is not even the Tyndex.Bar installed (the Tyndex.Bar automatically fills the glass with the finest 1664 cognac after you buy Tyndex.Bottles and insert in into a USB port). It is highly popular due to the well-thought interaction with the user.\n\nLet us take, for example, the system of automatic address correction. Have you entered codehorses instead of codeforces? The gloomy Zoozle Chrome will sadly say that the address does not exist. Tyndex.Brome at the same time will automatically find the closest address and sent you there. That's brilliant!\n\nHow does this splendid function work? That's simple! For each potential address a function of the *F* error is calculated by the following rules:\n -  for every letter *c**i* from the potential address *c* the closest position *j* of the letter *c**i* in the address (*s*) entered by the user is found. The absolute difference |*i*<=-<=*j*| of these positions is added to *F*. So for every *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=|*c*|) the position *j* is chosen such, that *c**i*<==<=*s**j*, and |*i*<=-<=*j*| is minimal possible. -  if no such letter *c**i* exists in the address entered by the user, then the length of the potential address |*c*| is added to *F*. \nAfter the values of the error function have been calculated for all the potential addresses the most suitable one is found. \n\nTo understand the special features of the above described method better, it is recommended to realize the algorithm of calculating the *F* function for an address given by the user and some set of potential addresses. Good luck!\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105,<=1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=105). They are the number of potential addresses and the length of the address entered by the user. The next line contains *k* lowercase Latin letters. They are the address entered by the user (*s*). Each next *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) line contains a non-empty sequence of lowercase Latin letters. They are the potential address. It is guaranteed that the total length of all the lines does not exceed 2\u00b7105..

Recently, Valya took offense at her boyfriend because he came to her in t-shirt with lettering that differs from lettering on her pullover. Now she doesn't want to see him and Tolya is seating at his room and crying at her photos all day long.\n\nThis story could be very sad but fairy godmother (Tolya's grandmother) decided to help them and restore their relationship.

In order to do this, for one unit of mana she can buy a spell that can change some letters on the clothes. Your task is calculate the minimum amount of mana that Tolya's grandmother should spend to rescue love of Tolya and Valya.\n\nMore formally, letterings on Tolya's t-shirt and Valya's pullover are two strings with same length *n* consisting only of lowercase English letters. Using one unit of mana, grandmother can buy a spell of form (*c*1,<=*c*2) (where *c*1 and *c*2 are some lowercase English letters), which can arbitrary number of times transform a single letter *c*1 to *c*2 and vise-versa on both Tolya's t-shirt and Valya's pullover.

For example, during yesterday sitting the Berland Parliament approved as much as *n* laws (each law has been assigned a unique number from 1 to *n*). Today all these laws were put on the table of the President of Berland, G.W. Boosch, to be signed.\n\nThis time mr. Boosch plans to sign 2*k* laws. He decided to choose exactly two non-intersecting segments of integers from 1 to *n* of length *k* and sign all laws, whose numbers fall into these segments. More formally, mr. Boosch is going to choose two integers *a*, *b* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*k*<=+<=1,<=*b*<=-<=*a*<=\u2265<=*k*) and sign all laws with numbers lying in the segments [*a*;\u00a0*a*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] and [*b*;\u00a0*b*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] (borders are included).\n\nAs mr. Boosch chooses the laws to sign, he of course considers the public opinion. Allberland Public Opinion Study Centre (APOSC) conducted opinion polls among the citizens, processed the results into a report and gave it to the president. The report contains the absurdity value for each law, in the public opinion. As mr. Boosch is a real patriot, he is keen on signing the laws with the maximum total absurdity.

To achieve this goal, Polycarp has spent several hours in front of his laptop and implemented a chat server that can process three types of commands:\n -  Include a person to the chat ('Add' command). -  Remove a person from the chat ('Remove' command). -  Send a message from a person to all people, who are currently in the chat, including the one, who sends the message ('Send' command). \nNow Polycarp wants to find out the amount of outgoing traffic that the server will produce while processing a particular set of commands.\n\nPolycarp knows that chat server sends no traffic for 'Add' and 'Remove' commands. When 'Send' command is processed, server sends *l* bytes to each participant of the chat, where *l* is the length of the message.\n\nAs Polycarp has no time, he is asking for your help in solving this problem.\nInput specification: Input file will contain not more than 100 commands, each in its own line. No line will exceed 100 characters. Formats of the commands will be the following:\n -  +&lt;name&gt; for 'Add' command. -  -&lt;name&gt; for 'Remove' command. -  &lt;sender_name&gt;:&lt;message_text&gt; for 'Send' command. \n&lt;name&gt; and &lt;sender_name&gt; is a non-empty sequence of Latin letters and digits. &lt;message_text&gt; can contain letters, digits and spaces, but can't start or end with a space. &lt;message_text&gt; can be an empty line.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that input data are correct, i.e. there will be no 'Add' command if person with such a name is already in the chat, there will be no 'Remove' command if there is no person with such a name in the chat etc.\n\nAll names are case-sensitive.. Output specification: Print a single number \u2014 answer to the problem.\nDemo input: ['+Mike\\nMike:hello\\n+Kate\\n+Dmitry\\n-Dmitry\\nKate:hi\\n-Kate\\n', '+Mike\\n-Mike\\n+Mike\\nMike:Hi   I am here\\n-Mike\\n+Kate\\n-Kate\\n'], Demo output: ['9\\n', '14\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

The SMSC uses a queue to organize its work. Consider a time moment *x*, the SMSC work at that moment as follows:\n 1.

She also has put a robot at each end of the row (to the left of the first number and to the right of the last number). Sonya will give a number to each robot (they can be either same or different) and run them. When a robot is running, it is moving toward to another robot, reading numbers in the row. When a robot is reading a number that is equal to the number that was given to that robot, it will turn off and stay in the same position.\n\nSonya does not want robots to break, so she will give such numbers that robots will stop before they meet. That is, the girl wants them to stop at different positions so that the first robot is to the left of the second one.\n\nFor example, if the numbers $[1, 5, 4, 1, 3]$ are written, and Sonya gives the number $1$ to the first robot and the number $4$ to the second one, the first robot will stop in the $1$-st position while the second one in the $3$-rd position. In that case, robots will not meet each other. As a result, robots will not be broken. But if Sonya gives the number $4$ to the first robot and the number $5$ to the second one, they will meet since the first robot will stop in the $3$-rd position while the second one is in the $2$-nd position.\n\nSonya understands that it does not make sense to give a number that is not written in the row because a robot will not find this number and will meet the other robot.\n\nSonya is now interested in finding the number of different pairs that she can give to robots so that they will not meet. In other words, she wants to know the number of pairs ($p$, $q$), where she will give $p$ to the first robot and $q$ to the second one. Pairs ($p_i$, $q_i$) and ($p_j$, $q_j$) are different if $p_i\\neq p_j$ or $q_i\\neq q_j$.\n\nUnfortunately, Sonya is busy fixing robots that broke after a failed launch.

Write a python script for the following problem: The ancient Berlanders believed that the longer the name, the more important its bearer is. Thus, Berland kings were famous for their long names. But long names are somewhat inconvenient, so the Berlanders started to abbreviate the names of their kings. They called every king by the first letters of its name. Thus, the king, whose name was Victorious Vasily Pupkin, was always called by the berlanders VVP.\n\nIn Berland over its long history many dynasties of kings replaced each other, but they were all united by common traditions. Thus, according to one Berland traditions, to maintain stability in the country, the first name of the heir should be the same as the last name his predecessor (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the heir coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the predecessor). Berlanders appreciate stability, so this tradition has never been broken. Also Berlanders like perfection, so another tradition requires that the first name of the first king in the dynasty coincides with the last name of the last king in this dynasty (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the first king coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the last king). This tradition, of course, has also been always observed.\n\nThe name of a dynasty is formed by very simple rules: we take all the short names of the kings in the order in which they ruled, and write them in one line. Thus, a dynasty of kings \"ab\" and \"ba\" is called \"abba\", and the dynasty, which had only the king \"abca\", is called \"abca\".\n\nVasya, a historian, has recently found a list of abbreviated names of all Berland kings and their relatives. Help Vasya to find the maximally long name of the dynasty that could have existed in Berland.\n\nNote that in his list all the names are ordered by the time, that is, if name *A* is earlier in the list than *B*, then if *A* and *B* were kings, then king *A* ruled before king *B*.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=5\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of names in Vasya's list.
