This game is similar to the \"Rock-Paper-Scissors\" game: both robots secretly choose a number from the set {1,<=2,<=3} and say it at the same moment. If both robots choose the same number, then it's a draw and noone gets any points. But if chosen numbers are different, then one of the robots gets a point: 3 beats 2, 2 beats 1 and 1 beats 3. \n\nBoth robots' programs make them choose their numbers in such a way that their choice in (*i*<=+<=1)-th game depends only on the numbers chosen by them in *i*-th game. \n\nIlya knows that the robots will play *k* games, Alice will choose number *a* in the first game, and Bob will choose *b* in the first game.

Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up \u2014 who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that\u2019s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player wins.

For example, if a friend moves first to the left, then to the right (returning to the same point), and then again to the left his tiredness becomes equal to 1<=+<=2<=+<=3<==<=6.\n\nThe friends want to meet in a integer point. Determine the minimum total tiredness they should gain, if they meet in the same point.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *a* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the initial position of the first friend. \n\nThe second line contains a single integer *b* (1<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the initial position of the second friend.\n\nIt is guaranteed that *a*<=\u2260<=*b*.. Output specification: Print the minimum possible total tiredness if the friends meet in the same point.\nDemo input: ['3\\n4\\n', '101\\n99\\n', '5\\n10\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '2\\n', '9\\n']\nNote: In the first example the first friend should move by one to the right (then the meeting happens at point 4), or the second friend should move by one to the left (then the meeting happens at point 3). In both cases, the total tiredness becomes 1.\n\nIn the second example the first friend should move by one to the left, and the second friend should move by one to the right. Then they meet in the point 100, and the total tiredness becomes 1\u2009+\u20091\u2009=\u20092.\n\nIn the third example one of the optimal ways is the following. The first friend should move three times to the right, and the second friend \u2014 two times to the left. Thus the friends meet in the point 8, and the total tiredness becomes 1\u2009+\u20092\u2009+\u20093\u2009+\u20091\u2009+\u20092\u2009=\u20099."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: \n -  alloc n \u2014 to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; \nThe memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.\n\nThe first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.\nInput specification: The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100;1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *t* \u2014 the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* \u2014 the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.. Output specification: Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession. Output lines should go in the same order in which the operations are processed. Successful procession of alloc operation should return integers, starting with 1, as the identifiers of the allocated blocks.\nDemo input: ['6 10\\nalloc 5\\nalloc 3\\nerase 1\\nalloc 6\\ndefragment\\nalloc 6\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n2\\nNULL\\n3\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Many people will surely be willing to visit this splendid shrine of high culture.\n\nIn Mainframe a standard pack of 52 cards is used to play blackjack. The pack contains cards of 13 values: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jacks, queens, kings and aces. Each value also exists in one of four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. Also, each card earns some value in points assigned to it: cards with value from two to ten earn from 2 to 10 points, correspondingly. An ace can either earn 1 or 11, whatever the player wishes. The picture cards (king, queen and jack) earn 10 points. The number of points a card earns does not depend on the suit. The rules of the game are very simple. The player gets two cards, if the sum of points of those cards equals *n*, then the player wins, otherwise the player loses.\n\nThe player has already got the first card, it's the queen of spades.

Write a python script for the following problem: Leha is planning his journey from Moscow to Saratov. He hates trains, so he has decided to get from one city to another by car.\n\nThe path from Moscow to Saratov can be represented as a straight line (well, it's not that straight in reality, but in this problem we will consider it to be straight), and the distance between Moscow and Saratov is $n$ km. Let's say that Moscow is situated at the point with coordinate $0$ km, and Saratov \u2014 at coordinate $n$ km.\n\nDriving for a long time may be really difficult. Formally, if Leha has already covered $i$ kilometers since he stopped to have a rest, he considers the difficulty of covering $(i + 1)$-th kilometer as $a_{i + 1}$. It is guaranteed that for every $i \\in [1, n - 1]$ $a_i \\le a_{i + 1}$. The difficulty of the journey is denoted as the sum of difficulties of each kilometer in the journey.\n\nFortunately, there may be some rest sites between Moscow and Saratov. Every integer point from $1$ to $n - 1$ may contain a rest site. When Leha enters a rest site, he may have a rest, and the next kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the kilometer after it \u2014 difficulty $a_2$, and so on.\n\nFor example, if $n = 5$ and there is a rest site in coordinate $2$, the difficulty of journey will be $2a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3$: the first kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the second one \u2014 $a_2$, then Leha will have a rest, and the third kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the fourth \u2014 $a_2$, and the last one \u2014 $a_3$. Another example: if $n = 7$ and there are rest sites in coordinates $1$ and $5$, the difficulty of Leha's journey is $3a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3 + a_4$.\n\nLeha doesn't know which integer points contain rest sites. So he has to consider every possible situation. Obviously, there are $2^{n - 1}$ different distributions of rest sites (two distributions are different if there exists some point $x$ such that it contains a rest site in exactly one of these distributions). Leha considers all these distributions to be equiprobable. He wants to calculate $p$ \u2014 the expected value of difficulty of his journey.\n\nObviously, $p \\cdot 2^{n - 1}$ is an integer number. You have to calculate it modulo $998244353$.\nInput specification: The first line contains one number $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^6$) \u2014 the distance from Moscow to Saratov.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integer numbers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($1 \\le a_1 \\le a_2 \\le \\dots \\le a_n \\le 10^6$), where $a_i$ is the difficulty of $i$-th kilometer after Leha has rested.. Output specification: Print one number \u2014 $p \\cdot 2^{n - 1}$, taken modulo $998244353$.\nDemo input: ['2\\n1 2\\n', '4\\n1 3 3 7\\n'], Demo output: ['5\\n', '60\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.\n\nCodeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is *x*, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute *m* but made *w* wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is .

Consequently, all identical solutions have the same *x*.\n\nIt is known that the data in the testing system are stored in the chronological order, that is, if the testing system has a solution with number *x* (*x*<=&gt;<=0) of the participant with number *k*, then the testing system has a solution with number *x*<=-<=1 of the same participant stored somewhere before.\n\nDuring the competition the checking system crashed, but then the data of the submissions of all participants have been restored. Now the jury wants to verify that the recovered data is in chronological order. Help the jury to do so.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of solutions.

This table (it is also referred to as grid) contains some encrypted word that needs to be decoded.\n\nTo solve the crossword you should cross out all repeated letters in rows and columns.

Write a python script for the following problem: After the big birthday party, Katie still wanted Shiro to have some more fun. Later, she came up with a game called treasure hunt. Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\n\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.. Output specification: Print the name of the winner (\"Kuro\", \"Shiro\" or \"Katie\"). If there are at least two cats that share the maximum beauty, print \"Draw\".\nDemo input: ['3\\nKuroo\\nShiro\\nKatie\\n', '7\\ntreasurehunt\\nthreefriends\\nhiCodeforces\\n', '1\\nabcabc\\ncbabac\\nababca\\n', '15\\nfoPaErcvJ\\nmZaxowpbt\\nmkuOlaHRE\\n'], Demo output: ['Kuro\\n', 'Shiro\\n', 'Katie\\n', 'Draw\\n']\nNote: In the first example, after $3$ turns, Kuro can change his ribbon into ooooo, which has the beauty of $5$, while reaching such beauty for Shiro and Katie is impossible (both Shiro and Katie can reach the beauty of at most $4$, for example by changing Shiro's ribbon into SSiSS and changing Katie's ribbon into Kaaaa). Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice. Therefore, the game ends in a draw."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Noora is a student of one famous high school. It's her final year in school\u00a0\u2014 she is going to study in university next year. However, she has to get an \u00abA\u00bb graduation certificate in order to apply to a prestigious one.\n\nIn school, where Noora is studying, teachers are putting down marks to the online class register, which are integers from 1 to *k*. The worst mark is 1, the best is *k*. Mark that is going to the certificate, is calculated as an average of all the marks, rounded to the closest integer. If several answers are possible, rounding up is produced. For example, 7.3 is rounded to 7, but 7.5 and 7.8784\u00a0\u2014 to 8. \n\nFor instance, if Noora has marks [8,<=9], then the mark to the certificate is 9, because the average is equal to 8.5 and rounded to 9, but if the marks are [8,<=8,<=9], Noora will have graduation certificate with 8.\n\nTo graduate with \u00abA\u00bb certificate, Noora has to have mark *k*.\n\nNoora got *n* marks in register this year. However, she is afraid that her marks are not enough to get final mark *k*. Noora decided to ask for help in the internet, where hacker Leha immediately responded to her request. He is ready to hack class register for Noora and to add Noora any number of additional marks from 1 to *k*. At the same time, Leha want his hack be unseen to everyone, so he decided to add as less as possible additional marks. Please help Leha to calculate the minimal number of marks he has to add, so that final Noora's mark will become equal to *k*.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100,<=1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=100) denoting the number of marks, received by Noora and the value of highest possible mark.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*k*) denoting marks received by Noora before Leha's hack.. Output specification: Print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 minimal number of additional marks, that Leha has to add in order to change Noora's final mark to *k*.\nDemo input: ['2 10\\n8 9\\n', '3 5\\n4 4 4\\n'], Demo output: ['4', '3']\nNote: Consider the first example testcase.\n\nMaximal mark is 10, Noora received two marks\u00a0\u2014 8 and 9, so current final mark is 9. To fix it, Leha can add marks [10,\u200910,\u200910,\u200910] (4 marks in total) to the registry, achieving Noora having average mark equal to <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/1b961585522f76271546da990a6228e7c666277f.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>. Consequently, new final mark is 10. Less number of marks won't fix the situation.\n\nIn the second example Leha can add [5,\u20095,\u20095] to the registry, so that making average mark equal to 4.5, which is enough to have 5 in the certificate."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Shapur was an extremely gifted student. He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.\n\nOne day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.\nInput specification: There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number. It is guaranteed that the numbers are made from 0 and 1 only and that their length is same. The numbers may start with 0. The length of each number doesn't exceed 100.. Output specification: Write one line \u2014 the corresponding answer. Do not omit the leading 0s.\nDemo input: ['1010100\\n0100101\\n', '000\\n111\\n', '1110\\n1010\\n', '01110\\n01100\\n'], Demo output: ['1110001\\n', '111\\n', '0100\\n', '00010\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

He descends into the subway at some time, waits the first train to come and rides on it to the end of the branch to the corresponding girl. However, the trains run with different frequencies: a train goes to Dasha's direction every *a* minutes, but a train goes to Masha's direction every *b* minutes.

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently a top secret mission to Mars has taken place. As a result, scientists managed to obtain some information about the Martian DNA. Now we know that any Martian DNA contains at most *m* different nucleotides, numbered from 1 to *m*. Special characteristics of the Martian DNA prevent some nucleotide pairs from following consecutively in this chain. For example, if the nucleotide 1 and nucleotide 2 can not follow consecutively in the Martian DNA, then the chain of nucleotides [1, 2] is not a valid chain of Martian DNA, but the chain of nucleotides [2, 1] can be a valid chain (if there is no corresponding restriction). The number of nucleotide pairs that can't follow in the DNA chain consecutively, is *k*. \n\nThe needs of gene research required information about the quantity of correct *n*-long chains of the Martian DNA. Your task is to write a program that will calculate this value.\nInput specification: The first line contains three space-separated integers *n*,<=*m*,<=*k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1015, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=52, 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*m*2).\n\nNext *k* lines contain two characters each, without a space between them, representing a forbidden nucleotide pair. The first character represents the first nucleotide in the forbidden pair, the second character represents the second nucleotide.\n\nThe nucleotides with assigned numbers from 1 to 26 are represented by English alphabet letters from \"a\" to \"z\" (1 is an \"a\", 2 is a \"b\", ..., 26 is a \"z\").

He also told his dad that the wooden piece is a strictly convex polygon with $n$ vertices.\n\nHag brought two pins and pinned the polygon with them in the $1$-st and $2$-nd vertices to the wall. His dad has $q$ queries to Hag of two types. \n -  $1$ $f$ $t$: pull a pin from the vertex $f$, wait for the wooden polygon to rotate under the gravity force (if it will rotate) and stabilize. And then put the pin in vertex $t$. -  $2$ $v$: answer what are the coordinates of the vertex $v$. \nPlease help Hag to answer his father's queries.\n\nYou can assume that the wood that forms the polygon has uniform density and the polygon has a positive thickness, same in all points.

By all other words you should build string *b* in the same way (the order of numbers should remain the same as in the string *s*).\n\nHere strings \"101\", \"0\" are INTEGER numbers, but \"01\" and \"1.0\" are not.\n\nFor example, for the string aba,123;1a;0 the string *a* would be equal to \"123,0\" and string *b* would be equal to \"aba,1a\".\nInput specification: The only line of input contains the string *s* (1<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=105). The string contains only symbols '.' (ASCII 46), ',' (ASCII 44), ';' (ASCII 59), digits, lowercase and uppercase latin letters.. Output specification: Print the string *a* to the first line and string *b* to the second line. Each string should be surrounded by quotes (ASCII 34).\n\nIf there are no words that are numbers print dash (ASCII 45) on the first line. If all words are numbers print dash on the second line.\nDemo input: ['aba,123;1a;0\\n', '1;;01,a0,\\n', '1\\n', 'a\\n'], Demo output: ['\"123,0\"\\n\"aba,1a\"\\n', '\"1\"\\n\",01,a0,\"\\n', '\"1\"\\n-\\n', '-\\n\"a\"\\n']\nNote: In the second example the string *s* contains five words: \"1\", \"\", \"01\", \"a0\", \"\"."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: By 2312 there were *n* Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*).. Output specification: Print *m* lines \u2014 the results of executing requests in the above given format. The requests should be processed in the order, in which they are given in the input.

Many people will surely be willing to visit this splendid shrine of high culture.\n\nIn Mainframe a standard pack of 52 cards is used to play blackjack. The pack contains cards of 13 values: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jacks, queens, kings and aces. Each value also exists in one of four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. Also, each card earns some value in points assigned to it: cards with value from two to ten earn from 2 to 10 points, correspondingly. An ace can either earn 1 or 11, whatever the player wishes. The picture cards (king, queen and jack) earn 10 points. The number of points a card earns does not depend on the suit. The rules of the game are very simple. The player gets two cards, if the sum of points of those cards equals *n*, then the player wins, otherwise the player loses.\n\nThe player has already got the first card, it's the queen of spades.

Radewoosh will get 0 points for other two problems but he is the winner anyway.\n\nIn the third sample, Limak will get 2 points for the 1-st problem and 2 points for the 2-nd problem.

Write a python script for the following problem: Little Petya often travels to his grandmother in the countryside. The grandmother has a large garden, which can be represented as a rectangle 1<=\u00d7<=*n* in size, when viewed from above. This rectangle is divided into *n* equal square sections. The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.\n\nCreating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section. At that, the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section. That is, for example, the garden can be represented by a 1<=\u00d7<=5 rectangle, where the section heights are equal to 4, 2, 3, 3, 2. Then if we create an artificial rain over any of the sections with the height of 3, the water will flow over all the sections, except the ones with the height of 4.

It is a typical well-known definition of a connected component.\n\nFor each impassable cell (*x*,<=*y*) imagine that it is an empty cell (all other cells remain unchanged) and find the size (the number of cells) of the connected component which contains (*x*,<=*y*). You should do it for each impassable cell independently.\n\nThe answer should be printed as a matrix with *n* rows and *m* columns. The *j*-th symbol of the *i*-th row should be \".\" if the cell is empty at the start. Otherwise the *j*-th symbol of the *i*-th row should contain the only digit \u2014- the answer modulo 10. The matrix should be printed without any spaces.\n\nTo make your output faster it is recommended to build the output as an array of *n* strings having length *m* and print it as a sequence of lines. It will be much faster than writing character-by-character.\n\nAs input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n*,<=*m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the number of rows and columns in the field.\n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains *m* symbols: \".\" for empty cells, \"*\" for impassable cells.. Output specification: Print the answer as a matrix as described above. See the examples to precise the format of the output.\nDemo input: ['3 3\\n*.*\\n.*.\\n*.*\\n', '4 5\\n**..*\\n..***\\n.*.*.\\n*.*.*\\n'], Demo output: ['3.3\\n.5.\\n3.3\\n', '46..3\\n..732\\n.6.4.\\n5.4.3\\n']\nNote: In first example, if we imagine that the central cell is empty then it will be included to component of size 5 (cross). If any of the corner cell will be empty then it will be included to component of size 3 (corner)."}]}}

No two friends have the same value *t**i*.\n\nSpring is starting and the Winter sleep is over for bears. Limak has just woken up and logged in.

He isn't sure how many candies he will save in the 2016 with his plan. Please, calculate it and tell him.\nInput specification: The only line of the input is in one of the following two formats: \n -  \"*x* of week\" where *x* (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=7) denotes the day of the week. The 1-st day is Monday and the 7-th one is Sunday. -  \"*x* of month\" where *x* (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=31) denotes the day of the month.. Output specification: Print one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of candies Limak will save in the year 2016.\nDemo input: ['4 of week\\n', '30 of month\\n'], Demo output: ['52\\n', '11\\n']\nNote: Polar bears use the Gregorian calendar. It is the most common calendar and you likely use it too. You can read about it on Wikipedia if you want to \u2013 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar). The week starts with Monday.\n\nIn the first sample Limak wants to save one candy on each Thursday (the 4-th day of the week). There are 52 Thursdays in the 2016. Thus, he will save 52 candies in total.\n\nIn the second sample Limak wants to save one candy on the 30-th day of each month. There is the 30-th day in exactly 11 months in the 2016\u00a0\u2014 all months but February. It means that Limak will save 11 candies in total."}]}}

And, as the boy loves hockey very much, even more than physics, he forgot to do the homework. Specifically, he forgot to complete his physics tasks. Next day the teacher got very angry at Vasya and decided to teach him a lesson. He gave the lazy student a seemingly easy task: You are given an idle body in space and the forces that affect it. The body can be considered as a material point with coordinates (0; 0; 0). Vasya had only to answer whether it is in equilibrium. \"Piece of cake\" \u2014 thought Vasya, we need only to check if the sum of all vectors is equal to 0. So, Vasya began to solve the problem.

As the minutes from the 1-st to the 4-th one don't contain interesting moments, we press the second button. Now we can not press the second button and skip 3 more minutes, because some of them contain interesting moments. Therefore, we watch the movie from the 4-th to the 6-th minute, after that the current time is 7. Similarly, we again skip 3 minutes and then watch from the 10-th to the 12-th minute of the movie. In total, we watch 6 minutes of the movie.\n\nIn the second sample, the movie is very interesting, so you'll have to watch all 100000 minutes of the movie."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Each year in the castle of Dwarven King there is a competition in growing mushrooms among the dwarves. The competition is one of the most prestigious ones, and the winner gets a wooden salad bowl. This year's event brought together the best mushroom growers from around the world, so we had to slightly change the rules so that the event gets more interesting to watch.\n\nEach mushroom grower has a mushroom that he will grow on the competition. Under the new rules, the competition consists of two parts. The first part lasts *t*1 seconds and the second part lasts *t*2 seconds. The first and the second part are separated by a little break.\n\nAfter the starting whistle the first part of the contest starts, and all mushroom growers start growing mushrooms at once, each at his individual speed of *v**i* meters per second. After *t*1 seconds, the mushroom growers stop growing mushrooms and go to have a break. During the break, for unexplained reasons, the growth of all mushrooms is reduced by *k* percent. After the break the second part of the contest starts and all mushrooms growers at the same time continue to grow mushrooms, each at his individual speed of *u**i* meters per second. After a *t*2 seconds after the end of the break, the competition ends. Note that the speeds before and after the break may vary.\n\nBefore the match dwarf Pasha learned from all participants, what two speeds they have chosen. However, the participants did not want to disclose to him all their strategy and therefore, did not say in what order they will be using these speeds. That is, if a participant chose speeds *a**i* and *b**i*, then there are two strategies: he either uses speed *a**i* before the break and speed *b**i* after it, or vice versa.\n\nDwarf Pasha really wants to win the totalizer. He knows that each participant chooses the strategy that maximizes the height of the mushroom. Help Dwarf Pasha make the final table of competition results.\n\nThe participants are sorted in the result table by the mushroom height (the participants with higher mushrooms follow earlier in the table). In case of equal mushroom heights, the participants are sorted by their numbers (the participants with a smaller number follow earlier).\nInput specification: The first input line contains four integer numbers *n*, *t*1, *t*2, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*t*1,<=*t*2<=\u2264<=1000;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of participants, the time before the break, the time after the break and the percentage, by which the mushroom growth drops during the break, correspondingly.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains two integers.

For example, during yesterday sitting the Berland Parliament approved as much as *n* laws (each law has been assigned a unique number from 1 to *n*). Today all these laws were put on the table of the President of Berland, G.W. Boosch, to be signed.\n\nThis time mr. Boosch plans to sign 2*k* laws. He decided to choose exactly two non-intersecting segments of integers from 1 to *n* of length *k* and sign all laws, whose numbers fall into these segments. More formally, mr. Boosch is going to choose two integers *a*, *b* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*k*<=+<=1,<=*b*<=-<=*a*<=\u2265<=*k*) and sign all laws with numbers lying in the segments [*a*;\u00a0*a*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] and [*b*;\u00a0*b*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] (borders are included).\n\nAs mr. Boosch chooses the laws to sign, he of course considers the public opinion. Allberland Public Opinion Study Centre (APOSC) conducted opinion polls among the citizens, processed the results into a report and gave it to the president. The report contains the absurdity value for each law, in the public opinion. As mr. Boosch is a real patriot, he is keen on signing the laws with the maximum total absurdity. Help him.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105, 0<=&lt;<=2*k*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of laws accepted by the parliament and the length of one segment in the law list, correspondingly.

Output specification: Print two integers *a*, *b* \u2014 the beginning of segments that mr. Boosch should choose. That means that the president signs laws with numbers from segments [*a*;\u00a0*a*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] and [*b*;\u00a0*b*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1]. If there are multiple solutions, print the one with the minimum number *a*.

The education is not easy because you need to have fundamental knowledge in different areas, which sometimes are not related to each other. \n\nFor example, you should know linguistics very well. You learn a structure of Reberland language as foreign language. In this language words are constructed according to the following rules. First you need to choose the \"root\" of the word \u2014 some string which has more than 4 letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3 symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction \u2014  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row. All these strings are considered to be suffixes of the word (this time we use word \"suffix\" to describe a morpheme but not the few last characters of the string as you may used to). \n\nHere is one exercise that you have found in your task list. You are given the word *s*. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language. \n\nTwo strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match. \n\nLet's look at the example: the word *abacabaca* is given. This word can be obtained in the following ways: , where the root of the word is overlined, and suffixes are marked by \"corners\". Thus, the set of possible suffixes for this word is {*aca*,<=*ba*,<=*ca*}.\nInput specification: The only line contains a string *s* (5<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=104) consisting of lowercase English letters..

The length of the root equals 5, so no string can be used as a suffix."}]}}

See if you are faster and more accurate.\nInput specification: There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number. It is guaranteed that the numbers are made from 0 and 1 only and that their length is same. The numbers may start with 0. The length of each number doesn't exceed 100..

Each of the stages is defined by a lowercase Latin letter. This way, the rocket can be described by the string\u00a0\u2014 concatenation of letters, which correspond to the stages.\n\nThere are $n$ stages available. The rocket must contain exactly $k$ of them. Stages in the rocket should be ordered by their weight. So, after the stage with some letter can go only stage with a letter, which is at least two positions after in the alphabet (skipping one letter in between, or even more). For example, after letter 'c' can't go letters 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd', but can go letters 'e', 'f', ..., 'z'.\n\nFor the rocket to fly as far as possible, its weight should be minimal. The weight of the rocket is equal to the sum of the weights of its stages. The weight of the stage is the number of its letter in the alphabet. For example, the stage 'a 'weighs one ton,' b 'weighs two tons, and' z'\u00a0\u2014 $26$ tons.\n\nBuild the rocket with the minimal weight or determine, that it is impossible to build a rocket at all.

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently an official statement of the world Olympic Committee said that the Olympic Winter Games 2030 will be held in Tomsk. The city officials decided to prepare for the Olympics thoroughly and to build all the necessary Olympic facilities as early as possible. First, a biathlon track will be built.\n\nTo construct a biathlon track a plot of land was allocated, which is a rectangle divided into *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* identical squares. Each of the squares has two coordinates: the number of the row (from 1 to *n*), where it is located, the number of the column (from 1 to *m*), where it is located. Also each of the squares is characterized by its height. During the sports the biathletes will have to move from one square to another. If a biathlete moves from a higher square to a lower one, he makes a descent. If a biathlete moves from a lower square to a higher one, he makes an ascent. If a biathlete moves between two squares with the same height, then he moves on flat ground.\n\nThe biathlon track should be a border of some rectangular area of the allocated land on which biathletes will move in the clockwise direction. It is known that on one move on flat ground an average biathlete spends *t**p* seconds, an ascent takes *t**u* seconds, a descent takes *t**d* seconds. The Tomsk Administration wants to choose the route so that the average biathlete passes it in as close to *t* seconds as possible. In other words, the difference between time *t**s* of passing the selected track and *t* should be minimum.\n\nFor a better understanding you can look at the first sample of the input data. In this sample *n*<==<=6,<=*m*<==<=7, and the administration wants the track covering time to be as close to *t*<==<=48 seconds as possible, also, *t**p*<==<=3, *t**u*<==<=6 and *t**d*<==<=2. If we consider the rectangle shown on the image by arrows, the average biathlete can move along the boundary in a clockwise direction in exactly 48 seconds. The upper left corner of this track is located in the square with the row number 4, column number 3 and the lower right corner is at square with row number 6, column number 7.\n\nAmong other things the administration wants all sides of the rectangle which boundaries will be the biathlon track to consist of no less than three squares and to be completely contained within the selected land.\n\nYou are given the description of the given plot of land and all necessary time values. You are to write the program to find the most suitable rectangle for a biathlon track. If there are several such rectangles, you are allowed to print any of them.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains three integers *n*, *m* and *t* (3<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=300, 1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the sizes of the land plot and the desired distance covering time.\n\nThe second line also contains three integers *t**p*, *t**u* and *t**d* (1<=\u2264<=*t**p*,<=*t**u*,<=*t**d*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the time the average biathlete needs to cover a flat piece of the track, an ascent and a descent respectively.\n\nThen *n* lines follow, each line contains *m* integers that set the heights of each square of the given plot of land. Each of the height values is a positive integer, not exceeding 106.. Output specification: In a single line of the output print four positive integers \u2014 the number of the row and the number of the column of the upper left corner and the number of the row and the number of the column of the lower right corner of the rectangle that is chosen for the track.\nDemo input: ['6 7 48\\n3 6 2\\n5 4 8 3 3 7 9\\n4 1 6 8 7 1 1\\n1 6 4 6 4 8 6\\n7 2 6 1 6 9 4\\n1 9 8 6 3 9 2\\n4 5 6 8 4 3 7'], Demo output: ['4 3 6 7\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Bob is a farmer. He has a large pasture with many sheep. Recently, he has lost some of them due to wolf attacks. He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of dogs.\nDemo input: ['6 6\\n..S...\\n..S.W.\\n.S....\\n..W...\\n...W..\\n......\\n', '1 2\\nSW\\n', '5 5\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS....\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n..SD..\\n..SDW.\\n.SD...\\n.DW...\\nDD.W..\\n......\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS.D..\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n']\nNote: In the first example, we can split the pasture into two halves, one containing wolves and one containing sheep. Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

There are *m* cities being attacked by humans. So Ari... we meant Super M have to immediately go to each of the cities being attacked to scare those bad humans. Super M can pass from one city to another only using the given roads. Moreover, passing through one road takes her exactly one kron - the time unit used in Byteforces. \n\nHowever, Super M is not on Byteforces now - she is attending a training camp located in a nearby country Codeforces. Fortunately, there is a special device in Codeforces that allows her to instantly teleport from Codeforces to any city of Byteforces.

Write a python script for the following problem: Natasha is going to fly to Mars. She needs to build a rocket, which consists of several stages in some order. Each of the stages is defined by a lowercase Latin letter. This way, the rocket can be described by the string\u00a0\u2014 concatenation of letters, which correspond to the stages.\n\nThere are $n$ stages available. The rocket must contain exactly $k$ of them. Stages in the rocket should be ordered by their weight. So, after the stage with some letter can go only stage with a letter, which is at least two positions after in the alphabet (skipping one letter in between, or even more). For example, after letter 'c' can't go letters 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd', but can go letters 'e', 'f', ..., 'z'.\n\nFor the rocket to fly as far as possible, its weight should be minimal. The weight of the rocket is equal to the sum of the weights of its stages. The weight of the stage is the number of its letter in the alphabet. For example, the stage 'a 'weighs one ton,' b 'weighs two tons, and' z'\u00a0\u2014 $26$ tons.\n\nBuild the rocket with the minimal weight or determine, that it is impossible to build a rocket at all. Each stage can be used at most once.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains two integers\u00a0\u2014 $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n \\le 50$)\u00a0\u2013 the number of available stages and the number of stages to use in the rocket.\n\nThe second line contains string $s$, which consists of exactly $n$ lowercase Latin letters. Each letter defines a new stage, which can be used to build the rocket. Each stage can be used at most once.. Output specification: Print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimal total weight of the rocket or -1, if it is impossible to build the rocket at all.\nDemo input: ['5 3\\nxyabd\\n', '7 4\\nproblem\\n', '2 2\\nab\\n', '12 1\\nabaabbaaabbb\\n'], Demo output: ['29', '34', '-1', '1']\nNote: In the first example, the following rockets satisfy the condition:\n-  \"adx\" (weight is $1+4+24=29$);-  \"ady\" (weight is $1+4+25=30$);-  \"bdx\" (weight is $2+4+24=30$);-  \"bdy\" (weight is $2+4+25=31$).\nRocket \"adx\" has the minimal weight, so the answer is $29$.\n\nIn the second example, target rocket is \"belo\". Its weight is $2+5+12+15=34$.\n\nIn the third example, $n=k=2$, so the rocket must have both stages: 'a' and 'b'.

You can find the description of xor operation in notes.\n\nNote that some permutations can remain indistinguishable from the hidden one, even if you make all possible *n*2 queries.

Write a python script for the following problem: Imagine that you have a twin brother or sister. Having another person that looks exactly like you seems very unusual. It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.\n\nNow let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins. The second line contains a sequence of *n* integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the coins' values. All numbers are separated with spaces.. Output specification: In the single line print the single number \u2014 the minimum needed number of coins.\nDemo input: ['2\\n3 3\\n', '3\\n2 1 2\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: In the first sample you will have to take 2 coins (you and your twin have sums equal to 6,\u20090 correspondingly). If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too. You can pick coins with values 1,\u20092 or 2,\u20092. In any case, the minimum number of coins equals 2."}]}}

A haiku masterpiece contains a description of a moment in those three phrases. Every word is important in a small poem, which is why haiku are rich with symbols. Each word has a special meaning, a special role. The main principle of haiku is to say much using a few words.\n\nTo simplify the matter, in the given problem we will consider that the number of syllable in the phrase is equal to the number of vowel letters there. Only the following letters are regarded as vowel letters: \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\" and \"u\".\n\nThree phases from a certain poem are given. Determine whether it is haiku or not.\nInput specification: The input data consists of three lines. The length of each line is between 1 and 100, inclusive. The *i*-th line contains the *i*-th phrase of the poem. Each phrase consists of one or more words, which are separated by one or more spaces. A word is a non-empty sequence of lowercase Latin letters. Leading and/or trailing spaces in phrases are allowed. Every phrase has at least one non-space character. See the example for clarification.. Output specification: Print \"YES\" (without the quotes) if the poem is a haiku. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (also without the quotes).\nDemo input: ['on  codeforces \\nbeta round is running\\n   a rustling of keys \\n', 'how many gallons\\nof edo s rain did you drink\\n                                cuckoo\\n'], Demo output: ['YES', 'NO']\nNote: none"}]}}

Specifically, the first jigsaw puzzle consists of *f*1 pieces, the second one consists of *f*2 pieces and so on.\n\nMs. Manana doesn't want to upset the children, so she decided that the difference between the numbers of pieces in her presents must be as small as possible. Let *A* be the number of pieces in the largest puzzle that the teacher buys and *B* be the number of pieces in the smallest such puzzle. She wants to choose such *n* puzzles that *A*<=-<=*B* is minimum possible.

The class has 4 students. The shop sells 6 puzzles. If Ms. Manana buys the first four puzzles consisting of 10, 12, 10 and 7 pieces correspondingly, then the difference between the sizes of the largest and the smallest puzzle will be equal to 5. It is impossible to obtain a smaller difference. Note that the teacher can also buy puzzles 1, 3, 4 and 5 to obtain the difference 5."}]}}

So the sequence of numbers written on the cubes in the order from the left to the right equals to *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*.\n\nWhile Vasya was walking, his little brother Stepan played with Vasya's cubes and changed their order, so now the sequence of numbers written on the cubes became equal to *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**n*. \n\nStepan said that he swapped only cubes which where on the positions between *l* and *r*, inclusive, and did not remove or add any other cubes (i. e. he said that he reordered cubes between positions *l* and *r*, inclusive, in some way).\n\nYour task is to determine if it is possible that Stepan said the truth, or it is guaranteed that Stepan deceived his brother.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *l*, *r* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=*r*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of Vasya's cubes and the positions told by Stepan.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the sequence of integers written on cubes in the Vasya's order.\n\nThe third line contains the sequence *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**n* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the sequence of integers written on cubes after Stepan rearranged their order.\n\nIt is guaranteed that Stepan did not remove or add other cubes, he only rearranged Vasya's cubes.. Output specification: Print \"LIE\" (without quotes) if it is guaranteed that Stepan deceived his brother. In the other case, print \"TRUTH\" (without quotes).\nDemo input: ['5 2 4\\n3 4 2 3 1\\n3 2 3 4 1\\n', '3 1 2\\n1 2 3\\n3 1 2\\n', '4 2 4\\n1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1\\n'], Demo output: ['TRUTH\\n', 'LIE\\n', 'TRUTH\\n']\nNote: In the first example there is a situation when Stepan said the truth. Initially the sequence of integers on the cubes was equal to [3, 4, 2, 3, 1]. Stepan could at first swap cubes on positions 2 and 3 (after that the sequence of integers on cubes became equal to [3, 2, 4, 3, 1]), and then swap cubes in positions 3 and 4 (after that the sequence of integers on cubes became equal to [3, 2, 3, 4, 1]).\n\nIn the second example it is not possible that Stepan said truth because he said that he swapped cubes only between positions 1 and 2, but we can see that it is guaranteed that he changed the position of the cube which was on the position 3 at first. So it is guaranteed that Stepan deceived his brother.\n\nIn the third example for any values *l* and *r* there is a situation when Stepan said the truth."}]}}

Jon agrees to Sam's proposal and Sam sets off his journey to the Citadel. However becoming a trainee at the Citadel is not a cakewalk and hence the maesters at the Citadel gave Sam a problem to test his eligibility. \n\nInitially Sam has a list with a single element *n*. Then he has to perform certain operations on this list. In each operation Sam must remove any element *x*, such that *x*<=&gt;<=1, from the list and insert at the same position , ,  sequentially. He must continue with these operations until all the elements in the list are either 0 or 1.\n\nNow the masters want the total number of 1s in the range *l* to *r* (1-indexed).

For example, the strings \"kek\", \"abacaba\", \"r\" and \"papicipap\" are palindromes, while the strings \"abb\" and \"iq\" are not.\n\nA substring $s[l \\ldots r]$ ($1<=\\leq<=l<=\\leq<=r<=\\leq<=|s|$) of a string $s<==<=s_{1}s_{2} \\ldots s_{|s|}$ is the string $s_{l}s_{l<=+<=1} \\ldots s_{r}$.\n\nAnna does not like palindromes, so she makes her friends call her Ann.

One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.\n\nBeroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.\n\nFor example:\n -  the following words have typos: \"hellno\", \"hackcerrs\" and \"backtothefutttture\"; -  the following words don't have typos: \"helllllooooo\", \"tobeornottobe\" and \"oooooo\". \nWhen Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.\n\nImplement this feature of Beroffice editor.

She has never seen this problem before, but, being an experienced participant, she guessed that she should match trees to some sequences and then compare these sequences instead of trees. Sasha wants to match each tree with a sequence *a*0,<=*a*1,<=...,<=*a**h*, where *h* is the height of the tree, and *a**i* equals to the number of vertices that are at distance of *i* edges from root. \n\nUnfortunately, this time Sasha's intuition was wrong, and there could be several trees matching the same sequence. To show it, you need to write a program that, given the sequence *a**i*, builds two non-isomorphic rooted trees that match that sequence, or determines that there is only one such tree.\n\nTwo rooted trees are isomorphic, if you can reenumerate the vertices of the first one in such a way, that the index of the root becomes equal the index of the root of the second tree, and these two trees become equal.\n\nThe height of a rooted tree is the maximum number of edges on a path from the root to any other vertex.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *h* (2<=\u2264<=*h*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the height of the tree.\n\nThe second line contains *h*<=+<=1 integers\u00a0\u2014 the sequence *a*0,<=*a*1,<=...,<=*a**h* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105).

Besides, the keys are of two types. Some of the keys have lowercase Latin letters on them and some of the keys work like the \"Shift\" key on standard keyboards, that is, they make lowercase letters uppercase.\n\nVasya can press one or two keys with one hand. However, he can only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the keys does not exceed *x*. The keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.\n\nVasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest \"Shift\" key is strictly larger than *x*. In this case he will have to use his other hand. Having typed the symbol, Vasya returns other hand back to the chips.\n\nYou are given Vasya's keyboard and the text.

A natural problem occurred: on the one hand, it is not clear how many T-shirts of what sizes should be ordered, and on the other hand, one doesn't want to order too many T-shirts (and we do not exactly paper the walls with the oversupply). After considerable brain racking and some pre-estimating, the sponsor representatives ordered a certain number of T-shirts of sizes S, M, L, XL and XXL. The T-shirts turned out to bring good luck, that's why on the contest day there built up a line of *K* participants willing to get one. Every contestant is characterized by his/her desired T-shirt size (so it happens that for all the participants it is also one of the sizes S, M, L, XL and XXL). The participants come up to get a T-shirt one by one and try to choose the most suitable one, choosing it like this. If there is still a T-shirt of the optimal size left, that he/she takes it without further ado. Otherwise the contestant would prefer to choose a T-shirt with the size as close to the optimal one as possible (the distance between neighboring sizes is considered equal to one). If the variant of choice is not unique, the contestant will take a T-shirt of a bigger size (in case he/she grows more). For example, for a person whose optimal size is L the preference list looks like this: L, XL, M, XXL, S.

Write a python script for the following problem: Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.\n\nShop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following *n* days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in *i*-th day *k**i* products will be put up for sale and exactly *l**i* clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any *f* days from *n* next for sell-outs. On each of *f* chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on *i*-th day shop planned to put up for sale *k**i* products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7*k**i* products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.\n\nNoora's task is to choose *f* days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *f* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105,<=0<=\u2264<=*f*<=\u2264<=*n*) denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.\n\nEach line of the following *n* subsequent lines contains two integers *k**i*,<=*l**i* (0<=\u2264<=*k**i*,<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=109) denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the *i*-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on *i*-th day..

In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2,\u20096,\u20092,\u20092] respectively. So on the first day shop will sell 1 product, on the second\u00a0\u2014 5, on the third\u00a0\u2014 2, on the fourth\u00a0\u2014 2. In total 1\u2009+\u20095\u2009+\u20092\u2009+\u20092\u2009=\u200910 product units.\n\nIn the second example it is possible to sell 5 products, if you choose third day for sell-out."}]}}

The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.\n\nCreating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section. At that, the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section.

Peter said that Bob's triangle is not right-angled, but is almost right-angled: the triangle itself is not right-angled, but it is possible to move one of the points exactly by distance 1 so, that all the coordinates remain integer, and the triangle become right-angled. Bob asks you to help him and find out if Peter tricks him. By the given coordinates of the triangle you should find out if it is right-angled, almost right-angled, or neither of these.\nInput specification: The first input line contains 6 space-separated integers *x*1,<=*y*1,<=*x*2,<=*y*2,<=*x*3,<=*y*3 \u2014 coordinates of the triangle's vertices. All the coordinates are integer and don't exceed 100 in absolute value. It's guaranteed that the triangle is nondegenerate, i.e. its total area is not zero.. Output specification: If the given triangle is right-angled, output RIGHT, if it is almost right-angled, output ALMOST, and if it is neither of these, output NEITHER.\nDemo input: ['0 0 2 0 0 1\\n', '2 3 4 5 6 6\\n', '-1 0 2 0 0 1\\n'], Demo output: ['RIGHT\\n', 'NEITHER\\n', 'ALMOST\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Would you succeed with the same task if you were on his place?\n\nOne day, when he came to his friend Evan, Om Nom didn't find him at home but he found two bags with candies. The first was full of blue candies and the second bag was full of red candies. Om Nom knows that each red candy weighs *W**r* grams and each blue candy weighs *W**b* grams.

Om Nom knows if he eats more than *C* grams of candies, he will get sick. Om Nom thinks that it isn't proper to leave candy leftovers, so he can only eat a whole candy.

But lately thieves started to sneak into the garden at nights and steal the fruit too often. Vasya can\u2019t spend the nights in the garden and guard the fruit because there\u2019s no house in the garden! Vasya had been saving in for some time and finally he decided to build the house. The rest is simple: he should choose in which part of the garden to build the house. In the evening he sat at his table and drew the garden\u2019s plan. On the plan the garden is represented as a rectangular checkered field *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* in size divided into squares whose side length is 1. In some squares Vasya marked the trees growing there (one shouldn\u2019t plant the trees too close to each other that\u2019s why one square contains no more than one tree). Vasya wants to find a rectangular land lot *a*<=\u00d7<=*b* squares in size to build a house on, at that the land lot border should go along the lines of the grid that separates the squares.

Help her to calculate the expected maximum number of dots she could get after tossing the dice *n* times.\nInput specification: A single line contains two integers *m* and *n* (1<=\u2264<=*m*,<=*n*<=\u2264<=105).. Output specification: Output a single real number corresponding to the expected maximum. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10<=<=-<=4.\nDemo input: ['6 1\\n', '6 3\\n', '2 2\\n'], Demo output: ['3.500000000000\\n', '4.958333333333\\n', '1.750000000000\\n']\nNote: Consider the third test example. If you've made two tosses:\n 1.  You can get 1 in the first toss, and 2 in the second. Maximum equals to 2. 1.  You can get 1 in the first toss, and 1 in the second. Maximum equals to 1. 1.  You can get 2 in the first toss, and 1 in the second. Maximum equals to 2. 1.  You can get 2 in the first toss, and 2 in the second. Maximum equals to 2. \nThe probability of each outcome is 0.25, that is expectation equals to: \n\nYou can read about expectation using the following link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: You helped Dima to have a great weekend, but it's time to work. Naturally, Dima, as all other men who have girlfriends, does everything wrong.\n\nInna and Dima are now in one room. Inna tells Dima off for everything he does in her presence. After Inna tells him off for something, she goes to another room, walks there in circles muttering about how useless her sweetheart is. During that time Dima has time to peacefully complete *k*<=-<=1 tasks. Then Inna returns and tells Dima off for the next task he does in her presence and goes to another room again. It continues until Dima is through with his tasks.\n\nOverall, Dima has *n* tasks to do, each task has a unique number from 1 to *n*. Dima loves order, so he does tasks consecutively, starting from some task. For example, if Dima has 6 tasks to do in total, then, if he starts from the 5-th task, the order is like that: first Dima does the 5-th task, then the 6-th one, then the 1-st one, then the 2-nd one, then the 3-rd one, then the 4-th one.\n\nInna tells Dima off (only lovingly and appropriately!) so often and systematically that he's very well learned the power with which she tells him off for each task. Help Dima choose the first task so that in total he gets told off with as little power as possible.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n*,<=*k*\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105). The second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=103), where *a**i* is the power Inna tells Dima off with if she is present in the room while he is doing the *i*-th task.\n\nIt is guaranteed that *n* is divisible by *k*.. Output specification: In a single line print the number of the task Dima should start with to get told off with as little power as possible. If there are multiple solutions, print the one with the minimum number of the first task to do.\nDemo input: ['6 2\\n3 2 1 6 5 4\\n', '10 5\\n1 3 5 7 9 9 4 1 8 5\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '3\\n']\nNote: Explanation of the first example.\n\nIf Dima starts from the first task, Inna tells him off with power 3, then Dima can do one more task (as *k* = 2), then Inna tells him off for the third task with power 1, then she tells him off for the fifth task with power 5. Thus, Dima gets told off with total power 3 + 1 + 5 = 9. If Dima started from the second task, for example, then Inna would tell him off for tasks 2, 4 and 6 with power 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \n\nExplanation of the second example.\n\nIn the second example *k* = 5, thus, Dima manages to complete 4 tasks in-between the telling off sessions. Thus, Inna tells Dima off for tasks number 1 and 6 (if he starts from 1 or 6), 2 and 7 (if he starts from 2 or 7) and so on. The optimal answer is to start from task 3 or 8, 3 has a smaller number, so the answer is 3."}]}}

One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.\n\nBeroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word.

Vitaly calls a good number excellent, if the sum of its digits is a good number.\n\nFor example, let's say that Vitaly's favourite digits are 1 and 3, then number 12 isn't good and numbers 13 or 311 are. Also, number 111 is excellent and number 11 isn't. \n\nNow Vitaly is wondering, how many excellent numbers of length exactly *n* are there. As this number can be rather large, he asks you to count the remainder after dividing it by 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\n\nA number's length is the number of digits in its decimal representation without leading zeroes.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers: *a*, *b*, *n* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=&lt;<=*b*<=\u2264<=9,<=1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=106)..

As you know, the lake shore consists only of straight sections, directed to the north, south, east or west.\n\nLet's introduce a system of coordinates, directing the *Ox* axis from west to east, and the *Oy* axis from south to north. As a starting position of the race the southernmost point of the track is selected (and if there are several such points, the most western among them). The participants start the race, moving to the north.

A matching is a subset of roads such that no two roads in this subset has common endpoint. They can destruct these roads in parallel, i. e. the total destruction time is a maximum over destruction times of all selected roads.\n\nThey want two conditions to be satisfied:\n 1.  The remaining roads form a proper coloring. 1.  Destructing time of this matching is minimized. \nThe remaining roads after destructing this matching form a proper coloring if and only if no two roads of the same color have same endpoint, or, in the other words, edges of each color should form a matching.\n\nThere is no programmer in Mafia.

Write a python script for the following problem: There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: \n -  alloc n \u2014 to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; \nThe memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.\n\nThe first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.\nInput specification: The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100;1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *t* \u2014 the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* \u2014 the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.. Output specification: Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession.

Write a python script for the following problem: Since Sonya has just learned the basics of matrices, she decided to play with them a little bit.\n\nSonya imagined a new type of matrices that she called rhombic matrices. These matrices have exactly one zero, while all other cells have the Manhattan distance to the cell containing the zero. The cells with equal numbers have the form of a rhombus, that is why Sonya called this type so.\n\nThe Manhattan distance between two cells ($x_1$, $y_1$) and ($x_2$, $y_2$) is defined as $|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$. For example, the Manhattan distance between the cells $(5, 2)$ and $(7, 1)$ equals to $|5-7|+|2-1|=3$.\n\nNote that rhombic matrices are uniquely defined by $n$, $m$, and the coordinates of the cell containing the zero.\n\nShe drew a $n\\times m$ rhombic matrix. She believes that you can not recreate the matrix if she gives you only the elements of this matrix in some arbitrary order (i.e., the sequence of $n\\cdot m$ numbers). Note that Sonya will not give you $n$ and $m$, so only the sequence of numbers in this matrix will be at your disposal.\n\nWrite a program that finds such an $n\\times m$ rhombic matrix whose elements are the same as the elements in the sequence in some order.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\\leq t\\leq 10^6$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cells in the matrix.\n\nThe second line contains $t$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_t$ ($0\\leq a_i&lt; t$)\u00a0\u2014 the values in the cells in arbitrary order.. Output specification: In the first line, print two positive integers $n$ and $m$ ($n \\times m = t$)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the matrix.\n\nIn the second line, print two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1\\leq x\\leq n$, $1\\leq y\\leq m$)\u00a0\u2014 the row number and the column number where the cell with $0$ is located.\n\nIf there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.

Personal watches of each robber are divided in two parts: first of them has the smallest possible number of places that is necessary to display any integer from 0 to *n*<=-<=1, while the second has the smallest possible number of places that is necessary to display any integer from 0 to *m*<=-<=1. Finally, if some value of hours or minutes can be displayed using less number of places in base 7 than this watches have, the required number of zeroes is added at the beginning of notation.\n\nNote that to display number 0 section of the watches is required to have at least one place.\n\nLittle robber wants to know the number of moments of time (particular values of hours and minutes), such that all digits displayed on the watches are distinct. Help her calculate this number.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers, given in the decimal notation, *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 the number of hours in one day and the number of minutes in one hour, respectively.. Output specification: Print one integer in decimal notation\u00a0\u2014 the number of different pairs of hour and minute, such that all digits displayed on the watches are distinct.\nDemo input: ['2 3\\n', '8 2\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n', '5\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, possible pairs are: (0:\u20091), (0:\u20092), (1:\u20090), (1:\u20092).\n\nIn the second sample, possible pairs are: (02:\u20091), (03:\u20091), (04:\u20091), (05:\u20091), (06:\u20091)."}]}}

Guests from all over the kingdom gather here to discuss new trends in the world of confectionery. Yet some of the things discussed here are not supposed to be disclosed to the general public: the information can cause discord in the kingdom of Sweetland in case it turns out to reach the wrong hands. So it's a necessity to not let any uninvited guests in.\n\nThere are 26 entrances in Jelly Castle, enumerated with uppercase English letters from A to Z. Because of security measures, each guest is known to be assigned an entrance he should enter the castle through. The door of each entrance is opened right before the first guest's arrival and closed right after the arrival of the last guest that should enter the castle through this entrance. No two guests can enter the castle simultaneously.\n\nFor an entrance to be protected from possible intrusion, a candy guard should be assigned to it. There are *k* such guards in the castle, so if there are more than *k* opened doors, one of them is going to be left unguarded! Notice that a guard can't leave his post until the door he is assigned to is closed.\n\nSlastyona had a suspicion that there could be uninvited guests at the evening.

Jon agrees to Sam's proposal and Sam sets off his journey to the Citadel. However becoming a trainee at the Citadel is not a cakewalk and hence the maesters at the Citadel gave Sam a problem to test his eligibility. \n\nInitially Sam has a list with a single element *n*. Then he has to perform certain operations on this list. In each operation Sam must remove any element *x*, such that *x*<=&gt;<=1, from the list and insert at the same position , ,  sequentially.

Of course, to avoid the teacher's suspicion, Vasya wants to remove as few measurement results as possible from his notes.\n\nHelp Vasya, find what minimum number of measurement results he will have to erase from his notes so that the largest and the smallest of the remaining results of the measurements differed in no more than two times.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of measurements Vasya made. The second line contains *n* integers *c*1,<=*c*2,<=...,<=*c**n* (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=5000) \u2014 the results of the measurements. The numbers on the second line are separated by single spaces.. Output specification: Print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of results Vasya will have to remove.\nDemo input: ['6\\n4 5 3 8 3 7\\n', '4\\n4 3 2 4\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: In the first sample you can remove the fourth and the sixth measurement results (values 8 and 7). Then the maximum of the remaining values will be 5, and the minimum one will be 3. Or else, you can remove the third and fifth results (both equal 3). After that the largest remaining result will be 8, and the smallest one will be 4."}]}}

The Modcrab has *h*2 health points and an attack power of *a*2. Knowing that, Vova has decided to buy a lot of strong healing potions and to prepare for battle.\n\nVova's character has *h*1 health points and an attack power of *a*1. Also he has a large supply of healing potions, each of which increases his current amount of health points by *c*1 when Vova drinks a potion. All potions are identical to each other. It is guaranteed that *c*1<=&gt;<=*a*2.\n\nThe battle consists of multiple phases. In the beginning of each phase, Vova can either attack the monster (thus reducing its health by *a*1) or drink a healing potion (it increases Vova's health by *c*1; Vova's health can exceed *h*1).

For the *i*-th day there are four options:\n 1.  on this day the gym is closed and the contest is not carried out; 1.  on this day the gym is closed and the contest is carried out; 1.  on this day the gym is open and the contest is not carried out; 1.  on this day the gym is open and the contest is carried out. \nOn each of days Vasya can either have a rest or write the contest (if it is carried out on this day), or do sport (if the gym is open on this day).\n\nFind the minimum number of days on which Vasya will have a rest (it means, he will not do sport and write the contest at the same time). The only limitation that Vasya has \u2014 he does not want to do the same activity on two consecutive days: it means, he will not do sport on two consecutive days, and write the contest on two consecutive days.\nInput specification: The first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of days of Vasya's vacations.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence of integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=3) separated by space, where: \n -  *a**i* equals 0, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is closed and the contest is not carried out; -  *a**i* equals 1, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is closed, but the contest is carried out; -  *a**i* equals 2, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is open and the contest is not carried out; -  *a**i* equals 3, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is open and the contest is carried out.. Output specification: Print the minimum possible number of days on which Vasya will have a rest. Remember that Vasya refuses:\n -  to do sport on any two consecutive days, -  to write the contest on any two consecutive days.\nDemo input: ['4\\n1 3 2 0\\n', '7\\n1 3 3 2 1 2 3\\n', '2\\n2 2\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '0\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: In the first test Vasya can write the contest on the day number 1 and do sport on the day number 3. Thus, he will have a rest for only 2 days.\n\nIn the second test Vasya should write contests on days number 1, 3, 5 and 7, in other days do sport. Thus, he will not have a rest for a single day.\n\nIn the third test Vasya can do sport either on a day number 1 or number 2. He can not do sport in two days, because it will be contrary to the his limitation. Thus, he will have a rest for only one day."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Simon and Antisimon play a game. Initially each player receives one fixed positive integer that doesn't change throughout the game. Simon receives number *a* and Antisimon receives number *b*. They also have a heap of *n* stones. The players take turns to make a move and Simon starts. During a move a player should take from the heap the number of stones equal to the greatest common divisor of the fixed number he has received and the number of stones left in the heap.

Let *gcd*(*a*,\u2009*b*) represent the operation of calculating the greatest common divisor of numbers *a* and *b*.
