Also, each card earns some value in points assigned to it: cards with value from two to ten earn from 2 to 10 points, correspondingly. An ace can either earn 1 or 11, whatever the player wishes. The picture cards (king, queen and jack) earn 10 points. The number of points a card earns does not depend on the suit. The rules of the game are very simple.

Note, that leap years have unusual number of days in February.\n\nLook at the sample to understand what borders are included in the aswer.\nInput specification: The first two lines contain two dates, each date is in the format yyyy:mm:dd (1900<=\u2264<=*yyyy*<=\u2264<=2038 and yyyy:mm:dd is a legal date)..

As a result, the Kingdom healers had already had three appointments with the merchants who were asked to sell, say, exactly 0.273549107 beer barrels. To deal with the problem somehow, the King issued an order obliging rounding up all numbers to the closest integer to simplify calculations. Specifically, the order went like this:\n-  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is strictly less than 0.5, then the rounded up number coincides with the number\u2019s integer part. -  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is not less than 0.5, the rounded up number is obtained if we add 1 to the last digit of the number\u2019s integer part.-  If the number\u2019s integer part ends with digit 9, to round up the numbers one should go to Vasilisa the Wise. In the whole Kingdom she is the only one who can perform the tricky operation of carrying into the next position. \nMerchants found the algorithm very sophisticated and they asked you (the ACMers) to help them.

He must continue with these operations until all the elements in the list are either 0 or 1.\n\nNow the masters want the total number of 1s in the range *l* to *r* (1-indexed). Sam wants to become a maester but unfortunately he cannot solve this problem. Can you help Sam to pass the eligibility test?\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *l*, *r* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=&lt;<=250, 0<=\u2264<=*r*<=-<=*l*<=\u2264<=105, *r*<=\u2265<=1, *l*<=\u2265<=1) \u2013 initial element and the range *l* to *r*.\n\nIt is guaranteed that *r* is not greater than the length of the final list..

A rule can be denoted by integers *v*, *u* and *w*. As the result of this action, the passing fee of all roads on the shortest path from *u* to *v* increases by *w* dollars. \n\n2.

The confidences of the remaining children will get equal to \u2009-\u20092,\u20091,\u20093,\u20091, respectively. Thus, the second child also cries at the volume of 1 and run to the exit. The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 0,\u20092,\u20090. Then the third child will go to the office, and cry with volume 5. The other children won't bear this, and with a loud cry they will run to the exit.\n\nIn the second sample, first the first child goes into the office, he will cry with volume 4. The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 5,\u2009\u2009-\u20091,\u20096,\u20098. Thus, the third child will cry with the volume of 1 and run to the exit. The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 5,\u20095,\u20097. After that, the second child goes to the office and cry with the volume of 5. The confidences of the remaining children will be equal to 0,\u20093. Then the fourth child will go into the office and cry with the volume of 2. Because of this the confidence of the fifth child will be 1, and he will go into the office last."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: A famous Berland's painter Kalevitch likes to shock the public. One of his last obsessions is chess. For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards.\n\nAs before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8<=\u00d7<=8 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke.\n\nKalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client's requirements.\n\nIt goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything \u2014 for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's needs.

For each person we know the arrival time: the *i*-th person comes exactly at *h**i* hours *m**i* minutes. The cafe spends less than a minute to serve each client, but if a client comes in and sees that there is no free cash, than he doesn't want to wait and leaves the cafe immediately. \n\nValera is very greedy, so he wants to serve all *n* customers next day (and get more profit).

Write a python script for the following problem: In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.\n\nThere are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.\n\nOfficer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:\n -  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$; -  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. \nFor example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\n\nThe structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.\n\nFormally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.\n\nBerland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.\n\nSuppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ \u2014 one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.\n\nLet's look at the following example:\n\nIf officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.\n\nIf officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.\n\nTo answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.\n\nYou should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i &lt; i$), where $p_i$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $i$. The commander has index $1$ and doesn't have any superiors.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query is given as a pair ($u_i, k_i$) ($1 \\le u_i, k_i \\le n$), where $u_i$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $k_i$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence.. Output specification: Print $q$ numbers, where the $i$-th number is the officer at the position $k_i$ in the list which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if it starts spreading from officer $u_i$. Print \"-1\" if the number of officers which receive the command is less than $k_i$.\n\nYou should process queries independently. They do not affect each other.\nDemo input: ['9 6\\n1 1 1 3 5 3 5 7\\n3 1\\n1 5\\n3 4\\n7 3\\n1 8\\n1 9\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n6\\n8\\n-1\\n9\\n4\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Petya wanted to create a maximally simple language that would be enough to chat with friends, that's why all the language's grammar can be described with the following set of rules:\n-  There are three parts of speech: the adjective, the noun, the verb. Each word in his language is an adjective, noun or verb. -  There are two genders: masculine and feminine. Each word in his language has gender either masculine or feminine. -  Masculine adjectives end with -lios, and feminine adjectives end with -liala. -  Masculine nouns end with -etr, and feminime nouns end with -etra. -  Masculine verbs end with -initis, and feminime verbs end with -inites. -  Thus, each word in the Petya's language has one of the six endings, given above. There are no other endings in Petya's language. -  It is accepted that the whole word consists of an ending. That is, words \"lios\", \"liala\", \"etr\" and so on belong to the Petya's language. -  There aren't any punctuation marks, grammatical tenses, singular/plural forms or other language complications. -  A sentence is either exactly one valid language word or exactly one statement. \nStatement is any sequence of the Petya's language, that satisfy both conditions:\n-  Words in statement follow in the following order (from the left to the right): zero or more adjectives followed by exactly one noun followed by zero or more verbs. -  All words in the statement should have the same gender.\nAfter Petya's friend Vasya wrote instant messenger (an instant messaging program) that supported the Petya's language, Petya wanted to add spelling and grammar checking to the program. As Vasya was in the country and Petya didn't feel like waiting, he asked you to help him with this problem.

Write a python script for the following problem: Bizon the Champion isn't just a bison. He also is a favorite of the \"Bizons\" team.\n\nAt a competition the \"Bizons\" got the following problem: \"You are given two distinct words (strings of English letters), *s* and *t*. You need to transform word *s* into word *t*\". The task looked simple to the guys because they know the suffix data structures well. Bizon Senior loves suffix automaton.

By applying it once to a string, he can swap any two characters of this string. The guys do not know anything about the suffix tree, but it can help them do much more. \n\nBizon the Champion wonders whether the \"Bizons\" can solve the problem. Perhaps, the solution do not require both data structures. Find out whether the guys can solve the problem and if they can, how do they do it? Can they solve it either only with use of suffix automaton or only with use of suffix array or they need both structures?

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Most C/C++ programmers know about excellent opportunities that preprocessor #define directives give; but many know as well about the problems that can arise because of their careless use.\n\nIn this problem we consider the following model of #define constructions (also called macros). Each macro has its name and value. The generic syntax for declaring a macro is the following:\n\n#define macro_name macro_value\n\nAfter the macro has been declared, \"macro_name\" is replaced with \"macro_value\" each time it is met in the program (only the whole tokens can be replaced; i.e. \"macro_name\" is replaced only when it is surrounded by spaces or other non-alphabetic symbol). A \"macro_value\" within our model can only be an arithmetic expression consisting of variables, four arithmetic operations, brackets, and also the names of previously declared macros (in this case replacement is performed sequentially). The process of replacing macros with their values is called substitution.\n\nOne of the main problems arising while using macros \u2014 the situation when as a result of substitution we get an arithmetic expression with the changed order of calculation because of different priorities of the operations.\n\nLet's consider the following example. Say, we declared such a #define construction:\n\n#define sum x + y\n\nand further in the program the expression \"2 * sum\" is calculated. After macro substitution is performed we get \"2 * x + y\", instead of intuitively expected \"2 * (x + y)\".\n\nLet's call the situation \"suspicious\", if after the macro substitution the order of calculation changes, falling outside the bounds of some macro. Thus, your task is to find out by the given set of #define definitions and the given expression if this expression is suspicious or not.\n\nLet's speak more formally. We should perform an ordinary macros substitution in the given expression. Moreover, we should perform a \"safe\" macros substitution in the expression, putting in brackets each macro value; after this, guided by arithmetic rules of brackets expansion, we can omit some of the brackets. If there exist a way to get an expression, absolutely coinciding with the expression that is the result of an ordinary substitution (character-by-character, but ignoring spaces), then this expression and the macros system are called correct, otherwise \u2014 suspicious.\n\nNote that we consider the \"/\" operation as the usual mathematical division, not the integer division like in C/C++. That's why, for example, in the expression \"a*(b/c)\" we can omit brackets to get the expression \"a*b/c\".\nInput specification: The first line contains the only number *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the amount of #define constructions in the given program.\n\nThen there follow *n* lines, each of them contains just one #define construction. Each construction has the following syntax:\n\n#define name expression\n\nwhere\n -  name \u2014 the macro name, -  expression \u2014 the expression with which the given macro will be replaced. An expression is a non-empty string, containing digits,names of variables, names of previously declared macros, round brackets and operational signs +-*/. It is guaranteed that the expression (before and after macros substitution) is a correct arithmetic expression, having no unary operations. The expression contains only non-negative integers, not exceeding 109. \nAll the names (#define constructions' names and names of their arguments) are strings of case-sensitive Latin characters. It is guaranteed that the name of any variable is different from any #define construction.\n\nThen, the last line contains an expression that you are to check. This expression is non-empty and satisfies the same limitations as the expressions in #define constructions.\n\nThe input lines may contain any number of spaces anywhere, providing these spaces do not break the word \"define\" or the names of constructions and variables. In particular, there can be any number of spaces before and after the \"#\" symbol.\n\nThe length of any line from the input file does not exceed 100 characters.. Output specification: Output \"OK\", if the expression is correct according to the above given criterion, otherwise output \"Suspicious\".\nDemo input: ['1\\n#define sum x + y\\n1 * sum\\n', '1\\n#define sum  (x + y)\\nsum - sum\\n', '4\\n#define sum  x + y\\n#define mul  a * b\\n#define div  a / b\\n#define expr sum + mul * div * mul\\nexpr\\n', '3\\n#define SumSafe   (a+b)\\n#define DivUnsafe  a/b\\n#define DenominatorUnsafe  a*b\\n((SumSafe) + DivUnsafe/DivUnsafe + x/DenominatorUnsafe)\\n'], Demo output: ['Suspicious\\n', 'OK\\n', 'OK\\n', 'Suspicious\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Also, he carefully wrote down all the operations and their results to his event log, following the format: \n -  insert *x*\u00a0\u2014 put the element with value *x* in the heap; -  getMin *x*\u00a0\u2014 the value of the minimum element contained in the heap was equal to *x*; -  removeMin\u00a0\u2014 the minimum element was extracted from the heap (only one instance, if there were many). \nAll the operations were correct, i.e. there was at least one element in the heap each time getMin or removeMin operations were applied.\n\nWhile Petya was away for a lunch, his little brother Vova came to the room, took away some of the pages from Petya's log and used them to make paper boats.\n\nNow Vova is worried, if he made Petya's sequence of operations inconsistent. For example, if one apply operations one-by-one in the order they are written in the event log, results of getMin operations might differ from the results recorded by Petya, and some of getMin or removeMin operations may be incorrect, as the heap is empty at the moment they are applied.\n\nNow Vova wants to add some new operation records to the event log in order to make the resulting sequence of operations correct. That is, the result of each getMin operation is equal to the result in the record, and the heap is non-empty when getMin ad removeMin are applied. Vova wants to complete this as fast as possible, as the Petya may get back at any moment. He asks you to add the least possible number of operation records to the current log.

Write a python script for the following problem: You helped Dima to have a great weekend, but it's time to work. Naturally, Dima, as all other men who have girlfriends, does everything wrong.\n\nInna and Dima are now in one room. Inna tells Dima off for everything he does in her presence. After Inna tells him off for something, she goes to another room, walks there in circles muttering about how useless her sweetheart is. During that time Dima has time to peacefully complete *k*<=-<=1 tasks. Then Inna returns and tells Dima off for the next task he does in her presence and goes to another room again. It continues until Dima is through with his tasks.\n\nOverall, Dima has *n* tasks to do, each task has a unique number from 1 to *n*. Dima loves order, so he does tasks consecutively, starting from some task. For example, if Dima has 6 tasks to do in total, then, if he starts from the 5-th task, the order is like that: first Dima does the 5-th task, then the 6-th one, then the 1-st one, then the 2-nd one, then the 3-rd one, then the 4-th one.\n\nInna tells Dima off (only lovingly and appropriately!) so often and systematically that he's very well learned the power with which she tells him off for each task. Help Dima choose the first task so that in total he gets told off with as little power as possible.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n*,<=*k*\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105). The second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=103), where *a**i* is the power Inna tells Dima off with if she is present in the room while he is doing the *i*-th task.\n\nIt is guaranteed that *n* is divisible by *k*.. Output specification: In a single line print the number of the task Dima should start with to get told off with as little power as possible. If there are multiple solutions, print the one with the minimum number of the first task to do.\nDemo input: ['6 2\\n3 2 1 6 5 4\\n', '10 5\\n1 3 5 7 9 9 4 1 8 5\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '3\\n']\nNote: Explanation of the first example.\n\nIf Dima starts from the first task, Inna tells him off with power 3, then Dima can do one more task (as *k* = 2), then Inna tells him off for the third task with power 1, then she tells him off for the fifth task with power 5. Thus, Dima gets told off with total power 3 + 1 + 5 = 9. If Dima started from the second task, for example, then Inna would tell him off for tasks 2, 4 and 6 with power 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \n\nExplanation of the second example.\n\nIn the second example *k* = 5, thus, Dima manages to complete 4 tasks in-between the telling off sessions. Thus, Inna tells Dima off for tasks number 1 and 6 (if he starts from 1 or 6), 2 and 7 (if he starts from 2 or 7) and so on. The optimal answer is to start from task 3 or 8, 3 has a smaller number, so the answer is 3."}]}}

However, Vasilisa the Wise does not know what the box's secret is, since she cannot open it again. She hopes that you will help her one more time with that.\n\nThe box's lock looks as follows: it contains 4 identical deepenings for gems as a 2<=\u00d7<=2 square, and some integer numbers are written at the lock's edge near the deepenings. The example of a lock is given on the picture below.\n\nThe box is accompanied with 9 gems. Their shapes match the deepenings' shapes and each gem contains one number from 1 to 9 (each number is written on exactly one gem). The box will only open after it is decorated with gems correctly: that is, each deepening in the lock should be filled with exactly one gem. Also, the sums of numbers in the square's rows, columns and two diagonals of the square should match the numbers written at the lock's edge. For example, the above lock will open if we fill the deepenings with gems with numbers as is shown on the picture below.\n\nNow Vasilisa the Wise wants to define, given the numbers on the box's lock, which gems she should put in the deepenings to open the box.

Write a python script for the following problem: In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.\n\nThere are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.\n\nOfficer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:\n -  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$; -  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. \nFor example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\n\nThe structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.\n\nFormally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.\n\nBerland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.\n\nSuppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ \u2014 one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.\n\nLet's look at the following example:\n\nIf officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.\n\nIf officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.\n\nTo answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.\n\nYou should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i &lt; i$), where $p_i$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $i$. The commander has index $1$ and doesn't have any superiors.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query is given as a pair ($u_i, k_i$) ($1 \\le u_i, k_i \\le n$), where $u_i$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $k_i$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence.. Output specification: Print $q$ numbers, where the $i$-th number is the officer at the position $k_i$ in the list which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if it starts spreading from officer $u_i$. Print \"-1\" if the number of officers which receive the command is less than $k_i$.\n\nYou should process queries independently. They do not affect each other.\nDemo input: ['9 6\\n1 1 1 3 5 3 5 7\\n3 1\\n1 5\\n3 4\\n7 3\\n1 8\\n1 9\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n6\\n8\\n-1\\n9\\n4\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Bob is a farmer. He has a large pasture with many sheep. Recently, he has lost some of them due to wolf attacks. He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of dogs.\nDemo input: ['6 6\\n..S...\\n..S.W.\\n.S....\\n..W...\\n...W..\\n......\\n', '1 2\\nSW\\n', '5 5\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS....\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n..SD..\\n..SDW.\\n.SD...\\n.DW...\\nDD.W..\\n......\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS.D..\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n']\nNote: In the first example, we can split the pasture into two halves, one containing wolves and one containing sheep. Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

His today's task is to type up an already well-designed story using his favorite text editor.\n\nArcady types words, punctuation signs and spaces one after another. Each letter and each sign (including line feed) requires one keyboard click in order to be printed. Moreover, when Arcady has a non-empty prefix of some word on the screen, the editor proposes a possible autocompletion for this word, more precisely one of the already printed words such that its prefix matches the currently printed prefix if this word is unique. For example, if Arcady has already printed \u00abcodeforces\u00bb, \u00abcoding\u00bb and \u00abcodeforces\u00bb once again, then there will be no autocompletion attempt for \u00abcod\u00bb, but if he proceeds with \u00abcode\u00bb, the editor will propose \u00abcodeforces\u00bb.\n\nWith a single click Arcady can follow the editor's proposal, i.e. to transform the current prefix to it. Note that no additional symbols are printed after the autocompletion (no spaces, line feeds, etc). What is the minimum number of keyboard clicks Arcady has to perform to print the entire text, if he is not allowed to move the cursor or erase the already printed symbols?\n\nA word here is a contiguous sequence of latin letters bordered by spaces, punctuation signs and line/text beginnings/ends.

Write a python script for the following problem: A famous Berland's painter Kalevitch likes to shock the public. One of his last obsessions is chess. For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards.\n\nAs before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8<=\u00d7<=8 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke.\n\nKalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client's requirements.\n\nIt goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything \u2014 for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's needs. You are asked to help Kalevitch with this task.\nInput specification: The input file contains 8 lines, each of the lines contains 8 characters. The given matrix describes the client's requirements, W character stands for a white square, and B character \u2014 for a square painted black.\n\nIt is guaranteed that client's requirments can be fulfilled with a sequence of allowed strokes (vertical/column or horizontal/row).. Output specification: Output the only number \u2014 the minimum amount of rows and columns that Kalevitch has to paint on the white chessboard to meet the client's requirements.\nDemo input: ['WWWBWWBW\\nBBBBBBBB\\nWWWBWWBW\\nWWWBWWBW\\nWWWBWWBW\\nWWWBWWBW\\nWWWBWWBW\\nWWWBWWBW\\n', 'WWWWWWWW\\nBBBBBBBB\\nWWWWWWWW\\nWWWWWWWW\\nWWWWWWWW\\nWWWWWWWW\\nWWWWWWWW\\nWWWWWWWW\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

He was in such a hurry to launch it for the first time that he plugged in the power wires without giving it a proper glance and started experimenting right away. After a while Mike observed that the wires ended up entangled and now have to be untangled again.\n\nThe device is powered by two wires \"plus\" and \"minus\". The wires run along the floor from the wall (on the left) to the device (on the right). Both the wall and the device have two contacts in them on the same level, into which the wires are plugged in some order. The wires are considered entangled if there are one or more places where one wire runs above the other one. For example, the picture below has four such places (top view):\n\nMike knows the sequence in which the wires run above each other. Mike also noticed that on the left side, the \"plus\" wire is always plugged into the top contact (as seen on the picture). He would like to untangle the wires without unplugging them and without moving the device. Determine if it is possible to do that. A wire can be freely moved and stretched on the floor, but cannot be cut.\n\nTo understand the problem better please read the notes to the test samples.\nInput specification: The single line of the input contains a sequence of characters \"+\" and \"-\" of length *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000).

The armies of flatlanders stand on the borders of circles, the circles' centers are in the surrounded cities. At any moment all points of the flatland ring can begin to move quickly in the direction of the city \u2014 that's the strategy the flatlanders usually follow when they besiege cities.\n\nThe berlanders are sure that they can repel the enemy's attack if they learn the exact time the attack starts. For that they need to construct a radar that would register any movement at the distance of at most *r* from it. Thus, we can install a radar at such point, that at least one point of the enemy ring will be in its detecting range (that is, at a distance of at most *r*). Then the radar can immediately inform about the enemy's attack. \n\nDue to the newest technologies, we can place a radar at any point without any problems. But the problem is that the berlanders have the time to make only one radar. Besides, the larger the detection radius (*r*) is, the more the radar costs.\n\nThat's why Vasya's task (that is, your task) is to find the minimum possible detection radius for the radar. In other words, your task is to find the minimum radius *r* (*r*<=\u2265<=0) such, that a radar with radius *r* can be installed at some point and it can register the start of the movements of both flatland rings from that point. \n\nIn this problem you can consider the cities as material points, the attacking enemy rings - as circles with centers in the cities, the radar's detection range \u2014 as a disk (including the border) with the center at the point where the radar is placed.\nInput specification: The input files consist of two lines.

But if chosen numbers are different, then one of the robots gets a point: 3 beats 2, 2 beats 1 and 1 beats 3. \n\nBoth robots' programs make them choose their numbers in such a way that their choice in (*i*<=+<=1)-th game depends only on the numbers chosen by them in *i*-th game. \n\nIlya knows that the robots will play *k* games, Alice will choose number *a* in the first game, and Bob will choose *b* in the first game. He also knows both robots' programs and can tell what each robot will choose depending on their choices in previous game. Ilya doesn't want to wait until robots play all *k* games, so he asks you to predict the number of points they will have after the final game.\nInput specification: The first line contains three numbers *k*, *a*, *b* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=1018, 1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=3). \n\nThen 3 lines follow, *i*-th of them containing 3 numbers *A**i*,<=1, *A**i*,<=2, *A**i*,<=3, where *A**i*,<=*j* represents Alice's choice in the game if Alice chose *i* in previous game and Bob chose *j* (1<=\u2264<=*A**i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=3). \n\nThen 3 lines follow, *i*-th of them containing 3 numbers *B**i*,<=1, *B**i*,<=2, *B**i*,<=3, where *B**i*,<=*j* represents Bob's choice in the game if Alice chose *i* in previous game and Bob chose *j* (1<=\u2264<=*B**i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=3).. Output specification: Print two numbers. First of them has to be equal to the number of points Alice will have, and second of them must be Bob's score after *k* games.\nDemo input: ['10 2 1\\n1 1 1\\n1 1 1\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 2\\n2 2 2\\n2 2 2\\n', '8 1 1\\n2 2 1\\n3 3 1\\n3 1 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 1 1\\n1 2 3\\n', '5 1 1\\n1 2 2\\n2 2 2\\n2 2 2\\n1 2 2\\n2 2 2\\n2 2 2\\n'], Demo output: ['1 9\\n', '5 2\\n', '0 0\\n']\nNote: In the second example game goes like this:\n\n<img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/1e21b6e200707470571d69c9946ace6b56f5279b.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\nThe fourth and the seventh game are won by Bob, the first game is draw and the rest are won by Alice."}]}}

For example, 19 = 7 + 11 + 1, or 13 = 5 + 7 + 1.\n\nTwo prime numbers are called neighboring if there are no other prime numbers between them.\n\nYou are to help Nick, and find out if he is right or wrong.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000) and *k* (0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=1000).. Output specification: Output YES if at least *k* prime numbers from 2 to *n* inclusively can be expressed as it was described above. Otherwise output NO.\nDemo input: ['27 2\\n', '45 7\\n'], Demo output: ['YES', 'NO']\nNote: In the first sample the answer is YES since at least two numbers can be expressed as it was described (for example, 13 and 19). In the second sample the answer is NO since it is impossible to express 7 prime numbers from 2 to 45 in the desired form."}]}}

Output specification: In the first line output integer *w* \u2014 the largest possible number of teams. \n\nThen print *w* lines, containing three numbers in each line. Each triple represents the indexes of the children forming the team. You can print both the teams, and the numbers in the triplets in any order. The children are numbered from 1 to *n* in the order of their appearance in the input. Each child must participate in no more than one team. If there are several solutions, print any of them.\n\nIf no teams can be compiled, print the only line with value *w* equal to 0.\nDemo input: ['7\\n1 3 1 3 2 1 2\\n', '4\\n2 1 1 2\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n3 5 2\\n6 7 4\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Output specification: If it's impossible to divide the balloons satisfying the conditions above, print $-1$.\n\nOtherwise, print an integer $k$\u00a0\u2014 the number of packets to give to Grigory followed by $k$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$\u00a0\u2014 the indices of those. The order of packets doesn't matter.\n\nIf there are multiple ways to divide balloons, output any of them.\nDemo input: ['3\\n1 2 1\\n', '2\\n5 5\\n', '1\\n10\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n1 2\\n', '-1\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: In the first test Grigory gets $3$ balloons in total while Andrey gets $1$.\n\nIn the second test there's only one way to divide the packets which leads to equal numbers of balloons.\n\nIn the third test one of the boys won't get a packet at all."}]}}

Each cube is associated with the coordinates of its lower left corner, these coordinates are integers for each cube.\n\nThe figure turned out to be stable. This means that for any cube that is not on the ground, there is at least one cube under it such that those two cubes touch by a side or a corner.

It is easy to see that after the figure is disassembled, the integers written on the cubes form a number, written in the *m*-ary positional numerical system (possibly, with a leading zero).

So you might be quite surprised to find out that the primary school in Japan teaches to count using a Soroban \u2014 an abacus developed in Japan. This phenomenon has its reasons, of course, but we are not going to speak about them. Let's have a look at the Soroban's construction.\n\nSoroban consists of some number of rods, each rod contains five beads. We will assume that the rods are horizontal lines. One bead on each rod (the leftmost one) is divided from the others by a bar (the reckoning bar). This single bead is called go-dama and four others are ichi-damas. Each rod is responsible for representing a single digit from 0 to 9. We can obtain the value of a digit by following simple algorithm:\n -  Set the value of a digit equal to 0. -  If the go-dama is shifted to the right, add 5. -  Add the number of ichi-damas shifted to the left. \nThus, the upper rod on the picture shows digit 0, the middle one shows digit 2 and the lower one shows 7. We will consider the top rod to represent the last decimal digit of a number, so the picture shows number 720.\n\nWrite the program that prints the way Soroban shows the given number *n*.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=&lt;<=109)..

Crucial moment is just around the corner: Gogol is ready to release it's new tablet Lastus 3000.\n\nThis new device is equipped with specially designed artificial intelligence (AI). Employees of Pineapple did their best to postpone the release of Lastus 3000 as long as possible. Finally, they found out, that the name of the new artificial intelligence is similar to the name of the phone, that Pineapple released 200 years ago. As all rights on its name belong to Pineapple, they stand on changing the name of Gogol's artificial intelligence.\n\nPineapple insists, that the name of their phone occurs in the name of AI as a substring. Because the name of technology was already printed on all devices, the Gogol's director decided to replace some characters in AI name with \"#\".

This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.\n\nShop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following *n* days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in *i*-th day *k**i* products will be put up for sale and exactly *l**i* clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any *f* days from *n* next for sell-outs. On each of *f* chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on *i*-th day shop planned to put up for sale *k**i* products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7*k**i* products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.\n\nNoora's task is to choose *f* days to maximize total number of sold products.

Thus, in this example, the word and its encoding are the same.\n\nIn the third example Polycarp encoded the word baba. At first, he wrote down the letter a, which was at the position 2, after that the word looked like bba. Then he wrote down the letter b, which was at the position 2, his word looked like ba. After that he wrote down the letter b, which was at the position 1, the word looked like a, and he wrote down that letter a. Thus, the encoding is abba."}]}}

The king has already sent the message to all knights in the kingdom and they in turn agreed to participate in this grand event.\n\nAs for you, you're just a simple peasant. There's no surprise that you slept in this morning and were late for the tournament (it was a weekend, after all). Now you are really curious about the results of the tournament. This time the tournament in Berland went as follows:\n -  There are *n* knights participating in the tournament. Each knight was assigned his unique number \u2014 an integer from 1 to *n*. -  The tournament consisted of *m* fights, in the *i*-th fight the knights that were still in the game with numbers at least *l**i* and at most *r**i* have fought for the right to continue taking part in the tournament. -  After the *i*-th fight among all participants of the fight only one knight won \u2014 the knight number *x**i*, he continued participating in the tournament. Other knights left the tournament. -  The winner of the last (the *m*-th) fight (the knight number *x**m*) became the winner of the tournament. \nYou fished out all the information about the fights from your friends.

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, on a programming lesson little Petya showed how quickly he can create files and folders on the computer. But he got soon fed up with this activity, and he decided to do a much more useful thing. He decided to calculate what folder contains most subfolders (including nested folders, nested folders of nested folders, and so on) and what folder contains most files (including the files in the subfolders).\n\nMore formally, the subfolders of the folder are all its directly nested folders and the subfolders of these nested folders. The given folder is not considered the subfolder of itself. A file is regarded as lying in a folder, if and only if it either lies directly in this folder, or lies in some subfolder of the folder.\n\nFor a better understanding of how to count subfolders and files for calculating the answer, see notes and answers to the samples.\n\nYou are given a few files that Petya has managed to create. The path to each file looks as follows:\n\n*diskName*:\\*folder*1\\*folder*2\\...\\ *folder**n*\\*fileName* \n-  *diskName* is single capital letter from the set {C,D,E,F,G}.-  *folder*1, ..., *folder**n* are folder names. Each folder name is nonempty sequence of lowercase Latin letters and digits from 0 to 9. (*n*<=\u2265<=1)-  *fileName* is a file name in the form of *name*.*extension*, where the *name* and the *extension* are nonempty sequences of lowercase Latin letters and digits from 0 to 9. \nIt is also known that there is no file whose path looks like *diskName*:\\*fileName*. That is, each file is stored in some folder, but there are no files directly in the root. Also let us assume that the disk root is not a folder.\n\nHelp Petya to find the largest number of subfolders, which can be in some folder, and the largest number of files that can be in some folder, counting all its subfolders.\nInput specification: Each line of input data contains the description of one file path. The length of each line does not exceed 100, and overall there are no more than 100 lines. It is guaranteed, that all the paths are correct and meet the above rules. It is also guaranteed, that there are no two completely equal lines. That is, each file is described exactly once.\n\nThere is at least one line in the input data.. Output specification: Print two space-separated numbers. The first one is the maximal number of possible subfolders in a folder (including nested folders, nested folders of nested folders, and so on). The second one is the maximal number of files in a folder (including nested files in subfolders). Note that the disks are not regarded as folders.\nDemo input: ['C:\\\\folder1\\\\file1.txt', 'C:\\\\folder1\\\\folder2\\\\folder3\\\\file1.txt\\nC:\\\\folder1\\\\folder2\\\\folder4\\\\file1.txt\\nD:\\\\folder1\\\\file1.txt\\n', 'C:\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file.txt\\nC:\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file2\\\\file.txt'], Demo output: ['0 1', '3 2', '4 2']\nNote: In the first sample we have one folder on the \"C\" disk. It has no subfolders, which is why the first number in the answer is 0. But this folder contains one file, so the second number of the answer is 1.\n\nIn the second sample we have several different folders. Consider the \"folder1\" folder on the \"C\" disk. This folder directly contains one folder, \"folder2\". The \"folder2\" folder contains two more folders \u2014 \"folder3\" and \"folder4\". Thus, the \"folder1\" folder on the \"C\" drive has exactly 3 subfolders. Also this folder contains two files, even though they do not lie directly in the folder, but they are located in subfolders of \"folder1\".\n\nIn the third example we see that the names of some folders and some subfolders are identical. Consider the \"file\" folder, which lies directly on the \"C\" disk. That folder contains another \"file\" folder, which in turn contains another \"file\" folder, which contains two more folders, \"file\" and \"file2\". Thus, the \"file\" folder, which lies directly on the \"C\" disk, contains 4 subfolders."}]}}

For example, if *n*<==<=3, Sherlock's card is 123 and Moriarty's card has number 321, first Sherlock names 1 and Moriarty names 3 so Sherlock gets a flick. Then they both digit 2 so no one gets a flick. Finally, Sherlock names 3, while Moriarty names 1 and gets a flick.\n\nOf course, Sherlock will play honestly naming digits one by one in the order they are given, while Moriary, as a true villain, plans to cheat. He is going to name his digits in some other order (however, he is not going to change the overall number of occurences of each digit). For example, in case above Moriarty could name 1, 2, 3 and get no flicks at all, or he can name 2, 3 and 1 to give Sherlock two flicks.\n\nYour goal is to find out the minimum possible number of flicks Moriarty will get (no one likes flicks) and the maximum possible number of flicks Sherlock can get from Moriarty.

Bob is lucky to be the first finalist form Berland. But there is one problem: according to the rules of the competition, all participants must be at least 18 years old at the moment of the finals. Bob was born on *BD*.*BM*.*BY*. This date is recorded in his passport, the copy of which he has already mailed to the organizers. But Bob learned that in different countries the way, in which the dates are written, differs. For example, in the US the month is written first, then the day and finally the year.

If we split string *a* into two halves of the same size *a*1 and *a*2, and string *b* into two halves of the same size *b*1 and *b*2, then one of the following is correct:   *a*1 is equivalent to *b*1, and *a*2 is equivalent to *b*2 1.  *a*1 is equivalent to *b*2, and *a*2 is equivalent to *b*1 \nAs a home task, the teacher gave two strings to his students and asked to determine if they are equivalent.\n\nGerald has already completed this home task. Now it's your turn!\nInput specification: The first two lines of the input contain two strings given by the teacher. Each of them has the length from 1 to 200<=000 and consists of lowercase English letters. The strings have the same length.. Output specification: Print \"YES\" (without the quotes), if these two strings are equivalent, and \"NO\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\nDemo input: ['aaba\\nabaa\\n', 'aabb\\nabab\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: In the first sample you should split the first string into strings \"aa\" and \"ba\", the second one \u2014 into strings \"ab\" and \"aa\". \"aa\" is equivalent to \"aa\"; \"ab\" is equivalent to \"ba\" as \"ab\" = \"a\" + \"b\", \"ba\" = \"b\" + \"a\".\n\nIn the second sample the first string can be splitted into strings \"aa\" and \"bb\", that are equivalent only to themselves. That's why string \"aabb\" is equivalent only to itself and to string \"bbaa\"."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Nowadays, most of the internet advertisements are not statically linked to a web page. Instead, what will be shown to the person opening a web page is determined within 100 milliseconds after the web page is opened. Usually, multiple companies compete for each ad slot on the web page in an auction. Each of them receives a request with details about the user, web page and ad slot and they have to respond within those 100 milliseconds with a bid they would pay for putting an advertisement on that ad slot. The company that suggests the highest bid wins the auction and gets to place its advertisement. If there are several companies tied for the highest bid, the winner gets picked at random.\n\nHowever, the company that won the auction does not have to pay the exact amount of its bid. In most of the cases, a second-price auction is used. This means that the amount paid by the company is equal to the maximum of all the other bids placed for this ad slot.\n\nLet's consider one such bidding. There are *n* companies competing for placing an ad. The *i*-th of these companies will bid an integer number of microdollars equiprobably randomly chosen from the range between *L**i* and *R**i*, inclusive. In the other words, the value of the *i*-th company bid can be any integer from the range [*L**i*,<=*R**i*] with the same probability. \n\nDetermine the expected value that the winner will have to pay in a second-price auction.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains an integer number *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=5). *n* lines follow, the *i*-th of them containing two numbers *L**i* and *R**i* (1<=\u2264<=*L**i*<=\u2264<=*R**i*<=\u2264<=10000) describing the *i*-th company's bid preferences.\n\nThis problem doesn't have subproblems. You will get 8 points for the correct submission..

The first company bids a random integer number of microdollars in range [4,\u20097]; the second company bids between 8 and 10, and the third company bids 5 microdollars. The second company will win regardless of the exact value it bids, however the price it will pay depends on the value of first company's bid. With probability 0.5 the first company will bid at most 5 microdollars, and the second-highest price of the whole auction will be 5. With probability 0.25 it will bid 6 microdollars, and with probability 0.25 it will bid 7 microdollars.

Write a python script for the following problem: Petya has recently learned data structure named \"Binary heap\".\n\nThe heap he is now operating with allows the following operations: \n -  put the given number into the heap; -  get the value of the minimum element in the heap; -  extract the minimum element from the heap; \nThus, at any moment of time the heap contains several integers (possibly none), some of them might be equal.\n\nIn order to better learn this data structure Petya took an empty heap and applied some operations above to it. Also, he carefully wrote down all the operations and their results to his event log, following the format: \n -  insert *x*\u00a0\u2014 put the element with value *x* in the heap; -  getMin *x*\u00a0\u2014 the value of the minimum element contained in the heap was equal to *x*; -  removeMin\u00a0\u2014 the minimum element was extracted from the heap (only one instance, if there were many). \nAll the operations were correct, i.e. there was at least one element in the heap each time getMin or removeMin operations were applied.\n\nWhile Petya was away for a lunch, his little brother Vova came to the room, took away some of the pages from Petya's log and used them to make paper boats.\n\nNow Vova is worried, if he made Petya's sequence of operations inconsistent. For example, if one apply operations one-by-one in the order they are written in the event log, results of getMin operations might differ from the results recorded by Petya, and some of getMin or removeMin operations may be incorrect, as the heap is empty at the moment they are applied.\n\nNow Vova wants to add some new operation records to the event log in order to make the resulting sequence of operations correct. That is, the result of each getMin operation is equal to the result in the record, and the heap is non-empty when getMin ad removeMin are applied. Vova wants to complete this as fast as possible, as the Petya may get back at any moment. He asks you to add the least possible number of operation records to the current log. Note that arbitrary number of operations may be added at the beginning, between any two other operations, or at the end of the log.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains the only integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of the records left in Petya's journal.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines describe the records in the current log in the order they are applied. Format described in the statement is used. All numbers in the input are integers not exceeding 109 by their absolute value.. Output specification: The first line of the output should contain a single integer *m*\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible number of records in the modified sequence of operations.\n\nNext *m* lines should contain the corrected sequence of records following the format of the input (described in the statement), one per line and in the order they are applied. All the numbers in the output should be integers not exceeding 109 by their absolute value.\n\nNote that the input sequence of operations must be the subsequence of the output sequence.\n\nIt's guaranteed that there exists the correct answer consisting of no more than 1<=000<=000 operations.\nDemo input: ['2\\ninsert 3\\ngetMin 4\\n', '4\\ninsert 1\\ninsert 1\\nremoveMin\\ngetMin 2\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\ninsert 3\\nremoveMin\\ninsert 4\\ngetMin 4\\n', '6\\ninsert 1\\ninsert 1\\nremoveMin\\nremoveMin\\ninsert 2\\ngetMin 2\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, after number 3 is inserted into the heap, the minimum number is 3. To make the result of the first getMin equal to 4 one should firstly remove number 3 from the heap and then add number 4 into the heap.\n\nIn the second sample case number 1 is inserted two times, so should be similarly removed twice."}]}}

The way from home to school is represented by a segment of a straight line; the segment contains exactly *n*<=+<=1 bus stops. All of them are numbered with integers from 0 to *n* in the order in which they follow from Gerald's home.

Besides, Gerald's no idiot and he wouldn't get off the bus until it is still possible to ride on it closer to the school (obviously, getting off would be completely pointless). In other words, Gerald can get on the *i*-th bus on any stop numbered from *s**i* to *t**i*<=-<=1 inclusive, but he can get off the *i*-th bus only on the bus stop *t**i*.\n\nGerald can't walk between the bus stops and he also can't move in the direction from the school to the house.\n\nGerald wants to know how many ways he has to get from home to school.

Limak wants to maximize *X* secondarily so you should choose 42.\n\nIn more detail, after choosing *X*\u2009=\u200942 the process of building a tower is:\n -  Limak takes a block with side 3 because it's the biggest block with volume not greater than 42. The remaining volume is 42\u2009-\u200927\u2009=\u200915. -  The second added block has side 2, so the remaining volume is 15\u2009-\u20098\u2009=\u20097. -  Finally, Limak adds 7 blocks with side 1, one by one. \nSo, there are 9 blocks in the tower. The total volume is is 3<sup class=\"upper-index\">3</sup>\u2009+\u20092<sup class=\"upper-index\">3</sup>\u2009+\u20097\u00b71<sup class=\"upper-index\">3</sup>\u2009=\u200927\u2009+\u20098\u2009+\u20097\u2009=\u200942."}]}}

The new control element was delivered to the store recently and Artem immediately bought it.\n\nThat element can store information about the matrix of integers size *n*<=\u00d7<=*m*. There are *n*<=+<=*m* inputs in that element, i.e. each row and each column can get the signal. When signal comes to the input corresponding to some row, this row cyclically shifts to the left, that is the first element of the row becomes last element, second element becomes first and so on. When signal comes to the input corresponding to some column, that column shifts cyclically to the top, that is first element of the column becomes last element, second element becomes first and so on. Rows are numbered with integers from 1 to *n* from top to bottom, while columns are numbered with integers from 1 to *m* from left to right.\n\nArtem wants to carefully study this element before using it.

Write a python script for the following problem: There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: \n -  alloc n \u2014 to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; \nThe memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.\n\nThe first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.\nInput specification: The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100;1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *t* \u2014 the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* \u2014 the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.. Output specification: Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession. Output lines should go in the same order in which the operations are processed.

It says: \"each even number no less than four can be expressed as the sum of two primes\". Let's modify it. How about a statement like that: \"each integer no less than 12 can be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers.\" Not like the Goldbach's conjecture, I can prove this theorem.\n\nYou are given an integer *n* no less than 12, express it as a sum of two composite numbers.\nInput specification: The only line contains an integer *n* (12<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=106).. Output specification: Output two composite integers *x* and *y* (1<=&lt;<=*x*,<=*y*<=&lt;<=*n*) such that *x*<=+<=*y*<==<=*n*. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.\nDemo input: ['12\\n', '15\\n', '23\\n', '1000000\\n'], Demo output: ['4 8\\n', '6 9\\n', '8 15\\n', '500000 500000\\n']\nNote: In the first example, 12 = 4 + 8 and both 4, 8 are composite numbers. You can output \"6 6\" or \"8 4\" as well.\n\nIn the second example, 15 = 6 + 9. Note that you can't output \"1 14\" because 1 is not a composite number."}]}}

As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.\nInput specification: There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: For some time the program of rounding numbers that had been developed by the Codeforces participants during one of the previous rounds, helped the citizens of Far Far Away to convert numbers into a more easily readable format. However, as time went by, the economy of the Far Far Away developed and the scale of operations grew. So the King ordered to found the Bank of Far Far Away and very soon even the rounding didn't help to quickly determine even the order of the numbers involved in operations. Besides, rounding a number to an integer wasn't very convenient as a bank needed to operate with all numbers with accuracy of up to 0.01, and not up to an integer.\n\nThe King issued yet another order: to introduce financial format to represent numbers denoting amounts of money. The formal rules of storing a number in the financial format are as follows: \n -  A number contains the integer part and the fractional part. The two parts are separated with a character \".\" (decimal point). -  To make digits in the integer part of a number easier to read, they are split into groups of three digits, starting from the least significant ones. The groups are separated with the character \",\" (comma). For example, if the integer part of a number equals 12345678, then it will be stored in the financial format as 12,345,678 -  In the financial format a number's fractional part should contain exactly two digits. So, if the initial number (the number that is converted into the financial format) contains less than two digits in the fractional part (or contains no digits at all), it is complemented with zeros until its length equals 2. If the fractional part contains more than two digits, the extra digits are simply discarded (they are not rounded: see sample tests). -  When a number is stored in the financial format, the minus sign is not written. Instead, if the initial number had the minus sign, the result is written in round brackets. -  Please keep in mind that the bank of Far Far Away operates using an exotic foreign currency \u2014 snakes ($), that's why right before the number in the financial format we should put the sign \"$\". If the number should be written in the brackets, then the snake sign should also be inside the brackets. \nFor example, by the above given rules number 2012 will be stored in the financial format as \"$2,012.00\" and number -12345678.9 will be stored as \"($12,345,678.90)\".\n\nThe merchants of Far Far Away visited you again and expressed much hope that you supply them with the program that can convert arbitrary numbers to the financial format. Can you help them?\nInput specification: The input contains a number that needs to be converted into financial format. The number's notation length does not exceed 100 characters, including (possible) signs \"-\" (minus) and \".\" (decimal point). The number's notation is correct, that is: \n -  The number's notation only contains characters from the set {\"0\" \u2013 \"9\", \"-\", \".\"}. -  The decimal point (if it is present) is unique and is preceded and followed by a non-zero quantity on decimal digits -  A number cannot start with digit 0, except for a case when its whole integer part equals zero (in this case the integer parts is guaranteed to be a single zero: \"0\"). -  The minus sign (if it is present) is unique and stands in the very beginning of the number's notation -  If a number is identically equal to 0 (that is, if it is written as, for example, \"0\" or \"0.000\"), than it is not preceded by the minus sign. -  The input data contains no spaces. -  The number's notation contains at least one decimal digit.. Output specification: Print the number given in the input in the financial format by the rules described in the problem statement.\nDemo input: ['2012\\n', '0.000\\n', '-0.00987654321\\n', '-12345678.9\\n'], Demo output: ['$2,012.00', '$0.00', '($0.00)', '($12,345,678.90)']\nNote: Pay attention to the second and third sample tests. They show that the sign of a number in the financial format (and consequently, the presence or absence of brackets) is determined solely by the sign of the initial number. It does not depend on the sign of the number you got after translating the number to the financial format."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Manao works on a sports TV. He's spent much time watching the football games of some country. After a while he began to notice different patterns. For example, each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform and guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well. For each team the color of the home and guest uniform is different.\n\nThere are *n* teams taking part in the national championship. The championship consists of *n*\u00b7(*n*<=-<=1) games: each team invites each other team to its stadium. At this point Manao wondered: how many times during the championship is a host team going to put on the guest uniform? Note that the order of the games does not affect this number.\n\nYou know the colors of the home and guest uniform for each team. For simplicity, the colors are numbered by integers in such a way that no two distinct colors have the same number. Help Manao find the answer to his question.\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=30).

But Jack knows on what planet will Apophis land. In order to save his friends, Jack must repeatedly go through stargates to get to this planet.\n\nOverall the galaxy has *n* planets, indexed with numbers from 1 to *n*. Jack is on the planet with index 1, and Apophis will land on the planet with index *n*. Jack can move between some pairs of planets through stargates (he can move in both directions); the transfer takes a positive, and, perhaps, for different pairs of planets unequal number of seconds. Jack begins his journey at time 0.\n\nIt can be that other travellers are arriving to the planet where Jack is currently located. In this case, Jack has to wait for exactly 1 second before he can use the stargate. That is, if at time *t* another traveller arrives to the planet, Jack can only pass through the stargate at time *t*<=+<=1, unless there are more travellers arriving at time *t*<=+<=1 to the same planet.\n\nKnowing the information about travel times between the planets, and the times when Jack would not be able to use the stargate on particular planets, determine the minimum time in which he can get to the planet with index *n*.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers: *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105), the number of planets in the galaxy, and *m* (0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of pairs of planets between which Jack can travel using stargates.

If we split string *a* into two halves of the same size *a*1 and *a*2, and string *b* into two halves of the same size *b*1 and *b*2, then one of the following is correct:   *a*1 is equivalent to *b*1, and *a*2 is equivalent to *b*2 1.  *a*1 is equivalent to *b*2, and *a*2 is equivalent to *b*1 \nAs a home task, the teacher gave two strings to his students and asked to determine if they are equivalent.\n\nGerald has already completed this home task. Now it's your turn!\nInput specification: The first two lines of the input contain two strings given by the teacher. Each of them has the length from 1 to 200<=000 and consists of lowercase English letters. The strings have the same length.. Output specification: Print \"YES\" (without the quotes), if these two strings are equivalent, and \"NO\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\nDemo input: ['aaba\\nabaa\\n', 'aabb\\nabab\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: In the first sample you should split the first string into strings \"aa\" and \"ba\", the second one \u2014 into strings \"ab\" and \"aa\". \"aa\" is equivalent to \"aa\"; \"ab\" is equivalent to \"ba\" as \"ab\" = \"a\" + \"b\", \"ba\" = \"b\" + \"a\".\n\nIn the second sample the first string can be splitted into strings \"aa\" and \"bb\", that are equivalent only to themselves. That's why string \"aabb\" is equivalent only to itself and to string \"bbaa\"."}]}}

Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis.

Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*.

The education is not easy because you need to have fundamental knowledge in different areas, which sometimes are not related to each other. \n\nFor example, you should know linguistics very well. You learn a structure of Reberland language as foreign language. In this language words are constructed according to the following rules. First you need to choose the \"root\" of the word \u2014 some string which has more than 4 letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3 symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction \u2014  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row. All these strings are considered to be suffixes of the word (this time we use word \"suffix\" to describe a morpheme but not the few last characters of the string as you may used to). \n\nHere is one exercise that you have found in your task list. You are given the word *s*. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language. \n\nTwo strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match. \n\nLet's look at the example: the word *abacabaca* is given. This word can be obtained in the following ways: , where the root of the word is overlined, and suffixes are marked by \"corners\". Thus, the set of possible suffixes for this word is {*aca*,<=*ba*,<=*ca*}.\nInput specification: The only line contains a string *s* (5<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=104) consisting of lowercase English letters..

The length of the root equals 5, so no string can be used as a suffix."}]}}

Unfortunately, some tasks can have the same difficulty, so the order in which one can perform the tasks may vary.\n\nMenshykov, Uslada and Horace ask you to deal with this nuisance and come up with individual plans for each of them. The plan is a sequence describing the order in which an animal should do all the *n* tasks. Besides, each of them wants to have its own unique plan. Therefore three plans must form three different sequences. You are to find the required plans, or otherwise deliver the sad news to them by stating that it is impossible to come up with three distinct plans for the given tasks.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2000) \u2014 the number of tasks.

Unfortunately, author's solution of the original problem appeared wrong, so the problem was changed specially for the archive.\n\nOnce upon a time in a far away kingdom lived the King. The King had a beautiful daughter, Victoria. They lived happily, but not happily ever after: one day a vicious dragon attacked the kingdom and stole Victoria. The King was full of grief, yet he gathered his noble knights and promised half of his kingdom and Victoria's hand in marriage to the one who will save the girl from the infernal beast.\n\nHaving travelled for some time, the knights found the dragon's lair and all of them rushed there to save Victoria. Each knight spat on the dragon once and, as the dragon had quite a fragile and frail heart, his heart broke and poor beast died. As for the noble knights, they got Victoria right to the King and started brawling as each one wanted the girl's hand in marriage.\n\nThe problem was that all the noble knights were equally noble and equally handsome, and Victoria didn't want to marry any of them anyway. Then the King (and he was a very wise man and didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings) decided to find out who will get his daughter randomly, i.e. tossing a coin. However, there turned out to be *n* noble knights and the coin only has two sides. The good thing is that when a coin is tossed, the coin falls on each side with equal probability. The King got interested how to pick one noble knight using this coin so that all knights had equal probability of being chosen (the probability in that case should always be equal to 1<=/<=*n*). First the King wants to know the expected number of times he will need to toss a coin to determine the winner. Besides, while tossing the coin, the King should follow the optimal tossing strategy (i.e. the strategy that minimizes the expected number of tosses).

In order for the processing to be truly of high quality, the application must receive at least *k* photos with contrasts which differ as little as possible.\n\nEvlampiy already knows the contrast *v**i* for each of his *n* photos. Now he wants to split the photos into groups, so that each group contains at least *k* photos. As a result, each photo must belong to exactly one group.\n\nHe considers a processing time of the *j*-th group to be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of *v**i* in the group. Because of multithreading the processing time of a division into groups is the maximum processing time among all groups.\n\nSplit *n* photos into groups in a such way that the processing time of the division is the minimum possible, i.e. that the the maximum processing time over all groups as least as possible.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105) \u2014 number of photos and minimum size of a group.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *v*1,<=*v*2,<=...,<=*v**n* (1<=\u2264<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=109), where *v**i* is the contrast of the *i*-th photo.. Output specification: Print the minimal processing time of the division into groups.\nDemo input: ['5 2\\n50 110 130 40 120\\n', '4 1\\n2 3 4 1\\n'], Demo output: ['20\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: In the first example the photos should be split into 2 groups: [40,\u200950] and [110,\u2009120,\u2009130]. The processing time of the first group is 10, and the processing time of the second group is 20. Maximum among 10 and 20 is 20. It is impossible to split the photos into groups in a such way that the processing time of division is less than 20.\n\nIn the second example the photos should be split into four groups, each containing one photo. So the minimal possible processing time of a division is 0."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: A famous Berland's painter Kalevitch likes to shock the public. One of his last obsessions is chess. For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards.\n\nAs before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8<=\u00d7<=8 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke.\n\nKalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client's requirements.\n\nIt goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything \u2014 for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's needs. You are asked to help Kalevitch with this task.\nInput specification: The input file contains 8 lines, each of the lines contains 8 characters.

Write a python script for the following problem: By 2312 there were *n* Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*)..

Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.\n\nTournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\nInput specification: The only line of the input contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1018)\u00a0\u2014 the number of players to participate in the tournament.. Output specification: Print the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\nDemo input: ['2\\n', '3\\n', '4\\n', '10\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '2\\n', '2\\n', '4\\n']\nNote: In all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.\n\nIn the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.\n\nIn the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. \n\nIn the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1,\u20092) and (3,\u20094) and then clash the winners."}]}}

And, as the boy loves hockey very much, even more than physics, he forgot to do the homework. Specifically, he forgot to complete his physics tasks. Next day the teacher got very angry at Vasya and decided to teach him a lesson. He gave the lazy student a seemingly easy task: You are given an idle body in space and the forces that affect it. The body can be considered as a material point with coordinates (0; 0; 0). Vasya had only to answer whether it is in equilibrium. \"Piece of cake\" \u2014 thought Vasya, we need only to check if the sum of all vectors is equal to 0. So, Vasya began to solve the problem. But later it turned out that there can be lots and lots of these forces, and Vasya can not cope without your help. Help him.

The higher the rank of the soldier is, the better he fights. Therefore, the player profits from having the soldiers of the highest possible rank.\n\nTo increase the ranks of soldiers they need to train. But the soldiers won't train for free, and each training session requires one golden coin. On each training session all the *n* soldiers are present.\n\nAt the end of each training session the soldiers' ranks increase as follows. First all the soldiers are divided into groups with the same rank, so that the least possible number of groups is formed. Then, within each of the groups where the soldiers below the rank *k* are present, exactly one soldier increases his rank by one.\n\nYou know the ranks of all *n* soldiers at the moment. Determine the number of golden coins that are needed to increase the ranks of all the soldiers to the rank *k*.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=100). They represent the number of soldiers and the number of different ranks correspondingly. The second line contains *n* numbers in the non-decreasing order. The *i*-th of them, *a**i*, represents the rank of the *i*-th soldier in the defense building (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*, 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*k*).. Output specification: Print a single integer \u2014 the number of golden coins needed to raise all the soldiers to the maximal rank.\nDemo input: ['4 4\\n1 2 2 3\\n', '4 3\\n1 1 1 1\\n'], Demo output: ['4', '5']\nNote: In the first example the ranks will be raised in the following manner:\n\n1 2 2 3 \u2009\u2192\u2009 2 2 3 4 \u2009\u2192\u2009 2 3 4 4 \u2009\u2192\u2009 3 4 4 4 \u2009\u2192\u2009 4 4 4 4\n\nThus totals to 4 training sessions that require 4 golden coins."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Natasha is going to fly on a rocket to Mars and return to Earth. Also, on the way to Mars, she will land on $n - 2$ intermediate planets. Formally: we number all the planets from $1$ to $n$. $1$ is Earth, $n$ is Mars. Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt. Assume, that the rocket takes off and lands instantly.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 number of planets.\n\nThe second line contains the only integer $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 weight of the payload.\n\nThe third line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$), where $a_i$ is the number of tons, which can be lifted off by one ton of fuel.\n\nThe fourth line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le 1000$), where $b_i$ is the number of tons, which can be landed by one ton of fuel. \n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel..

Otherwise, print a single number $-1$.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel.\n\nThe answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $10^{-6}$. Formally, let your answer be $p$, and the jury's answer be $q$.

Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons.-  During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining.-  While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. There will be $14$ tons of rocket with fuel after that.-  During landing on Earth, one ton of fuel can land $7$ tons of cargo, so for landing $14$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight is $12$ tons, that is, a rocket without any fuel.\nIn the second case, the rocket will not be able even to take off from Earth."}]}}

Guests from all over the kingdom gather here to discuss new trends in the world of confectionery. Yet some of the things discussed here are not supposed to be disclosed to the general public: the information can cause discord in the kingdom of Sweetland in case it turns out to reach the wrong hands. So it's a necessity to not let any uninvited guests in.\n\nThere are 26 entrances in Jelly Castle, enumerated with uppercase English letters from A to Z. Because of security measures, each guest is known to be assigned an entrance he should enter the castle through. The door of each entrance is opened right before the first guest's arrival and closed right after the arrival of the last guest that should enter the castle through this entrance. No two guests can enter the castle simultaneously.\n\nFor an entrance to be protected from possible intrusion, a candy guard should be assigned to it. There are *k* such guards in the castle, so if there are more than *k* opened doors, one of them is going to be left unguarded! Notice that a guard can't leave his post until the door he is assigned to is closed.\n\nSlastyona had a suspicion that there could be uninvited guests at the evening. She knows the order in which the invited guests entered the castle, and wants you to help her check whether there was a moment when more than *k* doors were opened.\nInput specification: Two integers are given in the first string: the number of guests *n* and the number of guards *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=106, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=26).\n\nIn the second string, *n* uppercase English letters *s*1*s*2... *s**n* are given, where *s**i* is the entrance used by the *i*-th guest..

The door B is opened right before the arrival of the third guest, and closed after the fifth one arrives. One guard can handle both doors, as the first one is closed before the second one is opened.\n\nIn the second sample case, the door B is opened before the second guest's arrival, but the only guard can't leave the door A unattended, as there is still one more guest that should enter the castle through this door."}]}}

Sonya will give a number to each robot (they can be either same or different) and run them. When a robot is running, it is moving toward to another robot, reading numbers in the row. When a robot is reading a number that is equal to the number that was given to that robot, it will turn off and stay in the same position.\n\nSonya does not want robots to break, so she will give such numbers that robots will stop before they meet.

Employees of Pineapple did their best to postpone the release of Lastus 3000 as long as possible. Finally, they found out, that the name of the new artificial intelligence is similar to the name of the phone, that Pineapple released 200 years ago. As all rights on its name belong to Pineapple, they stand on changing the name of Gogol's artificial intelligence.\n\nPineapple insists, that the name of their phone occurs in the name of AI as a substring. Because the name of technology was already printed on all devices, the Gogol's director decided to replace some characters in AI name with \"#\". As this operation is pretty expensive, you should find the minimum number of characters to replace with \"#\", such that the name of AI doesn't contain the name of the phone as a substring.\n\nSubstring is a continuous subsequence of a string.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains the name of AI designed by Gogol, its length doesn't exceed 100<=000 characters. Second line contains the name of the phone released by Pineapple 200 years ago, its length doesn't exceed 30. Both string are non-empty and consist of only small English letters.. Output specification: Print the minimum number of characters that must be replaced with \"#\" in order to obtain that the name of the phone doesn't occur in the name of AI as a substring.\nDemo input: ['intellect\\ntell\\n', 'google\\napple\\n', 'sirisiri\\nsir\\n'], Demo output: ['1', '0', '2']\nNote: In the first sample AI's name may be replaced with \"int#llect\".\n\nIn the second sample Gogol can just keep things as they are.\n\nIn the third sample one of the new possible names of AI may be \"s#ris#ri\"."}]}}

Xenia is currently studying bit operations. To better understand how they work, Xenia decided to calculate some value *v* for *a*.\n\nNamely, it takes several iterations to calculate value *v*. At the first iteration, Xenia writes a new sequence *a*1\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*2,<=*a*3\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*4,<=...,<=*a*2*n*<=-<=1\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*2*n*, consisting of 2*n*<=-<=1 elements.

At the second iteration, Xenia writes the bitwise exclusive OR of adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the first iteration. At the third iteration Xenia writes the bitwise OR of the adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the second iteration.

Take the leftmost item with the left hand and spend *w**i*<=\u00b7<=*l* energy units (*w**i* is a weight of the leftmost item, *l* is some parameter).

A photographic rifle is obviously for Sharic who loves hunting and fish is for Matroskin, but for whom was a new video game console meant? Every one of the three friends claimed that the present is for him and nearly quarreled. Uncle Fyodor had an idea how to solve the problem justly: they should suppose that the console was sent to all three of them and play it in turns. Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up \u2014 who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that\u2019s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player wins.

First, the order in which the pies are to be handed out is decided. There is a special token called the \"decider\" token, initially held by Bob. Until all the pie is handed out, whoever has the decider token will give the next slice of pie to one of the participants, and the decider token to the other participant.
