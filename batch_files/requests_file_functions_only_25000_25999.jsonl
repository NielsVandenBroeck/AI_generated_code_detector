Write a python script for the following problem: Two polar bears Menshykov and Uslada from the St.Petersburg zoo and elephant Horace from the Kiev zoo got six sticks to play with and assess the animals' creativity. Menshykov, Uslada and Horace decided to make either an elephant or a bear from those sticks. They can make an animal from sticks in the following way: \n -  Four sticks represent the animal's legs, these sticks should have the same length. -  Two remaining sticks represent the animal's head and body. The bear's head stick must be shorter than the body stick. The elephant, however, has a long trunk, so his head stick must be as long as the body stick. Note that there are no limits on the relations between the leg sticks and the head and body sticks. \nYour task is to find out which animal can be made from the given stick set.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Felix the Robot is preparing for a probability theory exam. Unfortunately, during the semester, he took a course of the belles-lettres instead of studying the subject, so now he does not know the answer to any of the upcoming exam's questions. One thing is for sure: Felix needs help!\n\nThe exam for robots is an online event. It consists of *n*<==<=5000 questions each of which has only two possible answers: \"yes\" and \"no\". A robot can attempt to pass the exam at most *x*<==<=100 times. The questions, their order and right answers don't change from one attempt to another. Once the exam starts, Felix will get just a few seconds for all his attempts, and he can't learn the right answers so fast.\n\nThe robot will try to pass the exam in the following way. First, Felix fixes the answers for all questions. The result is a string of *n* bits: answers for the first, second, ..., *n*-th questions. In this string, 0 means that the answer is \"no\", and 1 is for \"yes\". Then he answers the questions according to this string, spending one attempt. After that, Felix can fix another string of *n* bits and make another attempt, and so on until there are no more attempts.\n\nIn the online system for exam, the following optimization is implemented: if at some moment of time, the examinee already got *k*<==<=2000 answers wrong, the attempt is immediately terminated with the corresponding message. For Felix, this means that the remaining bits in the string he fixed are ignored. If there were strictly less than *k* wrong answers for all *n* questions, the exam is considered passed.\n\nThe result of an attempt is a number from *k* to *n* inclusive: the number of questions after which the attempt was terminated. If the exam is passed, this number is considered to be *n*<=+<=1. The exam result is the highest result among all attempts. If there were no attempts, the exam result is zero.\n\nYour task is to write a program which will determine the bit strings for all attempts Felix makes. After each attempt, your program will get its result immediately. Help Felix get the highest exam result you can!\n\nInteraction Protocol\n\nYour solution can make from 0 to *x* attempts inclusive. To make an attempt, print a string to the standard output. The string must consist of exactly *n* binary digits without spaces and end with a newline character.\n\nTo prevent output buffering, after printing a string, insert a command to flush the buffer: for example, it can be fflush\u00a0(stdout) in C or C++, System.out.flush\u00a0() in Java, flush\u00a0(output) in Pascal or sys.stdout.flush\u00a0() in Python.\n\nAfter each attempt you make, you can immediately read its result from the standard input. The result is an integer from *k* to *n*<=+<=1 inclusive, followed by a newline character.\n\nScoring System\n\nA test is defined by a string of *n* binary digits: the right answers to *n* questions. This string is kept secret from the solution. Each test is evaluated separately.\n\nIf a solution followed the interaction protocol and terminated correctly on a test, it gets a score of *max* (0,<=*S*<=-<=4000) where *S* is the exam result. Otherwise, the solution gets zero score for the test.\n\nTesting\n\nYour solution will be checked on sets of tests generated in advance. Each test is created using a pseudo-random number generator. You can consider that the answers are uniformly distributed (the probabilities of digits 0 and 1 are the same) and mutually independent (the probabilities of all 2*n* possible strings are the same). A solution gets the score which is the sum of its score on all the tests.\n\nDuring the main phase of the contest, there are two ways to send a solution for checking.\n -  The first one is to check on examples. There are 10 example tests which are also available for local testing. As soon as the solution is checked, you can see reports for all examples by clicking on the submission result.-  The second way is to check on preliminary tests. There are 100 preliminary tests which are generated in advance but kept secret. The score for preliminary tests (but not for example tests) is used in the preliminary scoreboard. This score does not affect the final results, but nevertheless allows to roughly compare a solution with others. \nAfter the main phase ends, for each participant, the system chooses the final solution:\n -  consider all solutions sent for preliminary testing; -  choose the ones which got a total score strictly greater than zero; -  define the final solution as the one of chosen solutions which has the latest submission time. \nNote that the solutions sent only to be checked on examples are not considered when choosing the final solution.\n\nDuring the final testing, all final solutions will be checked on the same large set of a large number (<=\u2248<=1000) of final tests. The score for final tests determines the final scoreboard. The winner is the contestant whose solution gets the highest total score. In case two or more participants have equal total score, the contestants with such score tie for the same place.\n\nA package for local development is available on GitHub at the following address: [https://github.com/GassaFM/online-exam](https://github.com/GassaFM/online-exam). You can download sources or the latest release: [https://github.com/GassaFM/online-exam/releases](https://github.com/GassaFM/online-exam/releases).\n\nExample\n\nTo have an example which fits into the problem statement, let *n*<==<=10, *k*<==<=2, and *x*<==<=3 (recall that in the real problem, *n*<==<=5000, *k*<==<=2000, and *x*<==<=100, so this example is not a correct test for the problem). Let the right answers be defined by the string 1010001111. Before any attempts are made, the exam result is zero.\n\nConsider a solution making three attempts.\n\nLet the first attempt be defined by the string 0100100100. The result of this attempt is the number 2: the first wrong answer is the answer to the first question, and the second is to the second question. The exam result at this moment is 2.\n\nLet the second attempt be defined by the string 1010101010. The result of this attempt is the number 8: the first wrong answer is the answer to the fifth question, and the second is to the eighth question. The exam result at this moment is 8.\n\nLet the second attempt be defined by the string 1001011001. The result of this attempt is the number 4: the first wrong answer is the answer to the third question, and the second is to the fourth question. The exam result at this moment is still 8.\n\nAs *x*<==<=3 in our example, further attempts are impossible, so if the solution terminates correctly, the exam result is 8.\n\nNow consider another solution making two attempts.\n\nLet the first attempt be defined by the string 1010001110. Its result is the number 11: the first and only wrong answer is the answer to the tenth question, *k*<==<=2, so the exam is considered passed.\n\nLet the first attempt be defined by the string 0000011111. Its result is the number 3: the first wrong answer is the answer to the first question, and the second one is to the third question.\n\nIf the solution terminates correctly after the above two attempts, the exam result is 11.\nInput specification: none. Output specification: none\nDemo input: [], Demo output: []\nNote: none"}]}}

Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any *f* days from *n* next for sell-outs. On each of *f* chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on *i*-th day shop planned to put up for sale *k**i* products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7*k**i* products.

He has even invented a new variant of chess, which he named \u00abPawnChess\u00bb.\n\nThis new game is played on a board consisting of 8 rows and 8 columns. At the beginning of every game some black and white pawns are placed on the board. The number of black pawns placed is not necessarily equal to the number of white pawns placed. \n\nLets enumerate rows and columns with integers from 1 to 8. Rows are numbered from top to bottom, while columns are numbered from left to right. Now we denote as (*r*,<=*c*) the cell located at the row *r* and at the column *c*.\n\nThere are always two players A and B playing the game. Player A plays with white pawns, while player B plays with black ones. The goal of player A is to put any of his pawns to the row 1, while player B tries to put any of his pawns to the row 8. As soon as any of the players completes his goal the game finishes immediately and the succeeded player is declared a winner.\n\nPlayer A moves first and then they alternate turns. On his move player A must choose exactly one white pawn and move it one step upward and player B (at his turn) must choose exactly one black pawn and move it one step down. Any move is possible only if the targeted cell is empty. It's guaranteed that for any scenario of the game there will always be at least one move available for any of the players.\n\nMoving upward means that the pawn located in (*r*,<=*c*) will go to the cell (*r*<=-<=1,<=*c*), while moving down means the pawn located in (*r*,<=*c*) will go to the cell (*r*<=+<=1,<=*c*). Again, the corresponding cell must be empty, i.e. not occupied by any other pawn of any color.\n\nGiven the initial disposition of the board, determine who wins the game if both players play optimally. Note that there will always be a winner due to the restriction that for any game scenario both players will have some moves available.\nInput specification: The input consists of the board description given in eight lines, each line contains eight characters.

He labeled all these worms with consecutive integers: worms in first pile are labeled with numbers 1 to *a*1, worms in second pile are labeled with numbers *a*1<=+<=1 to *a*1<=+<=*a*2 and so on. See the example for a better understanding.\n\nMole can't eat all the worms (Marmot brought a lot) and, as we all know, Mole is blind, so Marmot tells him the labels of the best juicy worms. Marmot will only give Mole a worm if Mole says correctly in which pile this worm is contained.\n\nPoor Mole asks for your help. For all juicy worms said by Marmot, tell Mole the correct answers.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105), the number of piles.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=103, *a*1<=+<=*a*2<=+<=...<=+<=*a**n*<=\u2264<=106), where *a**i* is the number of worms in the *i*-th pile.\n\nThe third line contains single integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105), the number of juicy worms said by Marmot.\n\nThe fourth line contains *m* integers *q*1,<=*q*2,<=...,<=*q**m* (1<=\u2264<=*q**i*<=\u2264<=*a*1<=+<=*a*2<=+<=...<=+<=*a**n*), the labels of the juicy worms.. Output specification: Print *m* lines to the standard output. The *i*-th line should contain an integer, representing the number of the pile where the worm labeled with the number *q**i* is.\nDemo input: ['5\\n2 7 3 4 9\\n3\\n1 25 11\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n5\\n3\\n']\nNote: For the sample input:\n -  The worms with labels from [1, 2] are in the first pile. -  The worms with labels from [3, 9] are in the second pile. -  The worms with labels from [10, 12] are in the third pile. -  The worms with labels from [13, 16] are in the fourth pile. -  The worms with labels from [17, 25] are in the fifth pile."}]}}

They decided to be naughty and color the trees in the park. The trees are numbered with integers from 1 to *n* from left to right.\n\nInitially, tree *i* has color *c**i*. ZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon recognizes only *m* different colors, so 0<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=*m*, where *c**i*<==<=0 means that tree *i* is uncolored.\n\nZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon decides to color only the uncolored trees, i.e. the trees with *c**i*<==<=0. They can color each of them them in any of the *m* colors from 1 to *m*. Coloring the *i*-th tree with color *j* requires exactly *p**i*,<=*j* litres of paint.\n\nThe two friends define the beauty of a coloring of the trees as the minimum number of contiguous groups (each group contains some subsegment of trees) you can split all the *n* trees into so that each group contains trees of the same color. For example, if the colors of the trees from left to right are 2,<=1,<=1,<=1,<=3,<=2,<=2,<=3,<=1,<=3, the beauty of the coloring is 7, since we can partition the trees into 7 contiguous groups of the same color : {2},<={1,<=1,<=1},<={3},<={2,<=2},<={3},<={1},<={3}. \n\nZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon wants to color all uncolored trees so that the beauty of the coloring is exactly *k*.

Note that 1,\u20091,\u20091 would not be valid because the beauty of such coloring equals to 1 ({1,\u20091,\u20091} is a way to group the trees into a single group of the same color).\n\nIn the second sample case, all the trees are colored, but the beauty of the coloring is 3, so there is no valid coloring, and the answer is \u2009-\u20091.\n\nIn the last sample case, all the trees are colored and the beauty of the coloring matches *k*, so no paint is used and the answer is 0."}]}}

Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up \u2014 who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple.

There's no surprise that you slept in this morning and were late for the tournament (it was a weekend, after all). Now you are really curious about the results of the tournament. This time the tournament in Berland went as follows:\n -  There are *n* knights participating in the tournament. Each knight was assigned his unique number \u2014 an integer from 1 to *n*. -  The tournament consisted of *m* fights, in the *i*-th fight the knights that were still in the game with numbers at least *l**i* and at most *r**i* have fought for the right to continue taking part in the tournament. -  After the *i*-th fight among all participants of the fight only one knight won \u2014 the knight number *x**i*, he continued participating in the tournament. Other knights left the tournament. -  The winner of the last (the *m*-th) fight (the knight number *x**m*) became the winner of the tournament. \nYou fished out all the information about the fights from your friends.

The Little Elephant and his friend know that a proper chessboard doesn't have any side-adjacent cells with the same color and the upper left cell is white.

The segments can be either vertical or horizontal. -  Then Inna makes multiple moves. In a single move, Inna can paint a segment of any length on the plane, she chooses its type at the beginning of the game (either vertical or horizontal), then all alarm clocks that are on this segment switch off.

So the sequence of numbers written on the cubes in the order from the left to the right equals to *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*.\n\nWhile Vasya was walking, his little brother Stepan played with Vasya's cubes and changed their order, so now the sequence of numbers written on the cubes became equal to *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**n*. \n\nStepan said that he swapped only cubes which where on the positions between *l* and *r*, inclusive, and did not remove or add any other cubes (i. e. he said that he reordered cubes between positions *l* and *r*, inclusive, in some way).\n\nYour task is to determine if it is possible that Stepan said the truth, or it is guaranteed that Stepan deceived his brother.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *l*, *r* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=*r*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of Vasya's cubes and the positions told by Stepan.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the sequence of integers written on cubes in the Vasya's order.\n\nThe third line contains the sequence *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**n* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the sequence of integers written on cubes after Stepan rearranged their order.\n\nIt is guaranteed that Stepan did not remove or add other cubes, he only rearranged Vasya's cubes.. Output specification: Print \"LIE\" (without quotes) if it is guaranteed that Stepan deceived his brother. In the other case, print \"TRUTH\" (without quotes).\nDemo input: ['5 2 4\\n3 4 2 3 1\\n3 2 3 4 1\\n', '3 1 2\\n1 2 3\\n3 1 2\\n', '4 2 4\\n1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1\\n'], Demo output: ['TRUTH\\n', 'LIE\\n', 'TRUTH\\n']\nNote: In the first example there is a situation when Stepan said the truth. Initially the sequence of integers on the cubes was equal to [3, 4, 2, 3, 1]. Stepan could at first swap cubes on positions 2 and 3 (after that the sequence of integers on cubes became equal to [3, 2, 4, 3, 1]), and then swap cubes in positions 3 and 4 (after that the sequence of integers on cubes became equal to [3, 2, 3, 4, 1]).\n\nIn the second example it is not possible that Stepan said truth because he said that he swapped cubes only between positions 1 and 2, but we can see that it is guaranteed that he changed the position of the cube which was on the position 3 at first. So it is guaranteed that Stepan deceived his brother.\n\nIn the third example for any values *l* and *r* there is a situation when Stepan said the truth."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: \n -  alloc n \u2014 to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; \nThe memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.\n\nThe first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.\nInput specification: The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100;1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *t* \u2014 the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* \u2014 the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.. Output specification: Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession. Output lines should go in the same order in which the operations are processed.

For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\n\nVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads \u2014 major and minor.\n\nLet's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes *X*, *Y* and *Z*. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between *X* and *Y* equals 4 semitones and the distance between *Y* and *Z* is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between *X* and *Z*, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.\n\nA minor triad is different in that the distance between *X* and *Y* should be 3 semitones and between *Y* and *Z* \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nFor example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nHelp Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\nInput specification: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.. Output specification: Print \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\nDemo input: ['C E G\\n', 'C# B F\\n', 'A B H\\n'], Demo output: ['major\\n', 'minor\\n', 'strange\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Little Petya is learning to play chess. He has already learned how to move a king, a rook and a bishop. Let us remind you the rules of moving chess pieces. A chessboard is 64 square fields organized into an 8<=\u00d7<=8 table. A field is represented by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*) \u2014 the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:\n -  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically. -  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally. -  A king moves one field in any direction \u2014 horizontally, vertically or diagonally. \nPetya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2)? At that, we assume that there are no more pieces besides this one on the board. Help him solve this problem.\nInput specification: The input contains four integers *r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2 (1<=\u2264<=*r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2<=\u2264<=8) \u2014 the coordinates of the starting and the final field.

Output specification: Print three space-separated integers: the minimum number of moves the rook, the bishop and the king (in this order) is needed to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2). If a piece cannot make such a move, print a 0 instead of the corresponding number.\nDemo input: ['4 3 1 6\\n', '5 5 5 6\\n'], Demo output: ['2 1 3\\n', '1 0 1\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: A boy Petya loves chess very much. He even came up with a chess piece of his own, a semiknight. The semiknight can move in any of these four directions: 2 squares forward and 2 squares to the right, 2 squares forward and 2 squares to the left, 2 squares backward and 2 to the right and 2 squares backward and 2 to the left. Naturally, the semiknight cannot move beyond the limits of the chessboard.\n\nPetya put two semiknights on a standard chessboard. Petya simultaneously moves with both semiknights. The squares are rather large, so after some move the semiknights can meet, that is, they can end up in the same square. After the meeting the semiknights can move on, so it is possible that they meet again. Petya wonders if there is such sequence of moves when the semiknights meet. Petya considers some squares bad. That is, they do not suit for the meeting. The semiknights can move through these squares but their meetings in these squares don't count.\n\nPetya prepared multiple chess boards.

Write a python script for the following problem: Merge sort is a well-known sorting algorithm. The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:\n 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=\u2264<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* \u2014 *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\nInput specification: The first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it.. Output specification: If a permutation of size *n* such that there will be exactly *k* calls of *mergesort* while sorting it doesn't exist, output <=-<=1. Otherwise output *n* integer numbers *a*[0],<=*a*[1],<=...,<=*a*[*n*<=-<=1] \u2014 the elements of a permutation that would meet the required conditions.

The Little Elephant and his friend know that a proper chessboard doesn't have any side-adjacent cells with the same color and the upper left cell is white.

But they should have equal ratings to be allowed to compose a single team consisting of all *n* friends. So the friends are faced with the problem: how to make all their ratings equal.\n\nOne way to change ratings is to willingly lose in some matches. Friends can form a party consisting of two to five (but not more than *n*) friends and play a match in the game. When the party loses, the rating of each of its members decreases by 1. A rating can't become negative, so *r**i*<==<=0 doesn't change after losing.\n\nThe friends can take part in multiple matches, each time making a party from any subset of friends (but remember about constraints on party size: from 2 to 5 members).\n\nThe friends want to make their ratings equal but as high as possible.\n\nHelp the friends develop a strategy of losing the matches so that all their ratings become equal and the resulting rating is maximum possible.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of friends.\n\nThe second line contains *n* non-negative integers *r*1,<=*r*2,<=...,<=*r**n* (0<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=100), where *r**i* is the initial rating of the *i*-th friend..

Besides, Vova has several splitters.\n\nA splitter is a construction that consists of one input (it can be connected to a water pipe) and *x* output pipes. When a splitter is connected to a water pipe, water flows from each output pipe. You can assume that the output pipes are ordinary pipes. For example, you can connect water supply to such pipe if there's water flowing out from it. At most one splitter can be connected to any water pipe.\n\nVova has one splitter of each kind: with 2, 3, 4, ..., *k* outputs. Help Vova use the minimum number of splitters to build the required pipeline or otherwise state that it's impossible.\n\nVova needs the pipeline to have exactly *n* pipes with flowing out water. Note that some of those pipes can be the output pipes of the splitters.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1018, 2<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=109).\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.. Output specification: Print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of splitters needed to build the pipeline.

If at the end of the game there is only one player with the maximum number of points, he is the winner. The situation becomes more difficult if the number of such players is more than one. During each round a player gains or loses a particular number of points. In the course of the game the number of points is registered in the line \"name score\", where name is a player's name, and score is the number of points gained in this round, which is an integer number. If score is negative, this means that the player has lost in the round. So, if two or more players have the maximum number of points (say, it equals to *m*) at the end of the game, than wins the one of them who scored at least *m* points first.

If the bone happens to be at the position where there is a hole at any time, it will fall into the hole onto the ground and will not be affected by future swapping operations.\n\nDo not forget that Zane is a wizard. When he swaps the cups, he does not move them ordinarily. Instead, he teleports the cups (along with the bone, if it is inside) to the intended positions.

Petya immediately offered Masha to play the game with him.\n\nBefore the very beginning of the game several cards are lain out on a table in one line from the left to the right. Each card contains a digit: 0 or 1. Players move in turns and Masha moves first. During each move a player should remove a card from the table and shift all other cards so as to close the gap left by the removed card. For example, if before somebody's move the cards on the table formed a sequence 01010101, then after the fourth card is removed (the cards are numbered starting from 1), the sequence will look like that: 0100101. \n\nThe game ends when exactly two cards are left on the table. The digits on these cards determine the number in binary notation: the most significant bit is located to the left. Masha's aim is to minimize the number and Petya's aim is to maximize it.\n\nAn unpleasant accident occurred before the game started. The kids spilled juice on some of the cards and the digits on the cards got blurred. Each one of the spoiled cards could have either 0 or 1 written on it. Consider all possible variants of initial arrangement of the digits (before the juice spilling). For each variant, let's find which two cards are left by the end of the game, assuming that both Petya and Masha play optimally.

Your task is to find the set of outcomes for all variants of initial digits arrangement.\nInput specification: The first line contains a sequence of characters each of which can either be a \"0\", a \"1\" or a \"?\". This sequence determines the initial arrangement of cards on the table from the left to the right. The characters \"?\" mean that the given card was spoiled before the game. The sequence's length ranges from 2 to 105, inclusive.. Output specification: Print the set of outcomes for all possible initial digits arrangements. Print each possible outcome on a single line. Each outcome should be represented by two characters: the digits written on the cards that were left by the end of the game.

For the variant 0000 the outcome is 00. For the variant 1111 the outcome is 11. For the variant 0011 the outcome is 01. For the variant 1100 the outcome is 10. Regardless of outcomes for all other variants the set which we are looking for will contain all 4 possible outcomes.\n\nIn the third sample only 2 variants of numbers arrangement are possible: 111 and 101.

In order to carry out his plan, he needs to take exactly *k* consecutive planks from the fence. Higher planks are harder to tear off the fence, so Polycarpus wants to find such *k* consecutive planks that the sum of their heights is minimal possible.\n\nWrite the program that finds the indexes of *k* consecutive planks with minimal total height. Pay attention, the fence is not around Polycarpus's home, it is in front of home (in other words, the fence isn't cyclic).\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1.5\u00b7105,<=1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of planks in the fence and the width of the hole for the piano.

Output specification: Print such integer *j* that the sum of the heights of planks *j*, *j*<=+<=1, ..., *j*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1 is the minimum possible. If there are multiple such *j*'s, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['7 3\\n1 2 6 1 1 7 1\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n']\nNote: In the sample, your task is to find three consecutive planks with the minimum sum of heights.

Write a python script for the following problem: In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.\n\nThere are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.\n\nOfficer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:\n -  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$; -  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. \nFor example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\n\nThe structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.\n\nFormally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.\n\nBerland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.\n\nSuppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ \u2014 one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.\n\nLet's look at the following example:\n\nIf officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.\n\nIf officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.\n\nTo answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.\n\nYou should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i &lt; i$), where $p_i$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $i$. The commander has index $1$ and doesn't have any superiors.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query is given as a pair ($u_i, k_i$) ($1 \\le u_i, k_i \\le n$), where $u_i$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $k_i$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence.. Output specification: Print $q$ numbers, where the $i$-th number is the officer at the position $k_i$ in the list which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if it starts spreading from officer $u_i$. Print \"-1\" if the number of officers which receive the command is less than $k_i$.\n\nYou should process queries independently. They do not affect each other.\nDemo input: ['9 6\\n1 1 1 3 5 3 5 7\\n3 1\\n1 5\\n3 4\\n7 3\\n1 8\\n1 9\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n6\\n8\\n-1\\n9\\n4\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Fortunately, the robot recorded its own movements correctly. Now Draude wants to find out when his robot functions wrong. Heh, if Draude only remembered the map of the field, where he tested the robot, he would easily say if the robot walked in the right direction or not. But the field map was lost never to be found, that's why he asks you to find out if there exist at least one map, where the path recorded by the robot is the shortest.\n\nThe map is an infinite checkered field, where each square is either empty, or contains an obstruction.

He was in such a hurry to launch it for the first time that he plugged in the power wires without giving it a proper glance and started experimenting right away. After a while Mike observed that the wires ended up entangled and now have to be untangled again.\n\nThe device is powered by two wires \"plus\" and \"minus\". The wires run along the floor from the wall (on the left) to the device (on the right). Both the wall and the device have two contacts in them on the same level, into which the wires are plugged in some order. The wires are considered entangled if there are one or more places where one wire runs above the other one. For example, the picture below has four such places (top view):\n\nMike knows the sequence in which the wires run above each other. Mike also noticed that on the left side, the \"plus\" wire is always plugged into the top contact (as seen on the picture). He would like to untangle the wires without unplugging them and without moving the device. Determine if it is possible to do that. A wire can be freely moved and stretched on the floor, but cannot be cut.\n\nTo understand the problem better please read the notes to the test samples.\nInput specification: The single line of the input contains a sequence of characters \"+\" and \"-\" of length *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000).

To untangle the wires, one can first move the \"plus\" wire lower, thus eliminating the two crosses in the middle, and then draw it under the \"minus\" wire, eliminating also the remaining two crosses.\n\nIn the second testcase the \"plus\" wire makes one full revolution around the \"minus\" wire. Thus the wires cannot be untangled: \n\nIn the third testcase the \"plus\" wire simply runs above the \"minus\" wire twice in sequence. The wires can be untangled by lifting \"plus\" and moving it higher: \n\nIn the fourth testcase the \"minus\" wire runs above the \"plus\" wire once.

Specifically, you need to determine which employees should come to the party, and which should not, so after all the visitors send messages to their contacts, each employee received a number of messages that is different from what Igor stated.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of employees of company Looksery.\n\nNext *n* lines contain the description of the contact lists of the employees. The *i*-th of these lines contains a string of length *n*, consisting of digits zero and one, specifying the contact list of the *i*-th employee. If the *j*-th character of the *i*-th string equals 1, then the *j*-th employee is in the *i*-th employee's contact list, otherwise he isn't. It is guaranteed that the *i*-th character of the *i*-th line is always equal to 1.\n\nThe last line contains *n* space-separated integers: *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*), where *a**i* represents the number of messages that the *i*-th employee should get according to Igor.. Output specification: In the first line print a single integer *m* \u2014 the number of employees who should come to the party so that Igor loses the dispute.\n\nIn the second line print *m* space-separated integers \u2014 the numbers of these employees in an arbitrary order.\n\nIf Igor wins the dispute in any case, print -1.\n\nIf there are multiple possible solutions, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['3\\n101\\n010\\n001\\n0 1 2\\n', '1\\n1\\n1\\n', '4\\n1111\\n0101\\n1110\\n0001\\n1 0 1 0\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n1 \\n', '0\\n\\n', '4\\n1 2 3 4 \\n']\nNote: In the first sample Igor supposes that the first employee will receive 0 messages. Since he isn't contained in any other contact list he must come to the party in order to receive one message from himself. If he is the only who come to the party then he will receive 1 message, the second employee will receive 0 messages and the third will also receive 1 message. Thereby Igor won't guess any number.\n\nIn the second sample if the single employee comes to the party he receives 1 message and Igor wins, so he shouldn't do it.\n\nIn the third sample the first employee will receive 2 messages, the second \u2014 3, the third \u2014 2, the fourth \u2014 3."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Mahmoud was trying to solve the vertex cover problem on trees. The problem statement is:\n\nGiven an undirected tree consisting of *n* nodes, find the minimum number of vertices that cover all the edges. Formally, we need to find a set of vertices such that for each edge (*u*,<=*v*) that belongs to the tree, either *u* is in the set, or *v* is in the set, or both are in the set. Mahmoud has found the following algorithm:\n -  Root the tree at node 1. -  Count the number of nodes at an even depth. Let it be *evenCnt*. -  Count the number of nodes at an odd depth. Let it be *oddCnt*. -  The answer is the minimum between *evenCnt* and *oddCnt*. \nThe depth of a node in a tree is the number of edges in the shortest path between this node and the root. The depth of the root is 0.\n\nEhab told Mahmoud that this algorithm is wrong, but he didn't believe because he had tested his algorithm against many trees and it worked, so Ehab asked you to find 2 trees consisting of *n* nodes. The algorithm should find an incorrect answer for the first tree and a correct answer for the second one.\nInput specification: The only line contains an integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105), the number of nodes in the desired trees.. Output specification: The output should consist of 2 independent sections, each containing a tree. The algorithm should find an incorrect answer for the tree in the first section and a correct answer for the tree in the second. If a tree doesn't exist for some section, output \"-1\" (without quotes) for that section only.\n\nIf the answer for a section exists, it should contain *n*<=-<=1 lines, each containing 2 space-separated integers *u* and *v* (1<=\u2264<=*u*,<=*v*<=\u2264<=*n*), which means that there's an undirected edge between node *u* and node *v*. If the given graph isn't a tree or it doesn't follow the format, you'll receive wrong answer verdict.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\nDemo input: ['2\\n', '8\\n'], Demo output: ['-1\\n1 2\\n', '1 2\\n1 3\\n2 4\\n2 5\\n3 6\\n4 7\\n4 8\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n2 4\\n2 5\\n2 6\\n3 7\\n6 8']\nNote: In the first sample, there is only 1 tree with 2 nodes (node 1 connected to node 2). The algorithm will produce a correct answer in it so we printed \u2009-\u20091 in the first section, but notice that we printed this tree in the second section.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\nIn the first tree, the algorithm will find an answer with 4 nodes, while there exists an answer with 3 nodes like this: <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/fb4efe76f0a74395fe77f22da2dbd2a3340f8b2a.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> In the second tree, the algorithm will find an answer with 3 nodes which is correct: <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/700db299c05ae94849f44b93e8240d375a0fe05f.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>"}]}}

In order to verify this, Petya needs to know whether there exists a string *s*, such that if Vasya used this *s* he would produce the given graph *G*.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* \u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices and edges in the graph found by Petya, respectively.\n\nEach of the next *m* lines contains two integers *u**i* and *v**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*u**i*<=\u2260<=*v**i*)\u00a0\u2014 the edges of the graph *G*. It is guaranteed, that there are no multiple edges, that is any pair of vertexes appear in this list no more than once.. Output specification: In the first line print \"Yes\" (without the quotes), if the string *s* Petya is interested in really exists and \"No\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\n\nIf the string *s* exists, then print it on the second line of the output. The length of *s* must be exactly *n*, it must consist of only letters \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\" only, and the graph built using this string must coincide with *G*. If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.\nDemo input: ['2 1\\n1 2\\n', '4 3\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n1 4\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\naa\\n', 'No\\n']\nNote: In the first sample you are given a graph made of two vertices with an edge between them. So, these vertices can correspond to both the same and adjacent letters. Any of the following strings \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"bb\", \"bc\", \"cb\", \"cc\" meets the graph's conditions. \n\nIn the second sample the first vertex is connected to all three other vertices, but these three vertices are not connected with each other. That means that they must correspond to distinct letters that are not adjacent, but that is impossible as there are only two such letters: a and c."}]}}

Having learned the news, the colonel ordered to all *n* squad soldiers to line up on the parade ground.\n\nBy the military charter the soldiers should stand in the order of non-increasing of their height. But as there's virtually no time to do that, the soldiers lined up in the arbitrary order. However, the general is rather short-sighted and he thinks that the soldiers lined up correctly if the first soldier in the line has the maximum height and the last soldier has the minimum height. Please note that the way other solders are positioned does not matter, including the case when there are several soldiers whose height is maximum or minimum. Only the heights of the first and the last soldier are important.\n\nFor example, the general considers the sequence of heights (4, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1) correct and the sequence (4, 3, 1, 2, 2) wrong.\n\nWithin one second the colonel can swap any two neighboring soldiers.

But the interval (1,<=2) is correct because it doesn't contain any foe pair.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105) \u2014 the length of the permutation *p* and the number of foe pairs.\n\nThe second line contains *n* distinct integers *p**i* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the elements of the permutation *p*.\n\nEach of the next *m* lines contains two integers (*a**i*,<=*b**i*) (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*a**i*<=\u2260<=*b**i*) \u2014 the *i*-th foe pair. Note a foe pair can appear multiple times in the given list.. Output specification: Print the only integer *c* \u2014 the number of different intervals (*x*,<=*y*) that does not contain any foe pairs.\n\nNote that the answer can be too large, so you should use 64-bit integer type to store it. In C++ you can use the long long integer type and in Java you can use long integer type.\nDemo input: ['4 2\\n1 3 2 4\\n3 2\\n2 4\\n', '9 5\\n9 7 2 3 1 4 6 5 8\\n1 6\\n4 5\\n2 7\\n7 2\\n2 7\\n'], Demo output: ['5\\n', '20\\n']\nNote: In the first example the intervals from the answer are (1,\u20091), (1,\u20092), (2,\u20092), (3,\u20093) and (4,\u20094)."}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: For some time the program of rounding numbers that had been developed by the Codeforces participants during one of the previous rounds, helped the citizens of Far Far Away to convert numbers into a more easily readable format. However, as time went by, the economy of the Far Far Away developed and the scale of operations grew. So the King ordered to found the Bank of Far Far Away and very soon even the rounding didn't help to quickly determine even the order of the numbers involved in operations. Besides, rounding a number to an integer wasn't very convenient as a bank needed to operate with all numbers with accuracy of up to 0.01, and not up to an integer.\n\nThe King issued yet another order: to introduce financial format to represent numbers denoting amounts of money. The formal rules of storing a number in the financial format are as follows: \n -  A number contains the integer part and the fractional part. The two parts are separated with a character \".\" (decimal point). -  To make digits in the integer part of a number easier to read, they are split into groups of three digits, starting from the least significant ones. The groups are separated with the character \",\" (comma). For example, if the integer part of a number equals 12345678, then it will be stored in the financial format as 12,345,678 -  In the financial format a number's fractional part should contain exactly two digits. So, if the initial number (the number that is converted into the financial format) contains less than two digits in the fractional part (or contains no digits at all), it is complemented with zeros until its length equals 2. If the fractional part contains more than two digits, the extra digits are simply discarded (they are not rounded: see sample tests). -  When a number is stored in the financial format, the minus sign is not written. Instead, if the initial number had the minus sign, the result is written in round brackets. -  Please keep in mind that the bank of Far Far Away operates using an exotic foreign currency \u2014 snakes ($), that's why right before the number in the financial format we should put the sign \"$\". If the number should be written in the brackets, then the snake sign should also be inside the brackets. \nFor example, by the above given rules number 2012 will be stored in the financial format as \"$2,012.00\" and number -12345678.9 will be stored as \"($12,345,678.90)\".\n\nThe merchants of Far Far Away visited you again and expressed much hope that you supply them with the program that can convert arbitrary numbers to the financial format. Can you help them?\nInput specification: The input contains a number that needs to be converted into financial format. The number's notation length does not exceed 100 characters, including (possible) signs \"-\" (minus) and \".\" (decimal point). The number's notation is correct, that is: \n -  The number's notation only contains characters from the set {\"0\" \u2013 \"9\", \"-\", \".\"}. -  The decimal point (if it is present) is unique and is preceded and followed by a non-zero quantity on decimal digits -  A number cannot start with digit 0, except for a case when its whole integer part equals zero (in this case the integer parts is guaranteed to be a single zero: \"0\"). -  The minus sign (if it is present) is unique and stands in the very beginning of the number's notation -  If a number is identically equal to 0 (that is, if it is written as, for example, \"0\" or \"0.000\"), than it is not preceded by the minus sign. -  The input data contains no spaces. -  The number's notation contains at least one decimal digit.. Output specification: Print the number given in the input in the financial format by the rules described in the problem statement.\nDemo input: ['2012\\n', '0.000\\n', '-0.00987654321\\n', '-12345678.9\\n'], Demo output: ['$2,012.00', '$0.00', '($0.00)', '($12,345,678.90)']\nNote: Pay attention to the second and third sample tests. They show that the sign of a number in the financial format (and consequently, the presence or absence of brackets) is determined solely by the sign of the initial number. It does not depend on the sign of the number you got after translating the number to the financial format."}]}}

In this game there are three identical cups arranged in a line from left to right. Initially key to Barney's heart is under the middle cup.\n\nThen at one turn Barney swaps the cup in the middle with any of other two cups randomly (he choses each with equal probability), so the chosen cup becomes the middle one. Game lasts *n* turns and Barney independently choses a cup to swap with the middle one within each turn, and the key always remains in the cup it was at the start.\n\nAfter *n*-th turn Barney asks a girl to guess which cup contains the key.

Write a python script for the following problem: Petya has recently learned data structure named \"Binary heap\".\n\nThe heap he is now operating with allows the following operations: \n -  put the given number into the heap; -  get the value of the minimum element in the heap; -  extract the minimum element from the heap; \nThus, at any moment of time the heap contains several integers (possibly none), some of them might be equal.\n\nIn order to better learn this data structure Petya took an empty heap and applied some operations above to it. Also, he carefully wrote down all the operations and their results to his event log, following the format: \n -  insert *x*\u00a0\u2014 put the element with value *x* in the heap; -  getMin *x*\u00a0\u2014 the value of the minimum element contained in the heap was equal to *x*; -  removeMin\u00a0\u2014 the minimum element was extracted from the heap (only one instance, if there were many). \nAll the operations were correct, i.e. there was at least one element in the heap each time getMin or removeMin operations were applied.\n\nWhile Petya was away for a lunch, his little brother Vova came to the room, took away some of the pages from Petya's log and used them to make paper boats.\n\nNow Vova is worried, if he made Petya's sequence of operations inconsistent. For example, if one apply operations one-by-one in the order they are written in the event log, results of getMin operations might differ from the results recorded by Petya, and some of getMin or removeMin operations may be incorrect, as the heap is empty at the moment they are applied.\n\nNow Vova wants to add some new operation records to the event log in order to make the resulting sequence of operations correct. That is, the result of each getMin operation is equal to the result in the record, and the heap is non-empty when getMin ad removeMin are applied. Vova wants to complete this as fast as possible, as the Petya may get back at any moment. He asks you to add the least possible number of operation records to the current log. Note that arbitrary number of operations may be added at the beginning, between any two other operations, or at the end of the log.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains the only integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of the records left in Petya's journal.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines describe the records in the current log in the order they are applied.

Output specification: The first line of the output should contain a single integer *m*\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible number of records in the modified sequence of operations.\n\nNext *m* lines should contain the corrected sequence of records following the format of the input (described in the statement), one per line and in the order they are applied. All the numbers in the output should be integers not exceeding 109 by their absolute value.\n\nNote that the input sequence of operations must be the subsequence of the output sequence.\n\nIt's guaranteed that there exists the correct answer consisting of no more than 1<=000<=000 operations.\nDemo input: ['2\\ninsert 3\\ngetMin 4\\n', '4\\ninsert 1\\ninsert 1\\nremoveMin\\ngetMin 2\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\ninsert 3\\nremoveMin\\ninsert 4\\ngetMin 4\\n', '6\\ninsert 1\\ninsert 1\\nremoveMin\\nremoveMin\\ninsert 2\\ngetMin 2\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, after number 3 is inserted into the heap, the minimum number is 3. To make the result of the first getMin equal to 4 one should firstly remove number 3 from the heap and then add number 4 into the heap.\n\nIn the second sample case number 1 is inserted two times, so should be similarly removed twice."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: The heat during the last few days has been really intense. Scientists from all over the Berland study how the temperatures and weather change, and they claim that this summer is abnormally hot. But any scientific claim sounds a lot more reasonable if there are some numbers involved, so they have decided to actually calculate some value which would represent how high the temperatures are.\n\nMathematicians of Berland State University came up with a special heat intensity value. This value is calculated as follows:\n\nSuppose we want to analyze the segment of $n$ consecutive days. We have measured the temperatures during these $n$ days; the temperature during $i$-th day equals $a_i$.\n\nWe denote the average temperature of a segment of some consecutive days as the arithmetic mean of the temperature measures during this segment of days. So, if we want to analyze the average temperature from day $x$ to day $y$, we calculate it as $\\frac{\\sum \\limits_{i = x}^{y} a_i}{y - x + 1}$ (note that division is performed without any rounding). The heat intensity value is the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than $k$ consecutive days. For example, if analyzing the measures $[3, 4, 1, 2]$ and $k = 3$, we are interested in segments $[3, 4, 1]$, $[4, 1, 2]$ and $[3, 4, 1, 2]$ (we want to find the maximum value of average temperature over these segments).\n\nYou have been hired by Berland State University to write a program that would compute the heat intensity value of a given period of days.

Write a python script for the following problem: Beroffice text editor has a wide range of features that help working with text. One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.\n\nBeroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.\n\nFor example:\n -  the following words have typos: \"hellno\", \"hackcerrs\" and \"backtothefutttture\"; -  the following words don't have typos: \"helllllooooo\", \"tobeornottobe\" and \"oooooo\". \nWhen Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.\n\nImplement this feature of Beroffice editor. Consider the following letters as the only vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'. All the other letters are consonants in this problem.\nInput specification: The only line contains a non-empty word consisting of small English letters. The length of the word is between 1 and 3000 letters.. Output specification: Print the given word without any changes if there are no typos.\n\nIf there is at least one typo in the word, insert the minimum number of spaces into the word so that each of the resulting words doesn't have any typos.

Can you help Mahmoud determine the minimum cost of sending the message?\n\nThe cost of sending the message is the sum of the costs of sending every word in it.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains integers *n*, *k* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105,<=1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of words in their language, the number of groups of words, and the number of words in Mahmoud's message respectively.\n\nThe second line contains *n* strings consisting of lowercase English letters of length not exceeding 20 which represent the words. It's guaranteed that the words are distinct.\n\nThe third line contains *n* integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109) where *a**i* is the cost of sending the *i*-th word.\n\nThe next *k* lines describe the groups of words of same meaning. The next *k* lines each start with an integer *x* (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*) which means that there are *x* words in this group, followed by *x* integers which represent the indices of words in this group. It's guaranteed that each word appears in exactly one group.\n\nThe next line contains *m* space-separated words which represent Mahmoud's message. Each of these words appears in the list of language's words.. Output specification: The only line should contain the minimum cost to send the message after replacing some words (maybe none) with some words of the same meaning.\nDemo input: ['5 4 4\\ni loser am the second\\n100 1 1 5 10\\n1 1\\n1 3\\n2 2 5\\n1 4\\ni am the second\\n', '5 4 4\\ni loser am the second\\n100 20 1 5 10\\n1 1\\n1 3\\n2 2 5\\n1 4\\ni am the second\\n'], Demo output: ['107', '116']\nNote: In the first sample, Mahmoud should replace the word \"second\" with the word \"loser\" because it has less cost so the cost will be 100+1+5+1=107.\n\nIn the second sample, Mahmoud shouldn't do any replacement so the cost will be 100+1+5+10=116."}]}}

Limak can perform them in any order, any operation may be applied any number of times. The *i*-th operation is described by a string *a**i* of length two and a string *b**i* of length one. No two of *q* possible operations have the same string *a**i*.\n\nWhen Limak has a string *s* he can perform the *i*-th operation on *s* if the first two letters of *s* match a two-letter string *a**i*. Performing the *i*-th operation removes first two letters of *s* and inserts there a string *b**i*. See the notes section for further clarification.\n\nYou may note that performing an operation decreases the length of a string *s* exactly by 1. Also, for some sets of operations there may be a string that cannot be compressed any further, because the first two letters don't match any *a**i*.\n\nLimak wants to start with a string of length *n* and perform *n*<=-<=1 operations to finally get a one-letter string \"a\". In how many ways can he choose the starting string to be able to get \"a\"?

The mood can be positive, zero or negative.\n\nLet's define a subarray as a segment of consecutive flowers. The mother suggested some set of subarrays. Alyona wants to choose several of the subarrays suggested by her mother.

As we know from the previous problem, the nervous system of a zombie consists of *n* brains and *m* brain connectors joining some pairs of brains together. It was observed that the intellectual abilities of a zombie depend mainly on the topology of its nervous system. More precisely, we define the distance between two brains *u* and *v* (1<=\u2264<=*u*,<=*v*<=\u2264<=*n*) as the minimum number of brain connectors used when transmitting a thought between these two brains. The brain latency of a zombie is defined to be the maximum distance between any two of its brains. Researchers conjecture that the brain latency is the crucial parameter which determines how smart a given zombie is.

For example, a group (John, Bob, Limak) would be effective, while groups (Gary, Bob, Gary) and (Alice, Alice) wouldn't.\n\nYou are a spy in the enemy's camp. You noticed *n* soldiers standing in a row, numbered 1 through *n*. The general wants to choose a group of *k* consecutive soldiers. For every *k* consecutive soldiers, the general wrote down whether they would be an effective group or not.\n\nYou managed to steal the general's notes, with *n*<=-<=*k*<=+<=1 strings *s*1,<=*s*2,<=...,<=*s**n*<=-<=*k*<=+<=1, each either \"YES\" or \"NO\". \n -  The string *s*1 describes a group of soldiers 1 through *k* (\"YES\" if the group is effective, and \"NO\" otherwise). -  The string *s*2 describes a group of soldiers 2 through *k*<=+<=1. -  And so on, till the string *s**n*<=-<=*k*<=+<=1 that describes a group of soldiers *n*<=-<=*k*<=+<=1 through *n*. \nYour task is to find possible names of *n* soldiers. Names should match the stolen notes. Each name should be a string that consists of between 1 and 10 English letters, inclusive. The first letter should be uppercase, and all other letters should be lowercase. Names don't have to be existing names\u00a0\u2014 it's allowed to print \"Xyzzzdj\" or \"T\" for example.\n\nFind and print any solution. It can be proved that there always exists at least one solution.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50)\u00a0\u2014 the number of soldiers and the size of a group respectively.\n\nThe second line contains *n*<=-<=*k*<=+<=1 strings *s*1,<=*s*2,<=...,<=*s**n*<=-<=*k*<=+<=1. The string *s**i* is \"YES\" if the group of soldiers *i* through *i*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1 is effective, and \"NO\" otherwise.. Output specification: Find any solution satisfying all given conditions. In one line print *n* space-separated strings, denoting possible names of soldiers in the order. The first letter of each name should be uppercase, while the other letters should be lowercase. Each name should contain English letters only and has length from 1 to 10.\n\nIf there are multiple valid solutions, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['8 3\\nNO NO YES YES YES NO\\n', '9 8\\nYES NO\\n', '3 2\\nNO NO\\n'], Demo output: ['Adam Bob Bob Cpqepqwer Limak Adam Bob Adam', 'R Q Ccccccccc Ccocc Ccc So Strong Samples Ccc', 'Na Na Na']\nNote: In the first sample, there are 8 soldiers. For every 3 consecutive ones we know whether they would be an effective group. Let's analyze the provided sample output:\n -  First three soldiers (i.e. Adam, Bob, Bob) wouldn't be an effective group because there are two Bobs. Indeed, the string *s*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub> is \"NO\". -  Soldiers 2 through 4 (Bob, Bob, Cpqepqwer) wouldn't be effective either, and the string *s*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub> is \"NO\". -  Soldiers 3 through 5 (Bob, Cpqepqwer, Limak) would be effective, and the string *s*<sub class=\"lower-index\">3</sub> is \"YES\". -  ..., -  Soldiers 6 through 8 (Adam, Bob, Adam) wouldn't be effective, and the string *s*<sub class=\"lower-index\">6</sub> is \"NO\"."}]}}

The friend who is not busy in delivering the current package, is standing still.\n\nTo communicate with each other, the guys have got walkie-talkies. The walkie-talkies work rather poorly at great distances, so Petya and Vasya want to distribute the orders so that the maximum distance between them during the day is as low as possible.

And she has found one!\n\nWhy not make her own Codeforces, with blackjack and other really cool stuff? Many people will surely be willing to visit this splendid shrine of high culture.\n\nIn Mainframe a standard pack of 52 cards is used to play blackjack. The pack contains cards of 13 values: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jacks, queens, kings and aces. Each value also exists in one of four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. Also, each card earns some value in points assigned to it: cards with value from two to ten earn from 2 to 10 points, correspondingly. An ace can either earn 1 or 11, whatever the player wishes. The picture cards (king, queen and jack) earn 10 points. The number of points a card earns does not depend on the suit. The rules of the game are very simple. The player gets two cards, if the sum of points of those cards equals *n*, then the player wins, otherwise the player loses.\n\nThe player has already got the first card, it's the queen of spades. To evaluate chances for victory, you should determine how many ways there are to get the second card so that the sum of points exactly equals *n*.\nInput specification: The only line contains *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=25) \u2014 the required sum of points..

Each project (keep in mind that it is determined by both its name and version) might depend on other projects. For sure, there are no cyclic dependencies.\n\nYou're given a list of project descriptions. The first of the given projects is the one being developed by Polycarp at this moment. Help Polycarp determine all projects that his project depends on (directly or via a certain chain). \n\nIt's possible that Polycarp's project depends on two different versions of some project. In this case collision resolving is applied, i.e. for each such project the system chooses the version that minimizes the distance from it to Polycarp's project. If there are several options, the newer (with the maximum version) is preferred. This version is considered actual; other versions and their dependencies are ignored.\n\nMore formal, choose such a set of projects of minimum possible size that the following conditions hold: \n -  Polycarp's project is chosen; -  Polycarp's project depends (directly or indirectly) on all other projects in the set; -  no two projects share the name; -  for each project *x* that some other project in the set depends on we have either *x* or some *y* with other version and shorter chain to Polycarp's project chosen.

Note that a tree with *n* vertexes is an undirected connected graph that has exactly *n*<=-<=1 edges.\n\nPetya wondered how many vertex triples (*i*,<=*j*,<=*k*) exists that on the way from *i* to *j*, as well as on the way from *i* to *k* there must be at least one lucky edge (all three vertexes are pairwise distinct). The order of numbers in the triple matters, that is, the triple (1,<=2,<=3) is not equal to the triple (2,<=1,<=3) and is not equal to the triple (1,<=3,<=2). \n\nFind how many such triples of vertexes exist.\nInput specification: The first line contains the single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of tree vertexes.

Write a python script for the following problem: The heat during the last few days has been really intense. Scientists from all over the Berland study how the temperatures and weather change, and they claim that this summer is abnormally hot. But any scientific claim sounds a lot more reasonable if there are some numbers involved, so they have decided to actually calculate some value which would represent how high the temperatures are.\n\nMathematicians of Berland State University came up with a special heat intensity value. This value is calculated as follows:\n\nSuppose we want to analyze the segment of $n$ consecutive days. We have measured the temperatures during these $n$ days; the temperature during $i$-th day equals $a_i$.\n\nWe denote the average temperature of a segment of some consecutive days as the arithmetic mean of the temperature measures during this segment of days. So, if we want to analyze the average temperature from day $x$ to day $y$, we calculate it as $\\frac{\\sum \\limits_{i = x}^{y} a_i}{y - x + 1}$ (note that division is performed without any rounding). The heat intensity value is the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than $k$ consecutive days. For example, if analyzing the measures $[3, 4, 1, 2]$ and $k = 3$, we are interested in segments $[3, 4, 1]$, $[4, 1, 2]$ and $[3, 4, 1, 2]$ (we want to find the maximum value of average temperature over these segments).\n\nYou have been hired by Berland State University to write a program that would compute the heat intensity value of a given period of days. Are you up to this task?\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n \\le 5000$) \u2014 the number of days in the given period, and the minimum number of days in a segment we consider when calculating heat intensity value, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 5000$) \u2014 the temperature measures during given $n$ days.. Output specification: Print one real number \u2014 the heat intensity value, i. e., the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than $k$ consecutive days.\n\nYour answer will be considered correct if the following condition holds: $|res - res_0| &lt; 10^{-6}$, where $res$ is your answer, and $res_0$ is the answer given by the jury's solution.\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n3 4 1 2\\n'], Demo output: ['2.666666666666667\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Note that Genos's placement of the beacon means it will be the first beacon activated. Help Genos by finding the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000) \u2014 the initial number of beacons.\n\nThe *i*-th of next *n* lines contains two integers *a**i* and *b**i* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=1<=000<=000, 1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=1<=000<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the position and power level of the *i*-th beacon respectively. No two beacons will have the same position, so *a**i*<=\u2260<=*a**j* if *i*<=\u2260<=*j*.. Output specification: Print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added.\nDemo input: ['4\\n1 9\\n3 1\\n6 1\\n7 4\\n', '7\\n1 1\\n2 1\\n3 1\\n4 1\\n5 1\\n6 1\\n7 1\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '3\\n']\nNote: For the first sample case, the minimum number of beacons destroyed is 1. One way to achieve this is to place a beacon at position 9 with power level 2.\n\nFor the second sample case, the minimum number of beacons destroyed is 3. One way to achieve this is to place a beacon at position 1337 with power level 42."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya was on a physics practical, performing the task on measuring the capacitance. He followed the teacher's advice and did as much as *n* measurements, and recorded the results in the notebook. After that he was about to show the results to the teacher, but he remembered that at the last lesson, the teacher had made his friend Petya redo the experiment because the largest and the smallest results differed by more than two times. Vasya is lazy, and he does not want to redo the experiment. He wants to do the task and go home play computer games. So he decided to cheat: before Vasya shows the measurements to the teacher, he will erase some of them, so as to make the largest and the smallest results of the remaining measurements differ in no more than two times. In other words, if the remaining measurements have the smallest result *x*, and the largest result *y*, then the inequality *y*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7*x* must fulfill. Of course, to avoid the teacher's suspicion, Vasya wants to remove as few measurement results as possible from his notes.\n\nHelp Vasya, find what minimum number of measurement results he will have to erase from his notes so that the largest and the smallest of the remaining results of the measurements differed in no more than two times.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of measurements Vasya made.

Then the maximum of the remaining values will be 5, and the minimum one will be 3. Or else, you can remove the third and fifth results (both equal 3).

Print \"Tie\" (without quotes) if Limak and Radewoosh will get the same total number of points.\nDemo input: ['3 2\\n50 85 250\\n10 15 25\\n', '3 6\\n50 85 250\\n10 15 25\\n', '8 1\\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\\n8 10 58 63 71 72 75 76\\n'], Demo output: ['Limak\\n', 'Radewoosh\\n', 'Tie\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, there are 3 problems. Limak solves them as follows:\n 1.  Limak spends 10 minutes on the 1-st problem and he gets 50\u2009-\u2009*c*\u00b710\u2009=\u200950\u2009-\u20092\u00b710\u2009=\u200930 points. 1.  Limak spends 15 minutes on the 2-nd problem so he submits it 10\u2009+\u200915\u2009=\u200925 minutes after the start of the contest. For the 2-nd problem he gets 85\u2009-\u20092\u00b725\u2009=\u200935 points. 1.  He spends 25 minutes on the 3-rd problem so he submits it 10\u2009+\u200915\u2009+\u200925\u2009=\u200950 minutes after the start. For this problem he gets 250\u2009-\u20092\u00b750\u2009=\u2009150 points. \nSo, Limak got 30\u2009+\u200935\u2009+\u2009150\u2009=\u2009215 points.\n\nRadewoosh solves problem in the reversed order:\n 1.  Radewoosh solves 3-rd problem after 25 minutes so he gets 250\u2009-\u20092\u00b725\u2009=\u2009200 points. 1.  He spends 15 minutes on the 2-nd problem so he submits it 25\u2009+\u200915\u2009=\u200940 minutes after the start. He gets 85\u2009-\u20092\u00b740\u2009=\u20095 points for this problem. 1.  He spends 10 minutes on the 1-st problem so he submits it 25\u2009+\u200915\u2009+\u200910\u2009=\u200950 minutes after the start. He gets *max*(0,\u200950\u2009-\u20092\u00b750)\u2009=\u2009*max*(0,\u2009\u2009-\u200950)\u2009=\u20090 points. \nRadewoosh got 200\u2009+\u20095\u2009+\u20090\u2009=\u2009205 points in total. Limak has 215 points so Limak wins.\n\nIn the second sample, Limak will get 0 points for each problem and Radewoosh will first solve the hardest problem and he will get 250\u2009-\u20096\u00b725\u2009=\u2009100 points for that. Radewoosh will get 0 points for other two problems but he is the winner anyway.\n\nIn the third sample, Limak will get 2 points for the 1-st problem and 2 points for the 2-nd problem. Radewoosh will get 4 points for the 8-th problem. They won't get points for other problems and thus there is a tie because 2\u2009+\u20092\u2009=\u20094."}]}}

Each team is composed by a coach and three contestants. Blenda is the coach of the Bit State University(BSU), and she is very strict selecting the members of her team.\n\nIn BSU there are *n* students numbered from 1 to *n*. Since all BSU students are infinitely smart, the only important parameters for Blenda are their reading and writing speed. After a careful measuring, Blenda have found that the *i*-th student have a reading speed equal to *r**i* (words per minute), and a writing speed of *w**i* (symbols per minute). Since BSU students are very smart, the measured speeds are sometimes very big and Blenda have decided to subtract some constant value *c* from all the values of reading speed and some value *d* from all the values of writing speed. Therefore she considers *r**i*'<==<=*r**i*<=-<=*c* and *w**i*'<==<=*w**i*<=-<=*d*. \n\nThe student *i* is said to overwhelm the student *j* if and only if *r**i*'\u00b7*w**j*'<=&gt;<=*r**j*'\u00b7*w**i*'.

Yes, the relation of overwhelming is not transitive as it often happens in real life.\n\nSince Blenda is busy preparing a training camp in Codeforces, you are given a task to calculate the number of different good teams in BSU.

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, Dima met with Sasha in a philatelic store, and since then they are collecting coins together. Their favorite occupation is to sort collections of coins. Sasha likes having things in order, that is why he wants his coins to be arranged in a row in such a way that firstly come coins out of circulation, and then come coins still in circulation. \n\nFor arranging coins Dima uses the following algorithm. One step of his algorithm looks like the following:\n 1.  He looks through all the coins from left to right; 1.  If he sees that the *i*-th coin is still in circulation, and (*i*<=+<=1)-th coin is already out of circulation, he exchanges these two coins and continues watching coins from (*i*<=+<=1)-th. \nDima repeats the procedure above until it happens that no two coins were exchanged during this procedure. Dima calls hardness of ordering the number of steps required for him according to the algorithm above to sort the sequence, e.g. the number of times he looks through the coins from the very beginning. For example, for the ordered sequence hardness of ordering equals one.\n\nToday Sasha invited Dima and proposed him a game. First he puts *n* coins in a row, all of them are out of circulation. Then Sasha chooses one of the coins out of circulation and replaces it with a coin in circulation for *n* times. During this process Sasha constantly asks Dima what is the hardness of ordering of the sequence. \n\nThe task is more complicated because Dima should not touch the coins and he should determine hardness of ordering in his mind. Help Dima with this task.\nInput specification: The first line contains single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=300<=000)\u00a0\u2014 number of coins that Sasha puts behind Dima.\n\nSecond line contains *n* distinct integers *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=*n*)\u00a0\u2014 positions that Sasha puts coins in circulation to.

Unfortunately Max has forgotten the number which he had calculated.

One day when playing the game she wondered whether there exists a platform that the doodler couldn't reach due to the limits of its jumping ability. Consider the following problem.\n\nThere are *n* platforms. The height of the *x*-th (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*) platform is *a*\u00b7*x* mod *p*, where *a* and *p* are positive co-prime integers. The maximum possible height of a Doodler's jump is *h*. That is, it can jump from height *h*1 to height *h*2 (*h*1<=&lt;<=*h*2) if *h*2<=-<=*h*1<=\u2264<=*h*. Initially, the Doodler is on the ground, the height of which is 0. The question is whether it can reach the highest platform or not.\n\nFor example, when *a*<==<=7, *n*<==<=4, *p*<==<=12, *h*<==<=2, the heights of the platforms are 7, 2, 9, 4 as in the picture below. With the first jump the Doodler can jump to the platform at height 2, with the second one the Doodler can jump to the platform at height 4, but then it can't jump to any of the higher platforms. So, it can't reach the highest platform.\n\nUser xiaodao thought about the problem for a long time but didn't solve it, so she asks you for help. Also, she has a lot of instances of the problem.

Write a python script for the following problem: You know that Japan is the country with almost the largest 'electronic devices per person' ratio. So you might be quite surprised to find out that the primary school in Japan teaches to count using a Soroban \u2014 an abacus developed in Japan. This phenomenon has its reasons, of course, but we are not going to speak about them. Let's have a look at the Soroban's construction.\n\nSoroban consists of some number of rods, each rod contains five beads. We will assume that the rods are horizontal lines. One bead on each rod (the leftmost one) is divided from the others by a bar (the reckoning bar). This single bead is called go-dama and four others are ichi-damas. Each rod is responsible for representing a single digit from 0 to 9. We can obtain the value of a digit by following simple algorithm:\n -  Set the value of a digit equal to 0. -  If the go-dama is shifted to the right, add 5. -  Add the number of ichi-damas shifted to the left. \nThus, the upper rod on the picture shows digit 0, the middle one shows digit 2 and the lower one shows 7. We will consider the top rod to represent the last decimal digit of a number, so the picture shows number 720.\n\nWrite the program that prints the way Soroban shows the given number *n*.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=&lt;<=109).. Output specification: Print the description of the decimal digits of number *n* from the last one to the first one (as mentioned on the picture in the statement), one per line. Print the beads as large English letters 'O', rod pieces as character '-' and the reckoning bar as '|'. Print as many rods, as many digits are in the decimal representation of number *n* without leading zeroes. We can assume that number 0 has no leading zeroes.\nDemo input: ['2\\n', '13\\n', '720\\n'], Demo output: ['O-|OO-OO\\n', 'O-|OOO-O\\nO-|O-OOO\\n', 'O-|-OOOO\\nO-|OO-OO\\n-O|OO-OO\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

After the rotation the upper and the lower halves swap places. This action takes one second. Help Valera find out the minimum time he must spend rotating dominoes to make his wish come true.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), denoting the number of dominoes Valera has.

Both numbers are even, so Valera doesn't required to do anything.\n\nIn the second sample Valera has only one piece of domino. It is written 3 on the one of its halves, therefore one of the sums will always be odd.\n\nIn the third case Valera can rotate the first piece, and after that the sum on the upper halves will be equal to 10, and the sum on the lower halves will be equal to 8."}]}}

It is not always possible, so Vasya will move some element before dividing the array (Vasya will erase some element and insert it into an arbitrary position).\n\nInserting an element in the same position he was erased from is also considered moving.\n\nCan Vasya divide the array after choosing the right element to move and its new position?\nInput specification: The first line contains single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000) \u2014 the size of the array.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2... *a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the elements of the array..

First, the order in which the pies are to be handed out is decided. There is a special token called the \"decider\" token, initially held by Bob. Until all the pie is handed out, whoever has the decider token will give the next slice of pie to one of the participants, and the decider token to the other participant.

On the other hand, 05:50 is a palindrome, because 05:50 backwards is 05:50.\nInput specification: The first and only line of input contains a single string in the format hh:mm (00<=\u2264<= hh <=\u2264<=23, 00<=\u2264<= mm <=\u2264<=59).. Output specification: Output a single integer on a line by itself, the minimum number of minutes she should sleep, such that, when she wakes up, the time is a palindrome.\nDemo input: ['05:39\\n', '13:31\\n', '23:59\\n'], Demo output: ['11\\n', '0\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: In the first test case, the minimum number of minutes Karen should sleep for is 11. She can wake up at 05:50, when the time is a palindrome.\n\nIn the second test case, Karen can wake up immediately, as the current time, 13:31, is already a palindrome.\n\nIn the third test case, the minimum number of minutes Karen should sleep for is 1 minute. She can wake up at 00:00, when the time is a palindrome."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective. You are able to cope with it not worse, aren't you?\nInput specification: The first and single line contains two integers *A* and *B* (1<=\u2264<=*A*,<=*B*<=\u2264<=109,<=*min*(*A*,<=*B*)<=\u2264<=12)..

Write a python script for the following problem: Beroffice text editor has a wide range of features that help working with text. One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.\n\nBeroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.\n\nFor example:\n -  the following words have typos: \"hellno\", \"hackcerrs\" and \"backtothefutttture\"; -  the following words don't have typos: \"helllllooooo\", \"tobeornottobe\" and \"oooooo\". \nWhen Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.\n\nImplement this feature of Beroffice editor. Consider the following letters as the only vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'. All the other letters are consonants in this problem.\nInput specification: The only line contains a non-empty word consisting of small English letters. The length of the word is between 1 and 3000 letters.. Output specification: Print the given word without any changes if there are no typos.\n\nIf there is at least one typo in the word, insert the minimum number of spaces into the word so that each of the resulting words doesn't have any typos.

Write a python script for the following problem: Xenia the beginner programmer has a sequence *a*, consisting of 2*n* non-negative integers: *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a*2*n*. Xenia is currently studying bit operations. To better understand how they work, Xenia decided to calculate some value *v* for *a*.\n\nNamely, it takes several iterations to calculate value *v*. At the first iteration, Xenia writes a new sequence *a*1\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*2,<=*a*3\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*4,<=...,<=*a*2*n*<=-<=1\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*2*n*, consisting of 2*n*<=-<=1 elements. In other words, she writes down the bit-wise OR of adjacent elements of sequence *a*. At the second iteration, Xenia writes the bitwise exclusive OR of adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the first iteration. At the third iteration Xenia writes the bitwise OR of the adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the second iteration. And so on; the operations of bitwise exclusive OR and bitwise OR alternate. In the end, she obtains a sequence consisting of one element, and that element is *v*.\n\nLet's consider an example. Suppose that sequence *a*<==<=(1,<=2,<=3,<=4). Then let's write down all the transformations (1,<=2,<=3,<=4) <=\u2192<= (1\u00a0*or*\u00a02<==<=3,<=3\u00a0*or*\u00a04<==<=7) <=\u2192<= (3\u00a0*xor*\u00a07<==<=4). The result is *v*<==<=4.\n\nYou are given Xenia's initial sequence. But to calculate value *v* for a given sequence would be too easy, so you are given additional *m* queries. Each query is a pair of integers *p*,<=*b*. Query *p*,<=*b* means that you need to perform the assignment *a**p*<==<=*b*. After each query, you need to print the new value *v* for the new sequence *a*.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=17,<=1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105).

That's why every morning there is a line of five people in front of the dormitory shower door. As soon as the shower opens, the first person from the line enters the shower. After a while the first person leaves the shower and the next person enters the shower. The process continues until everybody in the line has a shower.\n\nHaving a shower takes some time, so the students in the line talk as they wait.

He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.\n\nOne day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest.

Fox Ciel has *m* cards, each one has these two attributes too. It's known that position of all Ciel's cards is Attack.\n\nNow is Ciel's battle phase, Ciel can do the following operation many times:\n 1.  Choose one of her cards *X*. This card mustn't be chosen before. 1.  If Jiro has no alive cards at that moment, he gets the damage equal to (*X*'s strength). Otherwise, Ciel needs to choose one Jiro's alive card *Y*, then:   If *Y*'s position is Attack, then (*X*'s strength) <=\u2265<= (*Y*'s strength) must hold. After this attack, card *Y* dies, and Jiro gets the damage equal to (*X*'s strength) - (*Y*'s strength). 1.  If *Y*'s position is Defense, then (*X*'s strength) <=&gt;<= (*Y*'s strength) must hold. After this attack, card *Y* dies, but Jiro gets no damage.  \nCiel can end her battle phase at any moment (so, she can use not all her cards).

The best strategy is as follows. First she uses one of these 3 cards to attack \"ATK 2000\" card first, this attack destroys that card and Jiro gets 2500\u2009-\u20092000\u2009=\u2009500 damage. Then she uses the second card to destroy the \"DEF 1700\" card. Jiro doesn't get damage that time. Now Jiro has no cards so she can use the third card to attack and Jiro gets 2500 damage. So the answer is 500\u2009+\u20092500\u2009=\u20093000.\n\nIn the second test case, she should use the \"1001\" card to attack the \"ATK 100\" card, then use the \"101\" card to attack the \"ATK 10\" card. Now Ciel still has cards but she can choose to end her battle phase. The total damage equals (1001\u2009-\u2009100)\u2009+\u2009(101\u2009-\u200910)\u2009=\u2009992.\n\nIn the third test case note that she can destroy the \"ATK 0\" card by a card with strength equal to 0, but she can't destroy a \"DEF 0\" card with that card."}]}}

Each knight was assigned his unique number \u2014 an integer from 1 to *n*. -  The tournament consisted of *m* fights, in the *i*-th fight the knights that were still in the game with numbers at least *l**i* and at most *r**i* have fought for the right to continue taking part in the tournament. -  After the *i*-th fight among all participants of the fight only one knight won \u2014 the knight number *x**i*, he continued participating in the tournament. Other knights left the tournament. -  The winner of the last (the *m*-th) fight (the knight number *x**m*) became the winner of the tournament. \nYou fished out all the information about the fights from your friends. Now for each knight you want to know the name of the knight he was conquered by. We think that the knight number *b* was conquered by the knight number *a*, if there was a fight with both of these knights present and the winner was the knight number *a*.\n\nWrite the code that calculates for each knight, the name of the knight that beat him.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n*, *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of knights and the number of fights. Each of the following *m* lines contains three integers *l**i*,<=*r**i*,<=*x**i* (1<=\u2264<=*l**i*<=&lt;<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*;\u00a0*l**i*<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=*r**i*) \u2014 the description of the *i*-th fight.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the input is correct and matches the problem statement. It is guaranteed that at least two knights took part in each battle.. Output specification: Print *n* integers. If the *i*-th knight lost, then the *i*-th number should equal the number of the knight that beat the knight number *i*. If the *i*-th knight is the winner, then the *i*-th number must equal 0.\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n1 2 1\\n1 3 3\\n1 4 4\\n', '8 4\\n3 5 4\\n3 7 6\\n2 8 8\\n1 8 1\\n'], Demo output: ['3 1 4 0 ', '0 8 4 6 4 8 6 1 ']\nNote: Consider the first test case. Knights 1 and 2 fought the first fight and knight 1 won. Knights 1 and 3 fought the second fight and knight 3 won. The last fight was between knights 3 and 4, knight 4 won."}]}}

Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.\n\nFor example:\n -  the following words have typos: \"hellno\", \"hackcerrs\" and \"backtothefutttture\"; -  the following words don't have typos: \"helllllooooo\", \"tobeornottobe\" and \"oooooo\". \nWhen Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.\n\nImplement this feature of Beroffice editor.

Write a python script for the following problem: Mashmokh's boss, Bimokh, didn't like Mashmokh. So he fired him. Mashmokh decided to go to university and participate in ACM instead of finding a new job. He wants to become a member of Bamokh's team. In order to join he was given some programming tasks and one week to solve them. Mashmokh is not a very experienced programmer. Actually he is not a programmer at all. So he wasn't able to solve them. That's why he asked you to help him with these tasks. One of these tasks is the following.\n\nA sequence of *l* integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**l* (1<=\u2264<=*b*1<=\u2264<=*b*2<=\u2264<=...<=\u2264<=*b**l*<=\u2264<=*n*) is called good if each number divides (without a remainder) by the next number in the sequence. More formally  for all *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*l*<=-<=1).\n\nGiven *n* and *k* find the number of good sequences of length *k*. As the answer can be rather large print it modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\nInput specification: The first line of input contains two space-separated integers *n*,<=*k*\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=2000).. Output specification: Output a single integer \u2014 the number of good sequences of length *k* modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\nDemo input: ['3 2\\n', '6 4\\n', '2 1\\n'], Demo output: ['5\\n', '39\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: In the first sample the good sequences are: [1,\u20091],\u2009[2,\u20092],\u2009[3,\u20093],\u2009[1,\u20092],\u2009[1,\u20093]."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Greg has an array *a*<==<=*a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* and *m* operations. Each operation looks as: *l**i*, *r**i*, *d**i*, (1<=\u2264<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*). To apply operation *i* to the array means to increase all array elements with numbers *l**i*,<=*l**i*<=+<=1,<=...,<=*r**i* by value *d**i*.\n\nGreg wrote down *k* queries on a piece of paper. Each query has the following form: *x**i*, *y**i*, (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=*m*). That means that one should apply operations with numbers *x**i*,<=*x**i*<=+<=1,<=...,<=*y**i* to the array.\n\nNow Greg is wondering, what the array *a* will be after all the queries are executed. Help Greg.\nInput specification: The first line contains integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=105). The second line contains *n* integers: *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the initial array.\n\nNext *m* lines contain operations, the operation number *i* is written as three integers: *l**i*, *r**i*, *d**i*, (1<=\u2264<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*), (0<=\u2264<=*d**i*<=\u2264<=105).\n\nNext *k* lines contain the queries, the query number *i* is written as two integers: *x**i*, *y**i*, (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nThe numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.. Output specification: On a single line print *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* \u2014 the array after executing all the queries. Separate the printed numbers by spaces.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++.

Write a python script for the following problem: While Farmer John rebuilds his farm in an unfamiliar portion of Bovinia, Bessie is out trying some alternative jobs. In her new gig as a reporter, Bessie needs to know about programming competition results as quickly as possible. When she covers the 2016 Robot Rap Battle Tournament, she notices that all of the robots operate under deterministic algorithms. In particular, robot *i* will beat robot *j* if and only if robot *i* has a higher skill level than robot *j*. And if robot *i* beats robot *j* and robot *j* beats robot *k*, then robot *i* will beat robot *k*. Since rapping is such a subtle art, two robots can never have the same skill level.\n\nGiven the results of the rap battles in the order in which they were played, determine the minimum number of first rap battles that needed to take place before Bessie could order all of the robots by skill level.\nInput specification: The first line of the input consists of two integers, the number of robots *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000) and the number of rap battles *m* ().\n\nThe next *m* lines describe the results of the rap battles in the order they took place.

No two rap battles involve the same pair of robots.\n\nIt is guaranteed that at least one ordering of the robots satisfies all *m* relations.. Output specification: Print the minimum *k* such that the ordering of the robots by skill level is uniquely defined by the first *k* rap battles. If there exists more than one ordering that satisfies all *m* relations, output -1.\nDemo input: ['4 5\\n2 1\\n1 3\\n2 3\\n4 2\\n4 3\\n', '3 2\\n1 2\\n3 2\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, the robots from strongest to weakest must be (4,\u20092,\u20091,\u20093), which Bessie can deduce after knowing the results of the first four rap battles.\n\nIn the second sample, both (1,\u20093,\u20092) and (3,\u20091,\u20092) are possible orderings of the robots from strongest to weakest after both rap battles."}]}}
