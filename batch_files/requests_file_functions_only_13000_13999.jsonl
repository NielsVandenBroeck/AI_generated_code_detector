There's no surprise that you slept in this morning and were late for the tournament (it was a weekend, after all). Now you are really curious about the results of the tournament. This time the tournament in Berland went as follows:\n -  There are *n* knights participating in the tournament. Each knight was assigned his unique number \u2014 an integer from 1 to *n*. -  The tournament consisted of *m* fights, in the *i*-th fight the knights that were still in the game with numbers at least *l**i* and at most *r**i* have fought for the right to continue taking part in the tournament. -  After the *i*-th fight among all participants of the fight only one knight won \u2014 the knight number *x**i*, he continued participating in the tournament. Other knights left the tournament. -  The winner of the last (the *m*-th) fight (the knight number *x**m*) became the winner of the tournament. \nYou fished out all the information about the fights from your friends. Now for each knight you want to know the name of the knight he was conquered by. We think that the knight number *b* was conquered by the knight number *a*, if there was a fight with both of these knights present and the winner was the knight number *a*.\n\nWrite the code that calculates for each knight, the name of the knight that beat him.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n*, *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of knights and the number of fights.

Find out how the deminations of the coins differ or if Vasya has a mistake in the weighting results. No two coins are equal.\nInput specification: The input data contains the results of all the weighting, one result on each line. It is guaranteed that every coin pair was weighted exactly once. Vasya labelled the coins with letters \u00abA\u00bb, \u00abB\u00bb and \u00abC\u00bb. Each result is a line that appears as (letter)(&gt; or &lt; sign)(letter). For example, if coin \"A\" proved lighter than coin \"B\", the result of the weighting is A&lt;B.. Output specification: It the results are contradictory, print Impossible. Otherwise, print without spaces the rearrangement of letters \u00abA\u00bb, \u00abB\u00bb and \u00abC\u00bb which represent the coins in the increasing order of their weights.\nDemo input: ['A&gt;B\\nC&lt;B\\nA&gt;C\\n', 'A&lt;B\\nB&gt;C\\nC&gt;A\\n'], Demo output: ['CBA', 'ACB']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Polycarp is flying in the airplane. Finally, it is his favorite time \u2014 the lunchtime. The BerAvia company stewardess is giving food consecutively to all the passengers from the 1-th one to the last one. Polycarp is sitting on seat *m*, that means, he will be the *m*-th person to get food.\n\nThe flight menu has *k* dishes in total and when Polycarp boarded the flight, he had time to count the number of portions of each dish on board. Thus, he knows values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**k*, where *a**i* is the number of portions of the *i*-th dish.\n\nThe stewardess has already given food to *m*<=-<=1 passengers, gave Polycarp a polite smile and asked him what he would prefer. That's when Polycarp realized that they might have run out of some dishes by that moment. For some of the *m*<=-<=1 passengers ahead of him, he noticed what dishes they were given. Besides, he's heard some strange mumbling from some of the *m*<=-<=1 passengers ahead of him, similar to phrase 'I'm disappointed'. That happened when a passenger asked for some dish but the stewardess gave him a polite smile and said that they had run out of that dish. In that case the passenger needed to choose some other dish that was available. If Polycarp heard no more sounds from a passenger, that meant that the passenger chose his dish at the first try.\n\nHelp Polycarp to find out for each dish: whether they could have run out of the dish by the moment Polyarp was served or that dish was definitely available.\nInput specification: Each test in this problem consists of one or more input sets. First goes a string that contains a single integer *t* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100<=000) \u2014 the number of input data sets in the test. Then the sets follow, each set is preceded by an empty line.\n\nThe first line of each set of the input contains integers *m*, *k* (2<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100<=000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=100<=000) \u2014 the number of Polycarp's seat and the number of dishes, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of *k* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**k* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100<=000), where *a**i* is the initial number of portions of the *i*-th dish.\n\nThen *m*<=-<=1 lines follow, each line contains the description of Polycarp's observations about giving food to a passenger sitting in front of him: the *j*-th line contains a pair of integers *t**j*,<=*r**j* (0<=\u2264<=*t**j*<=\u2264<=*k*,<=0<=\u2264<=*r**j*<=\u2264<=1), where *t**j* is the number of the dish that was given to the *j*-th passenger (or 0, if Polycarp didn't notice what dish was given to the passenger), and *r**j* \u2014 a 1 or a 0, depending on whether the *j*-th passenger was or wasn't disappointed, respectively.\n\nWe know that sum *a**i* equals at least *m*, that is,Polycarp will definitely get some dish, even if it is the last thing he wanted. It is guaranteed that the data is consistent.\n\nSum *m* for all input sets doesn't exceed 100<=000. Sum *k* for all input sets doesn't exceed 100<=000.. Output specification: For each input set print the answer as a single line. Print a string of *k* letters \"Y\" or \"N\". Letter \"Y\" in position *i* should be printed if they could have run out of the *i*-th dish by the time the stewardess started serving Polycarp.\nDemo input: ['2\\n\\n3 4\\n2 3 2 1\\n1 0\\n0 0\\n\\n5 5\\n1 2 1 3 1\\n3 0\\n0 0\\n2 1\\n4 0\\n'], Demo output: ['YNNY\\nYYYNY\\n']\nNote: In the first input set depending on the choice of the second passenger the situation could develop in different ways:\n -  If he chose the first dish, then by the moment the stewardess reaches Polycarp, they will have run out of the first dish; -  If he chose the fourth dish, then by the moment the stewardess reaches Polycarp, they will have run out of the fourth dish; -  Otherwise, Polycarp will be able to choose from any of the four dishes. \nThus, the answer is \"YNNY\".\n\nIn the second input set there is, for example, the following possible scenario. First, the first passenger takes the only third dish, then the second passenger takes the second dish. Then, the third passenger asks for the third dish, but it is not available, so he makes disappointed muttering and ends up with the second dish. Then the fourth passenger takes the fourth dish, and Polycarp ends up with the choice between the first, fourth and fifth dish.\n\nLikewise, another possible scenario is when by the time the stewardess comes to Polycarp, they will have run out of either the first or the fifth dish (this can happen if one of these dishes is taken by the second passenger). It is easy to see that there is more than enough of the fourth dish, so Polycarp can always count on it. Thus, the answer is \"YYYNY\"."}]}}

Each of the cupboards has two doors: the left one and the right one. Karlsson remembers that when he rushed to the kitchen, all the cupboards' left doors were in the same position (open or closed), similarly, all the cupboards' right doors were in the same position (open or closed). Karlsson wants the doors to meet this condition as well by the time the family returns. Karlsson does not remember the position of all the left doors, also, he cannot remember the position of all the right doors. Therefore, it does not matter to him in what position will be all left or right doors. It is important to leave all the left doors in the same position, and all the right doors in the same position. For example, all the left doors may be closed, and all the right ones may be open.\n\nKarlsson needs one second to open or close a door of a cupboard. He understands that he has very little time before the family returns, so he wants to know the minimum number of seconds *t*, in which he is able to bring all the cupboard doors in the required position.\n\nYour task is to write a program that will determine the required number of seconds *t*.\nInput specification: The first input line contains a single integer *n* \u2014 the number of cupboards in the kitchen (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=104). Then follow *n* lines, each containing two integers *l**i* and *r**i* (0<=\u2264<=*l**i*,<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=1). Number *l**i* equals one, if the left door of the *i*-th cupboard is opened, otherwise number *l**i* equals zero. Similarly, number *r**i* equals one, if the right door of the *i*-th cupboard is opened, otherwise number *r**i* equals zero.\n\nThe numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.. Output specification: In the only output line print a single integer *t* \u2014 the minimum number of seconds Karlsson needs to change the doors of all cupboards to the position he needs.\nDemo input: ['5\\n0 1\\n1 0\\n0 1\\n1 1\\n0 1\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Recently Billy studied the concept of a digital root of a number. We should remind you that a digital root *d*(*x*) of the number *x* is the sum *s*(*x*) of all the digits of this number, if *s*(*x*)<=\u2264<=9, otherwise it is *d*(*s*(*x*)). For example, a digital root of the number 6543 is calculated as follows: *d*(6543)<==<=*d*(6<=+<=5<=+<=4<=+<=3)<==<=*d*(18)<==<=9. Billy has counted that the digital root of a product of numbers is equal to the digital root of the product of the factors' digital roots, i.e. *d*(*xy*)<==<=*d*(*d*(*x*)*d*(*y*)). And the following solution to the problem came to his mind: to calculate the digital roots and check if this condition is met. However, Billy has doubts that this condition is sufficient. That's why he asks you to find out the amount of test examples for the given problem such that the algorithm proposed by Billy makes mistakes.\nInput specification: The first line contains the only number *N* (1<=\u2264<=*N*<=\u2264<=106)..

Write a python script for the following problem: Once upon a time, when the world was more beautiful, the sun shone brighter, the grass was greener and the sausages tasted better Arlandia was the most powerful country. And its capital was the place where our hero DravDe worked. He couldn\u2019t program or make up problems (in fact, few people saw a computer those days) but he was nevertheless happy. He worked in a warehouse where a magical but non-alcoholic drink Ogudar-Olok was kept. We won\u2019t describe his work in detail and take a better look at a simplified version of the warehouse.\n\nThe warehouse has one set of shelving. It has *n* shelves, each of which is divided into *m* sections. The shelves are numbered from top to bottom starting from 1 and the sections of each shelf are numbered from left to right also starting from 1. Each section can contain exactly one box of the drink, and try as he might, DravDe can never put a box in a section that already has one. In the course of his work DravDe frequently notices that he has to put a box in a filled section. In that case his solution is simple. DravDe ignores that section and looks at the next one to the right. If it is empty, he puts the box there. Otherwise he keeps looking for the first empty section to the right. If no empty section is found by the end of the shelf, he looks at the shelf which is under it, then the next one, etc. Also each time he looks at a new shelf he starts from the shelf\u2019s beginning. If DravDe still can\u2019t find an empty section for the box, he immediately drinks it all up and throws the empty bottles away not to be caught.\n\nAfter one great party with a lot of Ogudar-Olok drunk DravDe asked you to help him. Unlike him, you can program and therefore modeling the process of counting the boxes in the warehouse will be easy work for you.\n\nThe process of counting contains two types of query messages: \n -  \u00ab+1 x y id\u00bb (where *x*, *y* are integers, 1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*, 1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*, and *id* is a string of lower case Latin letters \u2014 from 1 to 10 characters long). That query means that the warehouse got a box identified as *id*, which should be put in the section *y* on the shelf *x*. If the section is full, use the rules described above. It is guaranteed that every moment of the process the identifiers of all the boxes in the warehouse are different. You don\u2019t have to answer this query. -  \u00ab-1 id\u00bb (where *id* is a string of lower case Latin letters \u2014 from 1 to 10 characters long). That query means that a box identified as *id* is removed from the warehouse. You have to answer this query (see output format).\nInput specification: The first input line contains integers *n*, *m* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=30, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=2000) \u2014 the height, the width of shelving and the amount of the operations in the warehouse that you need to analyze.

Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\n\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively.

Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice.

Alice immediately took an orange for herself, Bob took an apple. To make the process of sharing the remaining fruit more fun, the friends decided to play a game. They put multiple cards and on each one they wrote a letter, either 'A', or the letter 'B'. Then they began to remove the cards one by one from left to right, every time they removed a card with the letter 'A', Alice gave Bob all the fruits she had at that moment and took out of the bag as many apples and as many oranges as she had before. Thus the number of oranges and apples Alice had, did not change. If the card had written letter 'B', then Bob did the same, that is, he gave Alice all the fruit that he had, and took from the bag the same set of fruit. After the last card way removed, all the fruit in the bag were over.\n\nYou know how many oranges and apples was in the bag at first.

Output specification: Print any sequence of cards that would meet the problem conditions as a compressed string of characters 'A' and 'B.

The string that you print should consist of at most 106 characters. It is guaranteed that if the answer exists, its compressed representation exists, consisting of at most 106 characters. If there are several possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them.\n\nIf the sequence of cards that meet the problem statement does not not exist, print a single word Impossible.\nDemo input: ['1 4\\n', '2 2\\n', '3 2\\n'], Demo output: ['3B\\n', 'Impossible\\n', '1A1B\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, if the row contained three cards with letter 'B', then Bob should give one apple to Alice three times. So, in the end of the game Alice has one orange and three apples, and Bob has one apple, in total it is one orange and four apples.\n\nIn second sample, there is no answer since one card is not enough for game to finish, and two cards will produce at least three apples or three oranges.\n\nIn the third sample, cards contain letters 'AB', so after removing the first card Bob has one orange and one apple, and after removal of second card Alice has two oranges and one apple.

One of its many weird features is the method of character-based output, known as Turing Tape method. It converts an array of unsigned 8-bit integers into a sequence of characters to print, using the following method.\n\nThe integers of the array are processed one by one, starting from the first. Processing *i*-th element of the array is done in three steps:\n\n1. The 8-bit binary notation of the ASCII-code of the previous printed character is reversed. When the first element of the array is processed, the result of this step is considered to be 0.\n\n2. The *i*-th element of the array is subtracted from the result of the previous step modulo 256.\n\n3. The binary notation of the result of the previous step is reversed again to produce ASCII-code of the *i*-th character to be printed.\n\nYou are given the text printed using this method. Restore the array used to produce this text.\nInput specification: The input will consist of a single line *text* which contains the message printed using the described method. String *text* will contain between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive. ASCII-code of each character of *text* will be between 32 (space) and 126 (tilde), inclusive..

First, the order in which the pies are to be handed out is decided. There is a special token called the \"decider\" token, initially held by Bob. Until all the pie is handed out, whoever has the decider token will give the next slice of pie to one of the participants, and the decider token to the other participant. They continue until no slices of pie are left.\n\nAll of the slices are of excellent quality, so each participant obviously wants to maximize the total amount of pie they get to eat. Assuming both players make their decisions optimally, how much pie will each participant receive?\nInput specification: Input will begin with an integer *N* (1<=\u2264<=*N*<=\u2264<=50), the number of slices of pie. \n\nFollowing this is a line with *N* integers indicating the sizes of the slices (each between 1 and 100000, inclusive), in the order in which they must be handed out.. Output specification: Print two integers. First, the sum of the sizes of slices eaten by Alice, then the sum of the sizes of the slices eaten by Bob, assuming both players make their decisions optimally.\nDemo input: ['3\\n141 592 653\\n', '5\\n10 21 10 21 10\\n'], Demo output: ['653 733\\n', '31 41\\n']\nNote: In the first example, Bob takes the size 141 slice for himself and gives the decider token to Alice. Then Alice gives the size 592 slice to Bob and keeps the decider token for herself, so that she can then give the size 653 slice to herself."}]}}

For example, the median of the set 5, 1, 2 is number 2, and the median of set 1, 0, 1 is equal to 1.\n\nIn order to make the task easier, Vasya decided to apply the method to sequences consisting of zeros and ones only.\n\nHaving made the procedure once, Vasya looked at the resulting sequence and thought: what if I apply the algorithm to it once again, and then apply it to the next result, and so on? Vasya tried a couple of examples and found out that after some number of median smoothing algorithm applications the sequence can stop changing. We say that the sequence is stable, if it does not change when the median smoothing is applied to it.\n\nNow Vasya wonders, whether the sequence always eventually becomes stable. He asks you to write a program that, given a sequence of zeros and ones, will determine whether it ever becomes stable. Moreover, if it ever becomes stable, then you should determine what will it look like and how many times one needs to apply the median smoothing algorithm to initial sequence in order to obtain a stable one.\nInput specification: The first input line of the input contains a single integer *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=500<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the initial sequence.\n\nThe next line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (*a**i*<==<=0 or *a**i*<==<=1), giving the initial sequence itself.. Output specification: If the sequence will never become stable, print a single number <=-<=1.\n\nOtherwise, first print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of times one needs to apply the median smoothing algorithm to the initial sequence before it becomes is stable. In the second line print *n* numbers separated by a space \u00a0\u2014 the resulting sequence itself.\nDemo input: ['4\\n0 0 1 1\\n', '5\\n0 1 0 1 0\\n'], Demo output: ['0\\n0 0 1 1\\n', '2\\n0 0 0 0 0\\n']\nNote: In the second sample the stabilization occurs in two steps: <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/5a983e7baab048cbe43812cb997c15e9d7100231.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, and the sequence 00000 is obviously stable."}]}}

First you need to choose the \"root\" of the word \u2014 some string which has more than 4 letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3 symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction \u2014  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row. All these strings are considered to be suffixes of the word (this time we use word \"suffix\" to describe a morpheme but not the few last characters of the string as you may used to). \n\nHere is one exercise that you have found in your task list. You are given the word *s*. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language. \n\nTwo strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match. \n\nLet's look at the example: the word *abacabaca* is given.

A pair of numbers {*a*,<=*b*} is called coprime if the maximum number that divides both *a* and *b* is equal to one. \n\nYour friend often comes up with different statements. He has recently supposed that if the pair (*a*,<=*b*) is coprime and the pair (*b*,<=*c*) is coprime, then the pair (*a*,<=*c*) is coprime. \n\nYou want to find a counterexample for your friend's statement.

Write a python script for the following problem: Mad scientist Mike has just finished constructing a new device to search for extraterrestrial intelligence! He was in such a hurry to launch it for the first time that he plugged in the power wires without giving it a proper glance and started experimenting right away. After a while Mike observed that the wires ended up entangled and now have to be untangled again.\n\nThe device is powered by two wires \"plus\" and \"minus\". The wires run along the floor from the wall (on the left) to the device (on the right). Both the wall and the device have two contacts in them on the same level, into which the wires are plugged in some order. The wires are considered entangled if there are one or more places where one wire runs above the other one. For example, the picture below has four such places (top view):\n\nMike knows the sequence in which the wires run above each other. Mike also noticed that on the left side, the \"plus\" wire is always plugged into the top contact (as seen on the picture). He would like to untangle the wires without unplugging them and without moving the device. Determine if it is possible to do that. A wire can be freely moved and stretched on the floor, but cannot be cut.\n\nTo understand the problem better please read the notes to the test samples.\nInput specification: The single line of the input contains a sequence of characters \"+\" and \"-\" of length *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000).

To untangle the wires, one can first move the \"plus\" wire lower, thus eliminating the two crosses in the middle, and then draw it under the \"minus\" wire, eliminating also the remaining two crosses.\n\nIn the second testcase the \"plus\" wire makes one full revolution around the \"minus\" wire. Thus the wires cannot be untangled: \n\nIn the third testcase the \"plus\" wire simply runs above the \"minus\" wire twice in sequence. The wires can be untangled by lifting \"plus\" and moving it higher: \n\nIn the fourth testcase the \"minus\" wire runs above the \"plus\" wire once. The wires cannot be untangled without moving the device itself:"}]}}

For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\n\nVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads \u2014 major and minor.\n\nLet's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes *X*, *Y* and *Z*. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between *X* and *Y* equals 4 semitones and the distance between *Y* and *Z* is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between *X* and *Z*, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.\n\nA minor triad is different in that the distance between *X* and *Y* should be 3 semitones and between *Y* and *Z* \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nFor example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nHelp Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\nInput specification: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.. Output specification: Print \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor.

That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\nDemo input: ['C E G\\n', 'C# B F\\n', 'A B H\\n'], Demo output: ['major\\n', 'minor\\n', 'strange\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

As everybody in the evil land knows, Dr. Evil likes bipartite graphs, especially trees.\n\nA tree is a connected acyclic graph. A bipartite graph is a graph, whose vertices can be partitioned into 2 sets in such a way, that for each edge (*u*,<=*v*) that belongs to the graph, *u* and *v* belong to different sets. You can find more formal definitions of a tree and a bipartite graph in the notes section below.\n\nDr. Evil gave Mahmoud and Ehab a tree consisting of *n* nodes and asked them to add edges to it in such a way, that the graph is still bipartite. Besides, after adding these edges the graph should be simple (doesn't contain loops or multiple edges). What is the maximum number of edges they can add?\n\nA loop is an edge, which connects a node with itself. Graph doesn't contain multiple edges when for each pair of nodes there is no more than one edge between them. A cycle and a loop aren't the same .\nInput specification: The first line of input contains an integer *n*\u00a0\u2014 the number of nodes in the tree (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105).\n\nThe next *n*<=-<=1 lines contain integers *u* and *v* (1<=\u2264<=*u*,<=*v*<=\u2264<=*n*, *u*<=\u2260<=*v*)\u00a0\u2014 the description of the edges of the tree.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the given graph is a tree..

At first night he received embosser and was to take stock of the whole exposition.\n\nEmbosser is a special devise that allows to \"print\" the text of a plastic tape. Text is printed sequentially, character by character. The device consists of a wheel with a lowercase English letters written in a circle, static pointer to the current letter and a button that print the chosen letter. At one move it's allowed to rotate the alphabetic wheel one step clockwise or counterclockwise. Initially, static pointer points to letter 'a'. Other letters are located as shown on the picture:\n\nAfter Grigoriy add new item to the base he has to print its name on the plastic tape and attach it to the corresponding exhibit. It's not required to return the wheel to its initial position with pointer on the letter 'a'.\n\nOur hero is afraid that some exhibits may become alive and start to attack him, so he wants to print the names as fast as possible.

When you teach him, you are supposed to teach all the chapters of a subject continuously.\n\nLet us say that his initial per chapter learning power of a subject is *x* hours. In other words he can learn a chapter of a particular subject in *x* hours.\n\nWell Devu is not complete dumb, there is a good thing about him too. If you teach him a subject, then time required to teach any chapter of the next subject will require exactly 1 hour less than previously required (see the examples to understand it more clearly). Note that his per chapter learning power can not be less than 1 hour.\n\nYou can teach him the *n* subjects in any possible order. Find out minimum amount of time (in hours) Devu will take to understand all the subjects and you will be free to do some enjoying task rather than teaching a dumb guy.\n\nPlease be careful that answer might not fit in 32 bit data type.\nInput specification: The first line will contain two space separated integers *n*, *x* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*x*<=\u2264<=105). The next line will contain *n* space separated integers: *c*1,<=*c*2,<=...,<=*c**n* (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=105).. Output specification: Output a single integer representing the answer to the problem.\nDemo input: ['2 3\\n4 1\\n', '4 2\\n5 1 2 1\\n', '3 3\\n1 1 1\\n'], Demo output: ['11\\n', '10\\n', '6\\n']\nNote: Look at the first example. Consider the order of subjects: 1, 2. When you teach Devu the first subject, it will take him 3 hours per chapter, so it will take 12 hours to teach first subject. After teaching first subject, his per chapter learning time will be 2 hours. Now teaching him second subject will take 2\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009=\u20092 hours. Hence you will need to spend 12\u2009+\u20092\u2009=\u200914 hours.\n\nConsider the order of subjects: 2, 1. When you teach Devu the second subject, then it will take him 3 hours per chapter, so it will take 3\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009=\u20093 hours to teach the second subject. After teaching the second subject, his per chapter learning time will be 2 hours. Now teaching him the first subject will take 2\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009=\u20098 hours. Hence you will need to spend 11 hours.\n\nSo overall, minimum of both the cases is 11 hours.\n\nLook at the third example. The order in this example doesn't matter. When you teach Devu the first subject, it will take him 3 hours per chapter. When you teach Devu the second subject, it will take him 2 hours per chapter. When you teach Devu the third subject, it will take him 1 hours per chapter. In total it takes 6 hours."}]}}

First you need to choose the \"root\" of the word \u2014 some string which has more than 4 letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3 symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction \u2014  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row. All these strings are considered to be suffixes of the word (this time we use word \"suffix\" to describe a morpheme but not the few last characters of the string as you may used to). \n\nHere is one exercise that you have found in your task list. You are given the word *s*. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language. \n\nTwo strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match. \n\nLet's look at the example: the word *abacabaca* is given. This word can be obtained in the following ways: , where the root of the word is overlined, and suffixes are marked by \"corners\".

A dormitory is a whole new world of funny amusements and possibilities but it does have its drawbacks. \n\nThere is only one shower and there are multiple students who wish to have a shower in the morning. That's why every morning there is a line of five people in front of the dormitory shower door. As soon as the shower opens, the first person from the line enters the shower. After a while the first person leaves the shower and the next person enters the shower.

A palindromic number is another matter. It is aesthetically pleasing, and it has a number of remarkable properties. Help Rikhail to convince the scientific community in this!\n\nLet us remind you that a number is called prime if it is integer larger than one, and is not divisible by any positive integer other than itself and one.\n\nRikhail calls a number a palindromic if it is integer, positive, and its decimal representation without leading zeros is a palindrome, i.e. reads the same from left to right and right to left.\n\nOne problem with prime numbers is that there are too many of them. Let's introduce the following notation: \u03c0(*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of primes no larger than *n*, *rub*(*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of palindromic numbers no larger than *n*.

The product of numbers from the first set gives the fraction numerator, the product of numbers from the second set gives the fraction denominator.

First, he thought of *n*<=-<=1 positive integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1. For every integer *i* where 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1 the condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* holds. Next, he made *n*<=-<=1 portals, numbered by integers from 1 to *n*<=-<=1. The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) portal connects cell *i* and cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*), and one can travel from cell *i* to cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) using the *i*-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) to cell *i* using the *i*-th portal. It is easy to see that because of condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* one can't leave the Line World using portals.\n\nCurrently, I am standing at cell 1, and I want to go to cell *t*.

He taught it to walk the shortest path from one point to another, to record all its movements, but like in many Draude's programs, there was a bug \u2014 the robot didn't always walk the shortest path. Fortunately, the robot recorded its own movements correctly. Now Draude wants to find out when his robot functions wrong. Heh, if Draude only remembered the map of the field, where he tested the robot, he would easily say if the robot walked in the right direction or not. But the field map was lost never to be found, that's why he asks you to find out if there exist at least one map, where the path recorded by the robot is the shortest.\n\nThe map is an infinite checkered field, where each square is either empty, or contains an obstruction. It is also known that the robot never tries to run into the obstruction. By the recorded robot's movements find out if there exist at least one such map, that it is possible to choose for the robot a starting square (the starting square should be empty) such that when the robot moves from this square its movements coincide with the recorded ones (the robot doesn't run into anything, moving along empty squares only), and the path from the starting square to the end one is the shortest.\n\nIn one movement the robot can move into the square (providing there are no obstrutions in this square) that has common sides with the square the robot is currently in.\nInput specification: The first line of the input file contains the recording of the robot's movements.

His current work task is to create a search engine for the website of the company. During the development process, he needs to write a subroutine for comparing strings *S* and *T* of equal length to be \"similar\". After a brief search on the Internet, he learned about the Hamming distance between two strings *S* and *T* of the same length, which is defined as the number of positions in which *S* and *T* have different characters. For example, the Hamming distance between words \"permanent\" and \"pergament\" is two, as these words differ in the fourth and sixth letters.\n\nMoreover, as he was searching for information, he also noticed that modern search engines have powerful mechanisms to correct errors in the request to improve the quality of search. Ford doesn't know much about human beings, so he assumed that the most common mistake in a request is swapping two arbitrary letters of the string (not necessarily adjacent). Now he wants to write a function that determines which two letters should be swapped in string *S*, so that the Hamming distance between a new string *S* and string *T* would be as small as possible, or otherwise, determine that such a replacement cannot reduce the distance between the strings.\n\nHelp him do this!\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200<=000) \u2014 the length of strings *S* and *T*.\n\nThe second line contains string *S*.\n\nThe third line contains string *T*.\n\nEach of the lines only contains lowercase Latin letters..

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes.

Then follow *k* lines, each of them contains two integers *dx**i* and *dy**i* (|*dx**i*|,<=|*dy**i*|<=\u2264<=109,<=|*dx*|<=+<=|*dy*|<=\u2265<=1).. Output specification: Print the single number \u2014 the number of steps Vasya had made.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++.

So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091). He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Allen dreams of one day owning a enormous fleet of electric cars, the car of the future! He knows that this will give him a big status boost. As Allen is planning out all of the different types of cars he will own and how he will arrange them, he realizes that he has a problem. \n\nAllen's future parking lot can be represented as a rectangle with $4$ rows and $n$ ($n \\le 50$) columns of rectangular spaces, each of which can contain at most one car at any time. He imagines having $k$ ($k \\le 2n$) cars in the grid, and all the cars are initially in the second and third rows. Each of the cars also has a different designated parking space in the first or fourth row. Allen has to put the cars into corresponding parking places.\n\nHowever, since Allen would never entrust his cars to anyone else, only one car can be moved at a time. He can drive a car from a space in any of the four cardinal directions to a neighboring empty space. Furthermore, Allen can only move one of his cars into a space on the first or fourth rows if it is the car's designated parking space. \n\nAllen knows he will be a very busy man, and will only have time to move cars at most $20000$ times before he realizes that moving cars is not worth his time. Help Allen determine if he should bother parking his cars or leave it to someone less important.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$, $1 \\le k \\le 2n$), representing the number of columns and the number of cars, respectively.\n\nThe next four lines will contain $n$ integers each between $0$ and $k$ inclusive, representing the initial state of the parking lot. The rows are numbered $1$ to $4$ from top to bottom and the columns are numbered $1$ to $n$ from left to right.\n\nIn the first and last line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents a parking spot assigned to car $x$ (you can only move this car to this place), while the integer $0$ represents a empty space (you can't move any car to this place).\n\nIn the second and third line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents initial position of car $x$, while the integer $0$ represents an empty space (you can move any car to this place).\n\nEach $x$ between $1$ and $k$ appears exactly once in the second and third line, and exactly once in the first and fourth line.. Output specification: If there is a sequence of moves that brings all of the cars to their parking spaces, with at most $20000$ car moves, then print $m$, the number of moves, on the first line. On the following $m$ lines, print the moves (one move per line) in the format $i$ $r$ $c$, which corresponds to Allen moving car $i$ to the neighboring space at row $r$ and column $c$.\n\nIf it is not possible for Allen to move all the cars to the correct spaces with at most $20000$ car moves, print a single line with the integer $-1$.\nDemo input: ['4 5\\n1 2 0 4\\n1 2 0 4\\n5 0 0 3\\n0 5 0 3\\n', '1 2\\n1\\n2\\n1\\n2\\n', '1 2\\n1\\n1\\n2\\n2\\n'], Demo output: ['6\\n1 1 1\\n2 1 2\\n4 1 4\\n3 4 4\\n5 3 2\\n5 4 2\\n', '-1\\n', '2\\n1 1 1\\n2 4 1\\n']\nNote: In the first sample test case, all cars are in front of their spots except car $5$, which is in front of the parking spot adjacent. The example shows the shortest possible sequence of moves, but any sequence of length at most $20000$ will be accepted.\n\nIn the second sample test case, there is only one column, and the cars are in the wrong order, so no cars can move and the task is impossible."}]}}

So the cost of the whole flight is equal to 1. It's impossible to get to the olympiad for free, so the answer is equal to 1. \n\nIn the second example Vladik can fly directly from the airport 5 to the airport 2, because they belong to the same company."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: One day student Vasya was sitting on a lecture and mentioned a string *s*1*s*2... *s**n*, consisting of letters \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\" that was written on his desk. As the lecture was boring, Vasya decided to complete the picture by composing a graph *G* with the following properties: \n -  *G* has exactly *n* vertices, numbered from 1 to *n*. -  For all pairs of vertices *i* and *j*, where *i*<=\u2260<=*j*, there is an edge connecting them if and only if characters *s**i* and *s**j* are either equal or neighbouring in the alphabet. That is, letters in pairs \"a\"-\"b\" and \"b\"-\"c\" are neighbouring, while letters \"a\"-\"c\" are not. \nVasya painted the resulting graph near the string and then erased the string. Next day Vasya's friend Petya came to a lecture and found some graph at his desk. He had heard of Vasya's adventure and now he wants to find out whether it could be the original graph *G*, painted by Vasya. In order to verify this, Petya needs to know whether there exists a string *s*, such that if Vasya used this *s* he would produce the given graph *G*.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* \u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices and edges in the graph found by Petya, respectively.\n\nEach of the next *m* lines contains two integers *u**i* and *v**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*u**i*<=\u2260<=*v**i*)\u00a0\u2014 the edges of the graph *G*.

Write a python script for the following problem: For months Maxim has been coming to work on his favorite bicycle. And quite recently he decided that he is ready to take part in a cyclists' competitions.\n\nHe knows that this year *n* competitions will take place. During the *i*-th competition the participant must as quickly as possible complete a ride along a straight line from point *s**i* to point *f**i* (*s**i*<=&lt;<=*f**i*).\n\nMeasuring time is a complex process related to usage of a special sensor and a time counter. Think of the front wheel of a bicycle as a circle of radius *r*. Let's neglect the thickness of a tire, the size of the sensor, and all physical effects. The sensor is placed on the rim of the wheel, that is, on some fixed point on a circle of radius *r*. After that the counter moves just like the chosen point of the circle, i.e. moves forward and rotates around the center of the circle.\n\nAt the beginning each participant can choose any point *b**i*, such that his bike is fully behind the starting line, that is, *b**i*<=&lt;<=*s**i*<=-<=*r*. After that, he starts the movement, instantly accelerates to his maximum speed and at time *ts**i*, when the coordinate of the sensor is equal to the coordinate of the start, the time counter starts. The cyclist makes a complete ride, moving with his maximum speed and at the moment the sensor's coordinate is equal to the coordinate of the finish (moment of time *tf**i*), the time counter deactivates and records the final time. Thus, the counter records that the participant made a complete ride in time *tf**i*<=-<=*ts**i*.\n\nMaxim is good at math and he suspects that the total result doesn't only depend on his maximum speed *v*, but also on his choice of the initial point *b**i*. Now Maxim is asking you to calculate for each of *n* competitions the minimum possible time that can be measured by the time counter. The radius of the wheel of his bike is equal to *r*.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *r* and *v* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000,<=1<=\u2264<=*r*,<=*v*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 the number of competitions, the radius of the front wheel of Max's bike and his maximum speed, respectively. \n\nNext *n* lines contain the descriptions of the contests.

Write a python script for the following problem: The \"Bulls and Cows\" game needs two people to play. The thinker thinks of a number and the guesser tries to guess it.\n\nThe thinker thinks of a four-digit number in the decimal system. All the digits in the number are different and the number may have a leading zero. It can't have more than one leading zero, because all it's digits should be different. The guesser tries to guess the number. He makes a series of guesses, trying experimental numbers and receives answers from the first person in the format \"*x* bulls *y* cows\". *x* represents the number of digits in the experimental number that occupy the same positions as in the sought number. *y* represents the number of digits of the experimental number that present in the sought number, but occupy different positions. Naturally, the experimental numbers, as well as the sought number, are represented by four-digit numbers where all digits are different and a leading zero can be present.\n\nFor example, let's suppose that the thinker thought of the number 0123. Then the guessers' experimental number 1263 will receive a reply \"1 bull 2 cows\" (3 occupies the same positions in both numbers and 1 and 2 are present in both numbers but they occupy different positions). Also, the answer to number 8103 will be \"2 bulls 1 cow\" (analogically, 1 and 3 occupy the same positions and 0 occupies a different one). \n\nWhen the guesser is answered \"4 bulls 0 cows\", the game is over.\n\nNow the guesser has already made several guesses and wants to know whether his next guess can possibly be the last one.\nInput specification: The first input line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=10) which represents the number of already made guesses. Then follow *n* lines in the form of \"*a**i* *b**i* *c**i*\", where *a**i* is the *i*-th experimental number, *b**i* is the number of bulls, *c**i* is the number of cows (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*, 0<=\u2264<=*b**i*,<=*c**i*,<=*b**i*<=+<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=4). The experimental numbers are correct, i.e., each of them contains exactly four digits, in each of them all the four digits are different, and there can be a leading zero. All the experimental numbers are different. As the guesser hasn't guessed the number yet, the answer \"4 bulls 0 cows\" is not present.. Output specification: If the input data is enough to determine the sought number, print the number with four digits on a single line. If it has less than four digits, add leading zero.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Gargari is jealous that his friend Caisa won the game from the previous problem. He wants to prove that he is a genius.\n\nHe has a *n*<=\u00d7<=*n* chessboard. Each cell of the chessboard has a number written on it. Gargari wants to place two bishops on the chessboard in such a way that there is no cell that is attacked by both of them. Consider a cell with number *x* written on it, if this cell is attacked by one of the bishops Gargari will get *x* dollars for it. Tell Gargari, how to place bishops on the chessboard to get maximum amount of money.\n\nWe assume a cell is attacked by a bishop, if the cell is located on the same diagonal with the bishop (the cell, where the bishop is, also considered attacked by it).\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2000). Each of the next *n* lines contains *n* integers *a**ij* (0<=\u2264<=*a**ij*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 description of the chessboard..

The king has already sent the message to all knights in the kingdom and they in turn agreed to participate in this grand event.\n\nAs for you, you're just a simple peasant. There's no surprise that you slept in this morning and were late for the tournament (it was a weekend, after all). Now you are really curious about the results of the tournament. This time the tournament in Berland went as follows:\n -  There are *n* knights participating in the tournament. Each knight was assigned his unique number \u2014 an integer from 1 to *n*. -  The tournament consisted of *m* fights, in the *i*-th fight the knights that were still in the game with numbers at least *l**i* and at most *r**i* have fought for the right to continue taking part in the tournament. -  After the *i*-th fight among all participants of the fight only one knight won \u2014 the knight number *x**i*, he continued participating in the tournament. Other knights left the tournament. -  The winner of the last (the *m*-th) fight (the knight number *x**m*) became the winner of the tournament. \nYou fished out all the information about the fights from your friends. Now for each knight you want to know the name of the knight he was conquered by. We think that the knight number *b* was conquered by the knight number *a*, if there was a fight with both of these knights present and the winner was the knight number *a*.\n\nWrite the code that calculates for each knight, the name of the knight that beat him.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n*, *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of knights and the number of fights.

Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24.

The image is in black and white, therefore the color of each pixel will be an integer between 0 and 255 (inclusive).\n\nTo implement the filter, students are required to divide the black and white color range [0, 255] into groups of consecutive colors, and select one color in each group to be the group\u2019s key.

Find any way how to use private messages which satisfies requirements above.\nInput specification: The first line contains the positive integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of students. \n\nThe second line contains the sequence *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100), where *a**i* equals to the maximum number of messages which can the *i*-th student agree to send. Consider that Polycarp always has the number 1.. Output specification: Print -1 to the first line if it is impossible to inform all students about credit. \n\nOtherwise, in the first line print the integer *k* \u2014 the number of messages which will be sent. In each of the next *k* lines print two distinct integers *f* and *t*, meaning that the student number *f* sent the message with news to the student number *t*. All messages should be printed in chronological order. It means that the student, who is sending the message, must already know this news. It is assumed that students can receive repeated messages with news of the credit. \n\nIf there are several answers, it is acceptable to print any of them.\nDemo input: ['4\\n1 2 1 0\\n', '6\\n2 0 1 3 2 0\\n', '3\\n0 2 2\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n1 2\\n2 4\\n2 3\\n', '6\\n1 3\\n3 4\\n1 2\\n4 5\\n5 6\\n4 6\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: In the first test Polycarp (the student number 1) can send the message to the student number 2, who after that can send the message to students number 3 and 4. Thus, all students knew about the credit."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Byteland is trying to send a space mission onto the Bit-X planet. Their task is complicated by the fact that the orbit of the planet is regularly patrolled by Captain Bitonix, the leader of the space forces of Bit-X.\n\nThere are *n* stations around Bit-X numbered clockwise from 1 to *n*. The stations are evenly placed on a circular orbit, so the stations number *i* and *i*<=+<=1 (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*n*), and the stations number 1 and *n*, are neighboring. The distance between every pair of adjacent stations is equal to *m* space miles. To go on a patrol, Captain Bitonix jumps in his rocket at one of the stations and flies in a circle, covering a distance of at least one space mile, before finishing in some (perhaps the starting) station.\n\nBitonix' rocket moves by burning fuel tanks. After Bitonix attaches an *x*-liter fuel tank and chooses the direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise), the rocket flies exactly *x* space miles along a circular orbit in the chosen direction. Note that the rocket has no brakes; it is not possible for the rocket to stop before depleting a fuel tank.\n\nFor example, assume that *n*<==<=3 and *m*<==<=60 and Bitonix has fuel tanks with volumes of 10, 60, 90 and 100 liters. If Bitonix starts from station 1, uses the 100-liter fuel tank to go clockwise, then uses the 90-liter fuel tank to go clockwise, and then uses the 10-liter fuel tank to go counterclockwise, he will finish back at station 1. This constitutes a valid patrol. Note that Bitonix does not have to use all available fuel tanks. Another valid option for Bitonix in this example would be to simply use the 60-liter fuel tank to fly to either station 2 or 3.\n\nHowever, if *n* was equal to 3, *m* was equal to 60 and the only fuel tanks available to Bitonix were one 10-liter tank and one 100-liter tank, he would have no way of completing a valid patrol (he wouldn't be able to finish any patrol exactly at the station).\n\nThe Byteland space agency wants to destroy some of Captain Bitonix' fuel tanks so that he cannot to complete any valid patrol. Find how many different subsets of the tanks the agency can destroy to prevent Captain Bitonix from completing a patrol and output the answer modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains three integers *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the number of stations, *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=120) \u2014 the distance between adjacent stations, and *t* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=10000) \u2014 the number of fuel tanks owned by Captain Bitonix.\n\nThe second line of the input contains *t* space-separated integers between 1 and 109, inclusive \u2014 the volumes of Bitonix' fuel tanks.. Output specification: Output a single number \u2014 the number of distinct subsets of tanks that the Bytelandian space agency can destroy in order to prevent Captain Bitonix from completing a patrol, modulo 109<=+<=7.\nDemo input: ['7 6 5\\n5 4 12 6 5\\n', '3 60 2\\n10 100\\n'], Demo output: ['6\\n', '4\\n']\nNote: All the fuel tanks are distinct, even if some of them have the same capacity."}]}}

However becoming a trainee at the Citadel is not a cakewalk and hence the maesters at the Citadel gave Sam a problem to test his eligibility. \n\nInitially Sam has a list with a single element *n*. Then he has to perform certain operations on this list. In each operation Sam must remove any element *x*, such that *x*<=&gt;<=1, from the list and insert at the same position , ,  sequentially. He must continue with these operations until all the elements in the list are either 0 or 1.\n\nNow the masters want the total number of 1s in the range *l* to *r* (1-indexed). Sam wants to become a maester but unfortunately he cannot solve this problem. Can you help Sam to pass the eligibility test?\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *l*, *r* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=&lt;<=250, 0<=\u2264<=*r*<=-<=*l*<=\u2264<=105, *r*<=\u2265<=1, *l*<=\u2265<=1) \u2013 initial element and the range *l* to *r*.\n\nIt is guaranteed that *r* is not greater than the length of the final list.. Output specification: Output the total number of 1s in the range *l* to *r* in the final sequence.\nDemo input: ['7 2 5\\n', '10 3 10\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n', '5\\n']\nNote: Consider first example:\n\n<img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/288fbb682a6fa1934a47b763d6851f9d32a06150.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\nElements on positions from 2-nd to 5-th in list is [1,\u20091,\u20091,\u20091].

Write a python script for the following problem: Bob is a farmer. He has a large pasture with many sheep. Recently, he has lost some of them due to wolf attacks. He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.

Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

Two integers *l* and *r* (1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=*r*<=\u2264<=*n*) are specified\u00a0\u2014 bounds of query segment. 1.  Integers, presented in array segment [*l*,<=<=*r*] (in sequence of integers *a**l*,<=*a**l*<=+<=1,<=...,<=*a**r*) even number of times, are written down. 1.  XOR-sum of written down integers is calculated, and this value is the answer for a query. Formally, if integers written down in point 2 are *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**k*, then Mishka wants to know the value , where \u00a0\u2014 operator of exclusive bitwise OR. \nSince only the little bears know the definition of array beauty, all you are to do is to answer each of queries presented.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1<=000<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of elements in the array.\n\nThe second line of the input contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 array elements.\n\nThe third line of the input contains single integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=1<=000<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of queries.\n\nEach of the next *m* lines describes corresponding query by a pair of integers *l* and *r* (1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=*r*<=\u2264<=*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the bounds of query segment.. Output specification: Print *m* non-negative integers\u00a0\u2014 the answers for the queries in the order they appear in the input.\nDemo input: ['3\\n3 7 8\\n1\\n1 3\\n', '7\\n1 2 1 3 3 2 3\\n5\\n4 7\\n4 5\\n1 3\\n1 7\\n1 5\\n'], Demo output: ['0\\n', '0\\n3\\n1\\n3\\n2\\n']\nNote: In the second sample:\n\nThere is no integers in the segment of the first query, presented even number of times in the segment\u00a0\u2014 the answer is 0.\n\nIn the second query there is only integer 3 is presented even number of times\u00a0\u2014 the answer is 3.\n\nIn the third query only integer 1 is written down\u00a0\u2014 the answer is 1.\n\nIn the fourth query all array elements are considered. Only 1 and 2 are presented there even number of times. The answer is <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/8f3bf9fdacb25bb19b17c017c532cd102cb4993c.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>.\n\nIn the fifth query 1 and 3 are written down.

Space and time replaced each other.\n\nThe entire universe turned into an enormous clock face with three hands\u00a0\u2014 hour, minute, and second. Time froze, and clocks now show the time *h* hours, *m* minutes, *s* seconds.\n\nLast time Misha talked with the coordinator at *t*1 o'clock, so now he stands on the number *t*1 on the clock face. The contest should be ready by *t*2 o'clock. In the terms of paradox it means that Misha has to go to number *t*2 somehow. Note that he doesn't have to move forward only: in these circumstances time has no direction.\n\nClock hands are very long, and Misha cannot get round them. He also cannot step over as it leads to the collapse of space-time. That is, if hour clock points 12 and Misha stands at 11 then he cannot move to 1 along the top arc. He has to follow all the way round the clock center (of course, if there are no other hands on his way).\n\nGiven the hands' positions, *t*1, and *t*2, find if Misha can prepare the contest on time (or should we say on space?).

So the condition is satisfied if *x* is 1.\n\nThe process is similar for the second and the third person.\n\nIf the fourth person starts some round:\n\nThe fourth person calls himself and says \"Owwwf\", then he calls himself again and says \"Owwf\", then he calls himself for another time and says \"Owf\", so the fourth person becomes Joon-Joon of the round. So the condition is satisfied when *x* is 4.\n\nIn the last example if the first person starts a round, then the second person becomes the Joon-Joon, and vice versa."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: As we all know, Max is the best video game player among her friends. Her friends were so jealous of hers, that they created an actual game just to prove that she's not the best at games. The game is played on a directed acyclic graph (a DAG) with *n* vertices and *m* edges. There's a character written on each edge, a lowercase English letter.\n\nMax and Lucas are playing the game. Max goes first, then Lucas, then Max again and so on. Each player has a marble, initially located at some vertex. Each player in his/her turn should move his/her marble along some edge (a player can move the marble from vertex *v* to vertex *u* if there's an outgoing edge from *v* to *u*). If the player moves his/her marble from vertex *v* to vertex *u*, the \"character\" of that round is the character written on the edge from *v* to *u*.

Write a python script for the following problem: There are lots of theories concerning the origin of moon craters. Most scientists stick to the meteorite theory, which says that the craters were formed as a result of celestial bodies colliding with the Moon. The other version is that the craters were parts of volcanoes.\n\nAn extraterrestrial intelligence research specialist professor Okulov (the namesake of the Okulov, the author of famous textbooks on programming) put forward an alternate hypothesis. Guess what kind of a hypothesis it was \u2013\u2013 sure, the one including extraterrestrial mind involvement. Now the professor is looking for proofs of his hypothesis.\n\nProfessor has data from the moon robot that moves linearly in one direction along the Moon surface. The moon craters are circular in form with integer-valued radii. The moon robot records only the craters whose centers lay on his path and sends to the Earth the information on the distance from the centers of the craters to the initial point of its path and on the radii of the craters.\n\nAccording to the theory of professor Okulov two craters made by an extraterrestrial intelligence for the aims yet unknown either are fully enclosed one in the other or do not intersect at all. Internal or external tangency is acceptable. However the experimental data from the moon robot do not confirm this theory! Nevertheless, professor Okulov is hopeful. He perfectly understands that to create any logical theory one has to ignore some data that are wrong due to faulty measuring (or skillful disguise by the extraterrestrial intelligence that will be sooner or later found by professor Okulov!) That\u2019s why Okulov wants to choose among the available crater descriptions the largest set that would satisfy his theory.\nInput specification: The first line has an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2000) \u2014 the number of discovered craters. The next *n* lines contain crater descriptions in the \"*c**i* *r**i*\" format, where *c**i* is the coordinate of the center of the crater on the moon robot\u2019s path, *r**i* is the radius of the crater.

In the next line output space-separated numbers of craters that this set consists of. The craters are numbered from 1 to *n* in the order in which they were given in the input data.

Second, they divide one day in *n* hours, and each hour in *m* minutes. Personal watches of each robber are divided in two parts: first of them has the smallest possible number of places that is necessary to display any integer from 0 to *n*<=-<=1, while the second has the smallest possible number of places that is necessary to display any integer from 0 to *m*<=-<=1. Finally, if some value of hours or minutes can be displayed using less number of places in base 7 than this watches have, the required number of zeroes is added at the beginning of notation.\n\nNote that to display number 0 section of the watches is required to have at least one place.\n\nLittle robber wants to know the number of moments of time (particular values of hours and minutes), such that all digits displayed on the watches are distinct.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: For some time the program of rounding numbers that had been developed by the Codeforces participants during one of the previous rounds, helped the citizens of Far Far Away to convert numbers into a more easily readable format. However, as time went by, the economy of the Far Far Away developed and the scale of operations grew. So the King ordered to found the Bank of Far Far Away and very soon even the rounding didn't help to quickly determine even the order of the numbers involved in operations. Besides, rounding a number to an integer wasn't very convenient as a bank needed to operate with all numbers with accuracy of up to 0.01, and not up to an integer.\n\nThe King issued yet another order: to introduce financial format to represent numbers denoting amounts of money. The formal rules of storing a number in the financial format are as follows: \n -  A number contains the integer part and the fractional part. The two parts are separated with a character \".\" (decimal point). -  To make digits in the integer part of a number easier to read, they are split into groups of three digits, starting from the least significant ones. The groups are separated with the character \",\" (comma). For example, if the integer part of a number equals 12345678, then it will be stored in the financial format as 12,345,678 -  In the financial format a number's fractional part should contain exactly two digits. So, if the initial number (the number that is converted into the financial format) contains less than two digits in the fractional part (or contains no digits at all), it is complemented with zeros until its length equals 2. If the fractional part contains more than two digits, the extra digits are simply discarded (they are not rounded: see sample tests). -  When a number is stored in the financial format, the minus sign is not written. Instead, if the initial number had the minus sign, the result is written in round brackets. -  Please keep in mind that the bank of Far Far Away operates using an exotic foreign currency \u2014 snakes ($), that's why right before the number in the financial format we should put the sign \"$\". If the number should be written in the brackets, then the snake sign should also be inside the brackets. \nFor example, by the above given rules number 2012 will be stored in the financial format as \"$2,012.00\" and number -12345678.9 will be stored as \"($12,345,678.90)\".\n\nThe merchants of Far Far Away visited you again and expressed much hope that you supply them with the program that can convert arbitrary numbers to the financial format. Can you help them?\nInput specification: The input contains a number that needs to be converted into financial format. The number's notation length does not exceed 100 characters, including (possible) signs \"-\" (minus) and \".\" (decimal point). The number's notation is correct, that is: \n -  The number's notation only contains characters from the set {\"0\" \u2013 \"9\", \"-\", \".\"}. -  The decimal point (if it is present) is unique and is preceded and followed by a non-zero quantity on decimal digits -  A number cannot start with digit 0, except for a case when its whole integer part equals zero (in this case the integer parts is guaranteed to be a single zero: \"0\"). -  The minus sign (if it is present) is unique and stands in the very beginning of the number's notation -  If a number is identically equal to 0 (that is, if it is written as, for example, \"0\" or \"0.000\"), than it is not preceded by the minus sign. -  The input data contains no spaces. -  The number's notation contains at least one decimal digit.. Output specification: Print the number given in the input in the financial format by the rules described in the problem statement.\nDemo input: ['2012\\n', '0.000\\n', '-0.00987654321\\n', '-12345678.9\\n'], Demo output: ['$2,012.00', '$0.00', '($0.00)', '($12,345,678.90)']\nNote: Pay attention to the second and third sample tests. They show that the sign of a number in the financial format (and consequently, the presence or absence of brackets) is determined solely by the sign of the initial number. It does not depend on the sign of the number you got after translating the number to the financial format."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.

The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs.

Each word in his language is an adjective, noun or verb. -  There are two genders: masculine and feminine. Each word in his language has gender either masculine or feminine. -  Masculine adjectives end with -lios, and feminine adjectives end with -liala. -  Masculine nouns end with -etr, and feminime nouns end with -etra. -  Masculine verbs end with -initis, and feminime verbs end with -inites. -  Thus, each word in the Petya's language has one of the six endings, given above. There are no other endings in Petya's language. -  It is accepted that the whole word consists of an ending. That is, words \"lios\", \"liala\", \"etr\" and so on belong to the Petya's language. -  There aren't any punctuation marks, grammatical tenses, singular/plural forms or other language complications. -  A sentence is either exactly one valid language word or exactly one statement. \nStatement is any sequence of the Petya's language, that satisfy both conditions:\n-  Words in statement follow in the following order (from the left to the right): zero or more adjectives followed by exactly one noun followed by zero or more verbs. -  All words in the statement should have the same gender.\nAfter Petya's friend Vasya wrote instant messenger (an instant messaging program) that supported the Petya's language, Petya wanted to add spelling and grammar checking to the program.

When Toastman receives group [3, 5], he adds 8 to the score and gives the group to Appleman. Appleman splits [3, 5] in the only possible way: [5] and [3]. Then he gives both groups to Toastman. When Toastman receives [5], he adds 5 to the score and gives the group to Appleman (he will throws it out). When Toastman receives [3], he adds 3 to the score and gives the group to Appleman (he will throws it out). Finally Toastman have added 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 + 3 = 26 to the score.

Write a python script for the following problem: One day a well-known sponsor of a well-known contest decided to give every participant of the contest a T-shirt as a present. A natural problem occurred: on the one hand, it is not clear how many T-shirts of what sizes should be ordered, and on the other hand, one doesn't want to order too many T-shirts (and we do not exactly paper the walls with the oversupply). After considerable brain racking and some pre-estimating, the sponsor representatives ordered a certain number of T-shirts of sizes S, M, L, XL and XXL. The T-shirts turned out to bring good luck, that's why on the contest day there built up a line of *K* participants willing to get one. Every contestant is characterized by his/her desired T-shirt size (so it happens that for all the participants it is also one of the sizes S, M, L, XL and XXL). The participants come up to get a T-shirt one by one and try to choose the most suitable one, choosing it like this. If there is still a T-shirt of the optimal size left, that he/she takes it without further ado. Otherwise the contestant would prefer to choose a T-shirt with the size as close to the optimal one as possible (the distance between neighboring sizes is considered equal to one). If the variant of choice is not unique, the contestant will take a T-shirt of a bigger size (in case he/she grows more). For example, for a person whose optimal size is L the preference list looks like this: L, XL, M, XXL, S.

Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs.

Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: You've got a robot, its task is destroying bombs on a square plane. Specifically, the square plane contains *n* bombs, the *i*-th bomb is at point with coordinates (*x**i*,<=*y**i*). We know that no two bombs are at the same point and that no bomb is at point with coordinates (0,<=0). Initially, the robot is at point with coordinates (0,<=0). Also, let's mark the robot's current position as (*x*,<=*y*). In order to destroy all the bombs, the robot can perform three types of operations:\n 1.  Operation has format \"1 k dir\". To perform the operation robot have to move in direction *dir* *k* (*k*<=\u2265<=1) times. There are only 4 directions the robot can move in: \"R\", \"L\", \"U\", \"D\". During one move the robot can move from the current point to one of following points: (*x*<=+<=1,<=*y*), (*x*<=-<=1,<=*y*), (*x*,<=*y*<=+<=1), (*x*,<=*y*<=-<=1) (corresponding to directions). It is forbidden to move from point (*x*,<=*y*), if at least one point on the path (besides the destination point) contains a bomb. 1.  Operation has format \"2\". To perform the operation robot have to pick a bomb at point (*x*,<=*y*) and put it in a special container. Thus, the robot can carry the bomb from any point to any other point. The operation cannot be performed if point (*x*,<=*y*) has no bomb. It is forbidden to pick a bomb if the robot already has a bomb in its container. 1.  Operation has format \"3\". To perform the operation robot have to take a bomb out of the container and destroy it. You are allowed to perform this operation only if the robot is at point (0,<=0). It is forbidden to perform the operation if the container has no bomb. \nHelp the robot and find the shortest possible sequence of operations he can perform to destroy all bombs on the coordinate plane.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of bombs on the coordinate plane.
