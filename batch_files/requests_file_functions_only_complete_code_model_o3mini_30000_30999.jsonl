Complete the given code for the following problem: A string is a palindrome if it reads the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings \"kek\", \"abacaba\", \"r\" and \"papicipap\" are palindromes, while the strings \"abb\" and \"iq\" are not.\n\nA substring $s[l \\ldots r]$ ($1<=\\leq<=l<=\\leq<=r<=\\leq<=|s|$) of a string $s<==<=s_{1}s_{2} \\ldots s_{|s|}$ is the string $s_{l}s_{l<=+<=1} \\ldots s_{r}$.\n\nAnna does not like palindromes, so she makes her friends call her Ann.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Polycarp is currently developing a project in Vaja language and using a popular dependency management system called Vamen. From Vamen's point of view both Vaja project and libraries are treated projects for simplicity.\n\nA project in Vaja has its own uniqie non-empty name consisting of lowercase latin letters with length not exceeding 10 and version \u2014 positive integer from 1 to 106. Each project (keep in mind that it is determined by both its name and version) might depend on other projects. For sure, there are no cyclic dependencies.\n\nYou're given a list of project descriptions. The first of the given projects is the one being developed by Polycarp at this moment. Help Polycarp determine all projects that his project depends on (directly or via a certain chain). \n\nIt's possible that Polycarp's project depends on two different versions of some project. In this case collision resolving is applied, i.e. for each such project the system chooses the version that minimizes the distance from it to Polycarp's project. If there are several options, the newer (with the maximum version) is preferred. This version is considered actual; other versions and their dependencies are ignored.\n\nMore formal, choose such a set of projects of minimum possible size that the following conditions hold: \n -  Polycarp's project is chosen; -  Polycarp's project depends (directly or indirectly) on all other projects in the set; -  no two projects share the name; -  for each project *x* that some other project in the set depends on we have either *x* or some *y* with other version and shorter chain to Polycarp's project chosen. In case of ties the newer one is chosen. \nOutput all Polycarp's project's dependencies (Polycarp's project itself should't be printed) in lexicographical order.\nInput specification: The first line contains an only integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1<=000) \u2014 the number of projects in Vaja.\n\nThe following lines contain the project descriptions. Each project is described by a line consisting of its name and version separated by space. The next line gives the number of direct dependencies (from 0 to *n*<=-<=1) and the dependencies themselves (one in a line) in arbitrary order. Each dependency is specified by its name and version. The projects are also given in arbitrary order, but the first of them is always Polycarp's. Project descriptions are separated by one empty line. Refer to samples for better understanding.\n\nIt's guaranteed that there are no cyclic dependencies.. Output specification: Output all Polycarp's project's dependencies in lexicographical order.\nNote: The first sample is given in the pic below. Arrow from *A* to *B* means that *B* directly depends on *A*. Projects that Polycarp's project \u00aba\u00bb (version 3) depends on are painted black.\n\nThe second sample is again given in the pic below. Arrow from *A* to *B* means that *B* directly depends on *A*. Projects that Polycarp's project \u00abcodehorses\u00bb (version 5) depends on are paint it black.

Let's call two empty cells adjacent if they share a side.\n\nLet's call a connected component any non-extendible set of cells such that any two of them are connected by the path of adjacent cells.

You should do it for each impassable cell independently.\n\nThe answer should be printed as a matrix with *n* rows and *m* columns.

It will be much faster than writing character-by-character.\n\nAs input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n*,<=*m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the number of rows and columns in the field.\n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains *m* symbols: \".\" for empty cells, \"*\" for impassable cells.. Output specification: Print the answer as a matrix as described above. See the examples to precise the format of the output.\nNote: In first example, if we imagine that the central cell is empty then it will be included to component of size 5 (cross).

He has always had an artist inside him but his father forced him to study mechanical engineering.\n\nYesterday he spent all of his time cutting a giant piece of wood trying to make it look like a goose. Anyway, his dad found out that he was doing arts rather than studying mechanics and other boring subjects. He confronted Hag with the fact that he is a spoiled son that does not care about his future, and if he continues to do arts he will cut his 25 Lira monthly allowance.\n\nHag is trying to prove to his dad that the wooden piece is a project for mechanics subject. He also told his dad that the wooden piece is a strictly convex polygon with $n$ vertices.\n\nHag brought two pins and pinned the polygon with them in the $1$-st and $2$-nd vertices to the wall. His dad has $q$ queries to Hag of two types. \n -  $1$ $f$ $t$: pull a pin from the vertex $f$, wait for the wooden polygon to rotate under the gravity force (if it will rotate) and stabilize. And then put the pin in vertex $t$. -  $2$ $v$: answer what are the coordinates of the vertex $v$. \nPlease help Hag to answer his father's queries.\n\nYou can assume that the wood that forms the polygon has uniform density and the polygon has a positive thickness, same in all points. After every query of the 1-st type Hag's dad tries to move the polygon a bit and watches it stabilize again.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($3\\leq n \\leq 10\\,000$, $1 \\leq q \\leq 200000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices in the polygon and the number of queries.\n\nThe next $n$ lines describe the wooden polygon, the $i$-th line contains two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($|x_i|, |y_i|\\leq 10^8$)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the $i$-th vertex of the polygon. It is guaranteed that polygon is strictly convex and the vertices are given in the counter-clockwise order and all vertices are distinct.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe the queries, one per line. Each query starts with its type $1$ or $2$. Each query of the first type continues with two integers $f$ and $t$ ($1 \\le f, t \\le n$)\u00a0\u2014 the vertex the pin is taken from, and the vertex the pin is put to and the polygon finishes rotating. It is guaranteed that the vertex $f$ contains a pin.

The cities are numbered from $1$ to $n$.\n\nIt is known that, from the capital (the city with the number $1$), you can reach any other city by moving along the roads.\n\nThe President of Berland plans to improve the country's road network. The budget is enough to repair exactly $n-1$ roads. The President plans to choose a set of $n-1$ roads such that:\n -  it is possible to travel from the capital to any other city along the $n-1$ chosen roads, -  if $d_i$ is the number of roads needed to travel from the capital to city $i$, moving only along the $n-1$ chosen roads, then $d_1 + d_2 + \\dots + d_n$ is minimized (i.e. as minimal as possible). \nIn other words, the set of $n-1$ roads should preserve the connectivity of the country, and the sum of distances from city $1$ to all cities should be minimized (where you can only use the $n-1$ chosen roads).\n\nThe president instructed the ministry to prepare $k$ possible options to choose $n-1$ roads so that both conditions above are met.\n\nWrite a program that will find $k$ possible ways to choose roads for repair. If there are fewer than $k$ ways, then the program should output all possible valid ways to choose roads.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5, n-1 \\le m \\le 2\\cdot10^5, 1 \\le k \\le 2\\cdot10^5$), where $n$ is the number of cities in the country, $m$ is the number of roads and $k$ is the number of options to choose a set of roads for repair. It is guaranteed that $m \\cdot k \\le 10^6$.\n\nThe following $m$ lines describe the roads, one road per line. Each line contains two integers $a_i$, $b_i$ ($1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le n$, $a_i \\ne b_i$) \u2014 the numbers of the cities that the $i$-th road connects. There is at most one road between a pair of cities. The given set of roads is such that you can reach any city from the capital.. Output specification: Print $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le k$) \u2014 the number of ways to choose a set of roads for repair. Recall that you need to find $k$ different options; if there are fewer than $k$ of them, then you need to find all possible different valid options.\n\nIn the following $t$ lines, print the options, one per line. Print an option as a string of $m$ characters where the $j$-th character is equal to '1' if the $j$-th road is included in the option, and is equal to '0' if the road is not included. The roads should be numbered according to their order in the input. The options can be printed in any order. All the $t$ lines should be different.\n\nSince it is guaranteed that $m \\cdot k \\le 10^6$, the total length of all the $t$ lines will not exceed $10^6$.\n\nIf there are several answers, output any of them.\nNote: noneComplete the following code: ```python\nfrom collections import *\r\nfrom heapq import *\r\nfrom bisect import *\r\nfrom itertools import *\r\nfrom functools import *\r\nfrom math import *\r\nfrom string import *\r\nimport operator\r\n```"}]}}

They put multiple cards and on each one they wrote a letter, either 'A', or the letter 'B'. Then they began to remove the cards one by one from left to right, every time they removed a card with the letter 'A', Alice gave Bob all the fruits she had at that moment and took out of the bag as many apples and as many oranges as she had before. Thus the number of oranges and apples Alice had, did not change. If the card had written letter 'B', then Bob did the same, that is, he gave Alice all the fruit that he had, and took from the bag the same set of fruit. After the last card way removed, all the fruit in the bag were over.\n\nYou know how many oranges and apples was in the bag at first.

For example, string AAABAABBB should be replaced by string 3A1B2A3B, but cannot be replaced by 2A1A1B2A3B or by 3AB2A3B. See the samples for clarifications of the output format. The string that you print should consist of at most 106 characters. It is guaranteed that if the answer exists, its compressed representation exists, consisting of at most 106 characters. If there are several possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them.\n\nIf the sequence of cards that meet the problem statement does not not exist, print a single word Impossible.\nNote: In the first sample, if the row contained three cards with letter 'B', then Bob should give one apple to Alice three times. So, in the end of the game Alice has one orange and three apples, and Bob has one apple, in total it is one orange and four apples.\n\nIn second sample, there is no answer since one card is not enough for game to finish, and two cards will produce at least three apples or three oranges.\n\nIn the third sample, cards contain letters 'AB', so after removing the first card Bob has one orange and one apple, and after removal of second card Alice has two oranges and one apple.

Complete the given code for the following problem: You're a mikemon breeder currently in the middle of your journey to become a mikemon master. Your current obstacle is go through the infamous Biridian Forest.\n\nThe forest\n\nThe Biridian Forest is a two-dimensional grid consisting of *r* rows and *c* columns. Each cell in Biridian Forest may contain a tree, or may be vacant. A vacant cell may be occupied by zero or more mikemon breeders (there may also be breeders other than you in the forest). Mikemon breeders (including you) cannot enter cells with trees. One of the cells is designated as the exit cell.\n\nThe initial grid, including your initial position, the exit cell, and the initial positions of all other breeders, will be given to you. Here's an example of such grid (from the first example):\n\nMoves\n\nBreeders (including you) may move in the forest. In a single move, breeders may perform one of the following actions: \n -  Do nothing. -  Move from the current cell to one of the four adjacent cells (two cells are adjacent if they share a side). Note that breeders cannot enter cells with trees. -  If you are located on the exit cell, you may leave the forest. Only you can perform this move \u2014 all other mikemon breeders will never leave the forest by using this type of movement. \nAfter each time you make a single move, each of the other breeders simultaneously make a single move (the choice of which move to make may be different for each of the breeders).\n\nMikemon battle\n\nIf you and *t* (*t*<=&gt;<=0) mikemon breeders are located on the same cell, exactly *t* mikemon battles will ensue that time (since you will be battling each of those *t* breeders once). After the battle, all of those *t* breeders will leave the forest to heal their respective mikemons.\n\nNote that the moment you leave the forest, no more mikemon battles can ensue, even if another mikemon breeder move to the exit cell immediately after that. Also note that a battle only happens between you and another breeders \u2014 there will be no battle between two other breeders (there may be multiple breeders coexisting in a single cell).\n\nYour goal\n\nYou would like to leave the forest. In order to do so, you have to make a sequence of moves, ending with a move of the final type. Before you make any move, however, you post this sequence on your personal virtual idol Blog. Then, you will follow this sequence of moves faithfully.\n\nGoal of other breeders\n\nBecause you post the sequence in your Blog, the other breeders will all know your exact sequence of moves even before you make your first move. All of them will move in such way that will guarantee a mikemon battle with you, if possible. The breeders that couldn't battle you will do nothing.\n\nYour task\n\nPrint the minimum number of mikemon battles that you must participate in, assuming that you pick the sequence of moves that minimize this number. Note that you are not required to minimize the number of moves you make.\nInput specification: The first line consists of two integers: *r* and *c* (1<=\u2264<=*r*,<=*c*<=\u2264<=1000), denoting the number of rows and the number of columns in Biridian Forest. The next *r* rows will each depict a row of the map, where each character represents the content of a single cell: \n -  'T': A cell occupied by a tree. -  'S': An empty cell, and your starting position. There will be exactly one occurence of this in the map. -  'E': An empty cell, and where the exit is located. There will be exactly one occurence of this in the map. -  A digit (0-9): A cell represented by a digit X means that the cell is empty and is occupied by X breeders (in particular, if X is zero, it means that the cell is not occupied by any breeder). \nIt is guaranteed that it will be possible for you to go from your starting position to the exit cell through a sequence of moves.. Output specification: A single line denoted the minimum possible number of mikemon battles that you have to participate in if you pick a strategy that minimize this number.\nNote: The following picture illustrates the first example. The blue line denotes a possible sequence of moves that you should post in your blog:\n\nThe three breeders on the left side of the map will be able to battle you \u2014 the lone breeder can simply stay in his place until you come while the other two breeders can move to where the lone breeder is and stay there until you come. The three breeders on the right does not have a way to battle you, so they will stay in their place.\n\nFor the second example, you should post this sequence in your Blog:\n\nHere's what happens. First, you move one cell to the right.\n\nThen, the two breeders directly to the right of the exit will simultaneously move to the left. The other three breeder cannot battle you so they will do nothing.\n\nYou end up in the same cell with 2 breeders, so 2 mikemon battles are conducted. After those battles, all of your opponents leave the forest.\n\nFinally, you make another move by leaving the forest.Complete the following code: ```python\ndef solve(f):\r\n\r\n    queue = []\r\n    flag = False\r\n    visited = [[False for _ in range(c)] for _ in range(r)]\r\n    \r\n    for i in range(r):\r\n        for j in range(c):\r\n```"}]}}

You can generate some random math statement or modify some theorems to get something new and build a new task from that.\n\nFor example, there is a statement called the \"Goldbach's conjecture\". It says: \"each even number no less than four can be expressed as the sum of two primes\". Let's modify it. How about a statement like that: \"each integer no less than 12 can be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers.\" Not like the Goldbach's conjecture, I can prove this theorem.\n\nYou are given an integer *n* no less than 12, express it as a sum of two composite numbers.\nInput specification: The only line contains an integer *n* (12<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=106)..

The time to enjoy those around them is so little that some even stand in queues to several rooms at the same time in the clinic, running from one queue to another.\n\n(Cultural note: standing in huge and disorganized queues for hours is a native tradition in Russia, dating back to the Soviet period. Queues can resemble crowds rather than lines. Not to get lost in such a queue, a person should follow a strict survival technique: you approach the queue and ask who the last person is, somebody answers and you join the crowd. Now you're the last person in the queue till somebody else shows up. You keep an eye on the one who was last before you as he is your only chance to get to your destination) I'm sure many people have had the problem when a stranger asks who the last person in the queue is and even dares to hint that he will be the last in the queue and then bolts away to some unknown destination. These are the representatives of the modern world, in which the ratio of lack of time is so great that they do not even watch foreign top-rated TV series. Such people often create problems in queues, because the newcomer does not see the last person in the queue and takes a place after the \"virtual\" link in this chain, wondering where this legendary figure has left.\n\nThe Smart Beaver has been ill and he's made an appointment with a therapist. The doctor told the Beaver the sad news in a nutshell: it is necessary to do an electrocardiogram.

He came up to each beaver in the ECG room queue and asked who should be in front of him in the queue. If the beaver did not know his correct position in the queue, then it might be his turn to go get an ECG, or maybe he should wait for a long, long time...\n\nAs you've guessed, the Smart Beaver was in a hurry home, so he gave you all the necessary information for you to help him to determine what his number in the queue can be.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=103) and *x* (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of beavers that stand in the queue and the Smart Beaver's number, correspondingly.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.\n\nShop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following *n* days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in *i*-th day *k**i* products will be put up for sale and exactly *l**i* clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any *f* days from *n* next for sell-outs. On each of *f* chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on *i*-th day shop planned to put up for sale *k**i* products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7*k**i* products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.\n\nNoora's task is to choose *f* days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *f* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105,<=0<=\u2264<=*f*<=\u2264<=*n*) denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.\n\nEach line of the following *n* subsequent lines contains two integers *k**i*,<=*l**i* (0<=\u2264<=*k**i*,<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=109) denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the *i*-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on *i*-th day.. Output specification: Print a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.\nNote: In the first example we can choose days with numbers 2 and 4 for sell-out. In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2,\u20096,\u20092,\u20092] respectively. So on the first day shop will sell 1 product, on the second\u00a0\u2014 5, on the third\u00a0\u2014 2, on the fourth\u00a0\u2014 2. In total 1\u2009+\u20095\u2009+\u20092\u2009+\u20092\u2009=\u200910 product units.\n\nIn the second example it is possible to sell 5 products, if you choose third day for sell-out.Complete the following code: ```python\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\nimport math\n\ndef inpit(): #int\n    return(int(input()))\ndef inplt(): #list \n    return(list(map(int,input().split())))\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: Little Nastya has a hobby, she likes to remove some letters from word, to obtain another word. But it turns out to be pretty hard for her, because she is too young. Therefore, her brother Sergey always helps her.\n\nSergey gives Nastya the word *t* and wants to get the word *p* out of it. Nastya removes letters in a certain order (one after another, in this order strictly), which is specified by permutation of letters' indices of the word *t*: *a*1... *a*|*t*|. We denote the length of word *x* as |*x*|. Note that after removing one letter, the indices of other letters don't change. For example, if *t*<==<=\"nastya\" and *a*<==<=[4,<=1,<=5,<=3,<=2,<=6] then removals make the following sequence of words \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\".\n\nSergey knows this permutation. His goal is to stop his sister at some point and continue removing by himself to get the word *p*. Since Nastya likes this activity, Sergey wants to stop her as late as possible. Your task is to determine, how many letters Nastya can remove before she will be stopped by Sergey.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the word *p* can be obtained by removing the letters from word *t*.\nInput specification: The first and second lines of the input contain the words *t* and *p*, respectively. Words are composed of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet (1<=\u2264<=|*p*|<=&lt;<=|*t*|<=\u2264<=200<=000). It is guaranteed that the word *p* can be obtained by removing the letters from word *t*.\n\nNext line contains a permutation *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a*|*t*| of letter indices that specifies the order in which Nastya removes letters of *t* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=|*t*|, all *a**i* are distinct).. Output specification: Print a single integer number, the maximum number of letters that Nastya can remove.\nNote: In the first sample test sequence of removing made by Nastya looks like this:\n\n\"ababcba\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ababcba\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ababcba\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ababcba\" \n\nNastya can not continue, because it is impossible to get word \"abb\" from word \"ababcba\".\n\nSo, Nastya will remove only three letters.Complete the following code: ```python\ndef isIn(string, sub):\r\n    index = 0\r\n    for c in sub:\r\n        index = string.find(c, index)\r\n        if index == -1:\r\n            return False\r\n    return True\r\n```"}]}}

The grandmother has a large garden, which can be represented as a rectangle 1<=\u00d7<=*n* in size, when viewed from above. This rectangle is divided into *n* equal square sections. The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.\n\nCreating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section. At that, the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section. That is, for example, the garden can be represented by a 1<=\u00d7<=5 rectangle, where the section heights are equal to 4, 2, 3, 3, 2. Then if we create an artificial rain over any of the sections with the height of 3, the water will flow over all the sections, except the ones with the height of 4. See the illustration of this example at the picture:\n\nAs Petya is keen on programming, he decided to find such a section that if we create artificial rain above it, the number of watered sections will be maximal.

Bob decided to draw such a triangle immediately: on a sheet of paper he drew three points with integer coordinates, and joined them with segments of straight lines, then he showed the triangle to Peter. Peter said that Bob's triangle is not right-angled, but is almost right-angled: the triangle itself is not right-angled, but it is possible to move one of the points exactly by distance 1 so, that all the coordinates remain integer, and the triangle become right-angled. Bob asks you to help him and find out if Peter tricks him. By the given coordinates of the triangle you should find out if it is right-angled, almost right-angled, or neither of these.\nInput specification: The first input line contains 6 space-separated integers *x*1,<=*y*1,<=*x*2,<=*y*2,<=*x*3,<=*y*3 \u2014 coordinates of the triangle's vertices. All the coordinates are integer and don't exceed 100 in absolute value. It's guaranteed that the triangle is nondegenerate, i.e. its total area is not zero.. Output specification: If the given triangle is right-angled, output RIGHT, if it is almost right-angled, output ALMOST, and if it is neither of these, output NEITHER.\nNote: noneComplete the following code: ```python\ndef L(a, b): return (a[0] - b[0]) ** 2 + (a[1] - b[1]) ** 2\r\ndef M(a, b): return ((a[0] + b[0]) / 2, (a[1] + b[1]) / 2)\r\ndef D(a, b): return -0.00001 < a - b < 0.00001\r\n```"}]}}

Each of the cupboards has two doors: the left one and the right one. Karlsson remembers that when he rushed to the kitchen, all the cupboards' left doors were in the same position (open or closed), similarly, all the cupboards' right doors were in the same position (open or closed). Karlsson wants the doors to meet this condition as well by the time the family returns. Karlsson does not remember the position of all the left doors, also, he cannot remember the position of all the right doors. Therefore, it does not matter to him in what position will be all left or right doors. It is important to leave all the left doors in the same position, and all the right doors in the same position.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Complete the given code for the following problem: Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$.. Output specification: Print the only integer \u2014 maximum possible total time when the lamp is lit.\nNote: In the first example, one of possible optimal solutions is to insert value $x = 3$ before $a_1$, so program will be $[3, 4, 6, 7]$ and time of lamp being lit equals $(3 - 0) + (6 - 4) + (10 - 7) = 8$. Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$.Complete the following code: ```python\nimport copy\r\ndef Time(x):\r\n    time = 0\r\n    for i in range(0,len(x),2):\r\n        try:\r\n            time += x[i+1]-x[i]\r\n        except:\r\n            break\r\n```"}]}}

They are going to compete in a race with a distance of *L* meters today.\n\nWillman and Bolt have exactly the same speed, so when they compete the result is always a tie. That is a problem for the organizers because they want a winner. \n\nWhile watching previous races the organizers have noticed that Willman can perform only steps of length equal to *w* meters, and Bolt can perform only steps of length equal to *b* meters. Organizers decided to slightly change the rules of the race. Now, at the end of the racetrack there will be an abyss, and the winner will be declared the athlete, who manages to run farther from the starting point of the the racetrack (which is not the subject to change by any of the athletes). \n\nNote that none of the athletes can run infinitely far, as they both will at some moment of time face the point, such that only one step further will cause them to fall in the abyss. In other words, the athlete will not fall into the abyss if the total length of all his steps will be less or equal to the chosen distance *L*.\n\nSince the organizers are very fair, the are going to set the length of the racetrack as an integer chosen randomly and uniformly in range from 1 to *t* (both are included).

Dumbledore got fired and now Harry is trying to enter the Chamber of Secrets. These aren't good news for Lord Voldemort. The problem is, he doesn't want anybody to be able to enter the chamber. The Dark Lord is going to be busy sucking life out of Ginny.\n\nThe Chamber of Secrets is an *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* rectangular grid in which some of the cells are columns. A light ray (and a basilisk's gaze) passes through the columns without changing its direction. But with some spell we can make a column magic to reflect the light ray (or the gaze) in all four directions when it receives the ray. This is shown in the figure below.\n\nThe basilisk is located at the right side of the lower right cell of the grid and is looking to the left (in the direction of the lower left cell). According to the legend, anyone who meets a basilisk's gaze directly dies immediately. But if someone meets a basilisk's gaze through a column, this person will get petrified. We know that the door to the Chamber is located on the left side of the upper left corner of the grid and anyone who wants to enter will look in the direction of its movement (in the direction of the upper right cell) from that position.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the chamber and the location of regular columns, Lord Voldemort has asked you to find the minimum number of columns that we need to make magic so that anyone who wants to enter the chamber would be petrified or just declare that it's impossible to secure the chamber.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integer numbers *n* and *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000).

Unfortunately, the park has some spiders and Om Nom doesn't want to see them at all.\n\nThe park can be represented as a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The park has *k* spiders, each spider at time 0 is at some cell of the field. The spiders move all the time, and each spider always moves in one of the four directions (left, right, down, up). In a unit of time, a spider crawls from his cell to the side-adjacent cell in the corresponding direction. If there is no cell in the given direction, then the spider leaves the park. The spiders do not interfere with each other as they move. Specifically, one cell can have multiple spiders at the same time.\n\nOm Nom isn't yet sure where to start his walk from but he definitely wants:\n -  to start walking at time 0 at an upper row cell of the field (it is guaranteed that the cells in this row do not contain any spiders); -  to walk by moving down the field towards the lowest row (the walk ends when Om Nom leaves the boundaries of the park). \nWe know that Om Nom moves by jumping. One jump takes one time unit and transports the little monster from his cell to either a side-adjacent cell on the lower row or outside the park boundaries.\n\nEach time Om Nom lands in a cell he sees all the spiders that have come to that cell at this moment of time. Om Nom wants to choose the optimal cell to start the walk from. That's why he wonders: for each possible starting cell, how many spiders will he see during the walk if he starts from this cell? Help him and calculate the required value for each possible starting cell.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*,<=*m*,<=*k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=2000;\u00a00<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*m*(*n*<=-<=1)). \n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains *m* characters \u2014 the description of the park. The characters in the *i*-th line describe the *i*-th row of the park field. If the character in the line equals \".\", that means that the corresponding cell of the field is empty; otherwise, the character in the line will equal one of the four characters: \"L\" (meaning that this cell has a spider at time 0, moving left), \"R\" (a spider moving right), \"U\" (a spider moving up), \"D\" (a spider moving down). \n\nIt is guaranteed that the first row doesn't contain any spiders. It is guaranteed that the description of the field contains no extra characters. It is guaranteed that at time 0 the field contains exactly *k* spiders.. Output specification: Print *m* integers: the *j*-th integer must show the number of spiders Om Nom will see if he starts his walk from the *j*-th cell of the first row. The cells in any row of the field are numbered from left to right.\nNote: Consider the first sample. The notes below show how the spider arrangement changes on the field over time:\n\nCharacter \"*\" represents a cell that contains two spiders at the same time.\n -  If Om Nom starts from the first cell of the first row, he won't see any spiders. -  If he starts from the second cell, he will see two spiders at time 1. -  If he starts from the third cell, he will see two spiders: one at time 1, the other one at time 2.Complete the following code: ```python\n\"\"\"\nhttps://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/436/B\n\"\"\"\nfrom copy import deepcopy\n\ndeplacement = {\"L\": (0, -1), \"R\": (0, 1), \"U\": (-1, 0), \"D\": (1, 0)}\nspid_0 = {\"R\": [], \"L\": [], \"U\": [], \"D\": []}\nspiders = deepcopy(spid_0)\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: You're a mikemon breeder currently in the middle of your journey to become a mikemon master. Your current obstacle is go through the infamous Biridian Forest.\n\nThe forest\n\nThe Biridian Forest is a two-dimensional grid consisting of *r* rows and *c* columns. Each cell in Biridian Forest may contain a tree, or may be vacant. A vacant cell may be occupied by zero or more mikemon breeders (there may also be breeders other than you in the forest). Mikemon breeders (including you) cannot enter cells with trees. One of the cells is designated as the exit cell.\n\nThe initial grid, including your initial position, the exit cell, and the initial positions of all other breeders, will be given to you. Here's an example of such grid (from the first example):\n\nMoves\n\nBreeders (including you) may move in the forest. In a single move, breeders may perform one of the following actions: \n -  Do nothing. -  Move from the current cell to one of the four adjacent cells (two cells are adjacent if they share a side). Note that breeders cannot enter cells with trees. -  If you are located on the exit cell, you may leave the forest. Only you can perform this move \u2014 all other mikemon breeders will never leave the forest by using this type of movement. \nAfter each time you make a single move, each of the other breeders simultaneously make a single move (the choice of which move to make may be different for each of the breeders).\n\nMikemon battle\n\nIf you and *t* (*t*<=&gt;<=0) mikemon breeders are located on the same cell, exactly *t* mikemon battles will ensue that time (since you will be battling each of those *t* breeders once). After the battle, all of those *t* breeders will leave the forest to heal their respective mikemons.\n\nNote that the moment you leave the forest, no more mikemon battles can ensue, even if another mikemon breeder move to the exit cell immediately after that. Also note that a battle only happens between you and another breeders \u2014 there will be no battle between two other breeders (there may be multiple breeders coexisting in a single cell).\n\nYour goal\n\nYou would like to leave the forest. In order to do so, you have to make a sequence of moves, ending with a move of the final type. Before you make any move, however, you post this sequence on your personal virtual idol Blog. Then, you will follow this sequence of moves faithfully.\n\nGoal of other breeders\n\nBecause you post the sequence in your Blog, the other breeders will all know your exact sequence of moves even before you make your first move. All of them will move in such way that will guarantee a mikemon battle with you, if possible. The breeders that couldn't battle you will do nothing.\n\nYour task\n\nPrint the minimum number of mikemon battles that you must participate in, assuming that you pick the sequence of moves that minimize this number. Note that you are not required to minimize the number of moves you make.\nInput specification: The first line consists of two integers: *r* and *c* (1<=\u2264<=*r*,<=*c*<=\u2264<=1000), denoting the number of rows and the number of columns in Biridian Forest. The next *r* rows will each depict a row of the map, where each character represents the content of a single cell: \n -  'T': A cell occupied by a tree. -  'S': An empty cell, and your starting position. There will be exactly one occurence of this in the map. -  'E': An empty cell, and where the exit is located. There will be exactly one occurence of this in the map. -  A digit (0-9): A cell represented by a digit X means that the cell is empty and is occupied by X breeders (in particular, if X is zero, it means that the cell is not occupied by any breeder). \nIt is guaranteed that it will be possible for you to go from your starting position to the exit cell through a sequence of moves.. Output specification: A single line denoted the minimum possible number of mikemon battles that you have to participate in if you pick a strategy that minimize this number.\nNote: The following picture illustrates the first example. The blue line denotes a possible sequence of moves that you should post in your blog:\n\nThe three breeders on the left side of the map will be able to battle you \u2014 the lone breeder can simply stay in his place until you come while the other two breeders can move to where the lone breeder is and stay there until you come. The three breeders on the right does not have a way to battle you, so they will stay in their place.\n\nFor the second example, you should post this sequence in your Blog:\n\nHere's what happens. First, you move one cell to the right.\n\nThen, the two breeders directly to the right of the exit will simultaneously move to the left. The other three breeder cannot battle you so they will do nothing.\n\nYou end up in the same cell with 2 breeders, so 2 mikemon battles are conducted. After those battles, all of your opponents leave the forest.\n\nFinally, you make another move by leaving the forest.Complete the following code: ```python\n# https://codeforces.com/contest/329/problem/B\r\n\r\nfrom collections import deque\r\n\r\n# Direction vectors\r\nd_row = [ -1, 0, 1, 0]\r\nd_col = [ 0, 1, 0, -1]\r\n\r\n```"}]}}

As soon as one of the players scores *t* points, he wins the set; then the next set starts and scores of both players are being set to 0.

Here *s* and *t* are some positive integer numbers.\n\nTo spice it up, Petya and Gena choose new numbers *s* and *t* before every match. Besides, for the sake of history they keep a record of each match: that is, for each serve they write down the winner. Serve winners are recorded in the chronological order. In a record the set is over as soon as one of the players scores *t* points and the match is over as soon as one of the players wins *s* sets.\n\nPetya and Gena have found a record of an old match.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Sasha is taking part in a programming competition. In one of the problems she should check if some rooted trees are isomorphic or not. She has never seen this problem before, but, being an experienced participant, she guessed that she should match trees to some sequences and then compare these sequences instead of trees. Sasha wants to match each tree with a sequence *a*0,<=*a*1,<=...,<=*a**h*, where *h* is the height of the tree, and *a**i* equals to the number of vertices that are at distance of *i* edges from root. \n\nUnfortunately, this time Sasha's intuition was wrong, and there could be several trees matching the same sequence. To show it, you need to write a program that, given the sequence *a**i*, builds two non-isomorphic rooted trees that match that sequence, or determines that there is only one such tree.\n\nTwo rooted trees are isomorphic, if you can reenumerate the vertices of the first one in such a way, that the index of the root becomes equal the index of the root of the second tree, and these two trees become equal.\n\nThe height of a rooted tree is the maximum number of edges on a path from the root to any other vertex.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *h* (2<=\u2264<=*h*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the height of the tree.\n\nThe second line contains *h*<=+<=1 integers\u00a0\u2014 the sequence *a*0,<=*a*1,<=...,<=*a**h* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105).

Complete the given code for the following problem: Valentin participates in a show called \"Shockers\". The rules are quite easy: jury selects one letter which Valentin doesn't know. He should make a small speech, but every time he pronounces a word that contains the selected letter, he receives an electric shock. He can make guesses which letter is selected, but for each incorrect guess he receives an electric shock too. The show ends when Valentin guesses the selected letter correctly.\n\nValentin can't keep in mind everything, so he could guess the selected letter much later than it can be uniquely determined and get excessive electric shocks. Excessive electric shocks are those which Valentin got after the moment the selected letter can be uniquely determined. You should find out the number of excessive electric shocks.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of actions Valentin did.\n\nThe next *n* lines contain descriptions of his actions, each line contains description of one action. Each action can be of one of three types: \n 1.  Valentin pronounced some word and didn't get an electric shock. This action is described by the string \". w\" (without quotes), in which \".\" is a dot (ASCII-code 46), and *w* is the word that Valentin said. 1.  Valentin pronounced some word and got an electric shock. This action is described by the string \"! w\" (without quotes), in which \"!\" is an exclamation mark (ASCII-code 33), and *w* is the word that Valentin said. 1.  Valentin made a guess about the selected letter. This action is described by the string \"? s\" (without quotes), in which \"?\" is a question mark (ASCII-code 63), and *s* is the guess\u00a0\u2014 a lowercase English letter. \nAll words consist only of lowercase English letters. The total length of all words does not exceed 105.\n\nIt is guaranteed that last action is a guess about the selected letter. Also, it is guaranteed that Valentin didn't make correct guesses about the selected letter before the last action. Moreover, it's guaranteed that if Valentin got an electric shock after pronouncing some word, then it contains the selected letter; and also if Valentin didn't get an electric shock after pronouncing some word, then it does not contain the selected letter.. Output specification: Output a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of electric shocks that Valentin could have avoided if he had told the selected letter just after it became uniquely determined.\nNote: In the first test case after the first action it becomes clear that the selected letter is one of the following: *a*,\u2009*b*,\u2009*c*. After the second action we can note that the selected letter is not *a*. Valentin tells word \"b\" and doesn't get a shock. After that it is clear that the selected letter is *c*, but Valentin pronounces the word *cd* and gets an excessive electric shock. \n\nIn the second test case after the first two electric shocks we understand that the selected letter is *e* or *o*. Valentin tries some words consisting of these letters and after the second word it's clear that the selected letter is *e*, but Valentin makes 3 more actions before he makes a correct hypothesis.\n\nIn the third example the selected letter can be uniquely determined only when Valentin guesses it, so he didn't get excessive electric shocks.Complete the following code: ```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    alphas = list(map(lambda i: chr(i + ord('a')), range(0, 26)))\n    se = set(alphas)\n    count = 0\n    excess = 0\n```"}]}}

Vasya had only to answer whether it is in equilibrium. \"Piece of cake\" \u2014 thought Vasya, we need only to check if the sum of all vectors is equal to 0. So, Vasya began to solve the problem. But later it turned out that there can be lots and lots of these forces, and Vasya can not cope without your help. Help him. Write a program that determines whether a body is idle or is moving by the given vectors of forces.\nInput specification: The first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), then follow *n* lines containing three integers each: the *x**i* coordinate, the *y**i* coordinate and the *z**i* coordinate of the force vector, applied to the body (<=-<=100<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*,<=*z**i*<=\u2264<=100)..

Complete the given code for the following problem: You've got a robot, its task is destroying bombs on a square plane. Specifically, the square plane contains *n* bombs, the *i*-th bomb is at point with coordinates (*x**i*,<=*y**i*). We know that no two bombs are at the same point and that no bomb is at point with coordinates (0,<=0). Initially, the robot is at point with coordinates (0,<=0). Also, let's mark the robot's current position as (*x*,<=*y*). In order to destroy all the bombs, the robot can perform three types of operations:\n 1.  Operation has format \"1 k dir\". To perform the operation robot have to move in direction *dir* *k* (*k*<=\u2265<=1) times. There are only 4 directions the robot can move in: \"R\", \"L\", \"U\", \"D\". During one move the robot can move from the current point to one of following points: (*x*<=+<=1,<=*y*), (*x*<=-<=1,<=*y*), (*x*,<=*y*<=+<=1), (*x*,<=*y*<=-<=1) (corresponding to directions). It is forbidden to move from point (*x*,<=*y*), if at least one point on the path (besides the destination point) contains a bomb. 1.  Operation has format \"2\". To perform the operation robot have to pick a bomb at point (*x*,<=*y*) and put it in a special container. Thus, the robot can carry the bomb from any point to any other point. The operation cannot be performed if point (*x*,<=*y*) has no bomb. It is forbidden to pick a bomb if the robot already has a bomb in its container. 1.  Operation has format \"3\". To perform the operation robot have to take a bomb out of the container and destroy it. You are allowed to perform this operation only if the robot is at point (0,<=0). It is forbidden to perform the operation if the container has no bomb. \nHelp the robot and find the shortest possible sequence of operations he can perform to destroy all bombs on the coordinate plane.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of bombs on the coordinate plane.

So it's a necessity to not let any uninvited guests in.\n\nThere are 26 entrances in Jelly Castle, enumerated with uppercase English letters from A to Z. Because of security measures, each guest is known to be assigned an entrance he should enter the castle through. The door of each entrance is opened right before the first guest's arrival and closed right after the arrival of the last guest that should enter the castle through this entrance. No two guests can enter the castle simultaneously.\n\nFor an entrance to be protected from possible intrusion, a candy guard should be assigned to it. There are *k* such guards in the castle, so if there are more than *k* opened doors, one of them is going to be left unguarded!

You should also know that Limak is so young that he knows only first six letters of the English alphabet: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' and 'f'.\n\nYou are given a set of *q* possible operations. Limak can perform them in any order, any operation may be applied any number of times. The *i*-th operation is described by a string *a**i* of length two and a string *b**i* of length one. No two of *q* possible operations have the same string *a**i*.\n\nWhen Limak has a string *s* he can perform the *i*-th operation on *s* if the first two letters of *s* match a two-letter string *a**i*. Performing the *i*-th operation removes first two letters of *s* and inserts there a string *b**i*. See the notes section for further clarification.\n\nYou may note that performing an operation decreases the length of a string *s* exactly by 1. Also, for some sets of operations there may be a string that cannot be compressed any further, because the first two letters don't match any *a**i*.\n\nLimak wants to start with a string of length *n* and perform *n*<=-<=1 operations to finally get a one-letter string \"a\". In how many ways can he choose the starting string to be able to get \"a\"?

It's guaranteed that *a**i*<=\u2260<=*a**j* for *i*<=\u2260<=*j* and that all *a**i* and *b**i* consist of only first six lowercase English letters.. Output specification: Print the number of strings of length *n* that Limak will be able to transform to string \"a\" by applying only operations given in the input.\nNote: In the first sample, we count initial strings of length 3 from which Limak can get a required string \"a\". There are 4 such strings: \"abb\", \"cab\", \"cca\", \"eea\". The first one Limak can compress using operation 1 two times (changing \"ab\" to a single \"a\").

As there are many cookies, Olga decided that it's no big deal if she steals a bag. However, she doesn't want the sisters to quarrel because of nothing when they divide the cookies. That's why Olga wants to steal a bag with cookies so that the number of cookies in the remaining bags was even, that is, so that Anna and Maria could evenly divide it into two (even 0 remaining cookies will do, just as any other even number). How many ways there are to steal exactly one cookie bag so that the total number of cookies in the remaining bags was even?\nInput specification: The first line contains the only integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of cookie bags Anna and Maria have.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Vasya learns to type. He has an unusual keyboard at his disposal: it is rectangular and it has *n* rows of keys containing *m* keys in each row. Besides, the keys are of two types. Some of the keys have lowercase Latin letters on them and some of the keys work like the \"Shift\" key on standard keyboards, that is, they make lowercase letters uppercase.\n\nVasya can press one or two keys with one hand. However, he can only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the keys does not exceed *x*. The keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.\n\nVasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest \"Shift\" key is strictly larger than *x*. In this case he will have to use his other hand. Having typed the symbol, Vasya returns other hand back to the chips.\n\nYou are given Vasya's keyboard and the text. Count the minimum number of times Vasya will have to use the other hand.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *x* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=30,<=1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=50).\n\nNext *n* lines contain descriptions of all the keyboard keys. Each line contains the descriptions of exactly *m* keys, without spaces. The letter keys are marked with the corresponding lowercase letters. The \"Shift\" keys are marked with the \"S\" symbol. \n\nThen follow the length of the text *q* (1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=5\u00b7105). The last line contains the text *T*, which consists of *q* symbols, which are uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.. Output specification: If Vasya can type the text, then print the minimum number of times he will have to use his other hand. Otherwise, print \"-1\" (without the quotes).\nNote: In the first sample the symbol \"A\" is impossible to print as there's no \"Shift\" key on the keyboard.\n\nIn the second sample the symbol \"e\" is impossible to print as there's no such key on the keyboard.\n\nIn the fourth sample the symbols \"T\", \"G\" are impossible to print with one hand. The other letters that are on the keyboard can be printed.

Recently, Valya took offense at her boyfriend because he came to her in t-shirt with lettering that differs from lettering on her pullover. Now she doesn't want to see him and Tolya is seating at his room and crying at her photos all day long.\n\nThis story could be very sad but fairy godmother (Tolya's grandmother) decided to help them and restore their relationship. She secretly took Tolya's t-shirt and Valya's pullover and wants to make the letterings on them same. In order to do this, for one unit of mana she can buy a spell that can change some letters on the clothes. Your task is calculate the minimum amount of mana that Tolya's grandmother should spend to rescue love of Tolya and Valya.\n\nMore formally, letterings on Tolya's t-shirt and Valya's pullover are two strings with same length *n* consisting only of lowercase English letters. Using one unit of mana, grandmother can buy a spell of form (*c*1,<=*c*2) (where *c*1 and *c*2 are some lowercase English letters), which can arbitrary number of times transform a single letter *c*1 to *c*2 and vise-versa on both Tolya's t-shirt and Valya's pullover.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Limak is a little polar bear. Polar bears hate long strings and thus they like to compress them. You should also know that Limak is so young that he knows only first six letters of the English alphabet: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' and 'f'.\n\nYou are given a set of *q* possible operations. Limak can perform them in any order, any operation may be applied any number of times. The *i*-th operation is described by a string *a**i* of length two and a string *b**i* of length one. No two of *q* possible operations have the same string *a**i*.\n\nWhen Limak has a string *s* he can perform the *i*-th operation on *s* if the first two letters of *s* match a two-letter string *a**i*. Performing the *i*-th operation removes first two letters of *s* and inserts there a string *b**i*. See the notes section for further clarification.\n\nYou may note that performing an operation decreases the length of a string *s* exactly by 1. Also, for some sets of operations there may be a string that cannot be compressed any further, because the first two letters don't match any *a**i*.\n\nLimak wants to start with a string of length *n* and perform *n*<=-<=1 operations to finally get a one-letter string \"a\". In how many ways can he choose the starting string to be able to get \"a\"? Remember that Limak can use only letters he knows.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *q* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=6, 1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=36)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the initial string and the number of available operations.\n\nThe next *q* lines describe the possible operations.

It's guaranteed that *a**i*<=\u2260<=*a**j* for *i*<=\u2260<=*j* and that all *a**i* and *b**i* consist of only first six lowercase English letters.. Output specification: Print the number of strings of length *n* that Limak will be able to transform to string \"a\" by applying only operations given in the input.\nNote: In the first sample, we count initial strings of length 3 from which Limak can get a required string \"a\". There are 4 such strings: \"abb\", \"cab\", \"cca\", \"eea\". The first one Limak can compress using operation 1 two times (changing \"ab\" to a single \"a\"). The first operation would change \"abb\" to \"ab\" and the second operation would change \"ab\" to \"a\".\n\nOther three strings may be compressed as follows: \n -  \"cab\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ab\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"a\" -  \"cca\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ca\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"a\" -  \"eea\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ca\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"a\" \nIn the second sample, the only correct initial string is \"eb\" because it can be immediately compressed to \"a\".Complete the following code: ```python\ndef fd(s):\r\n    if len(s) == n:\r\n        global r\r\n        r+=1\r\n```"}]}}

A page with a chatlist in his favourite network is made so that when a message is sent to some friend, his friend's chat rises to the very top of the page. The relative order of the other chats doesn't change. If there was no chat with this friend before, then a new chat is simply inserted to the top of the list.\n\nAssuming that the chat list is initially empty, given the sequence of Polycaprus' messages make a list of chats after all of his messages are processed.

Two strings *a* and *b* of equal length are called equivalent in one of the two cases: \n 1.  They are equal. 1.  If we split string *a* into two halves of the same size *a*1 and *a*2, and string *b* into two halves of the same size *b*1 and *b*2, then one of the following is correct:   *a*1 is equivalent to *b*1, and *a*2 is equivalent to *b*2 1.  *a*1 is equivalent to *b*2, and *a*2 is equivalent to *b*1 \nAs a home task, the teacher gave two strings to his students and asked to determine if they are equivalent.\n\nGerald has already completed this home task. Now it's your turn!\nInput specification: The first two lines of the input contain two strings given by the teacher. Each of them has the length from 1 to 200<=000 and consists of lowercase English letters. The strings have the same length.. Output specification: Print \"YES\" (without the quotes), if these two strings are equivalent, and \"NO\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\nNote: In the first sample you should split the first string into strings \"aa\" and \"ba\", the second one \u2014 into strings \"ab\" and \"aa\". \"aa\" is equivalent to \"aa\"; \"ab\" is equivalent to \"ba\" as \"ab\" = \"a\" + \"b\", \"ba\" = \"b\" + \"a\".\n\nIn the second sample the first string can be splitted into strings \"aa\" and \"bb\", that are equivalent only to themselves.

Complete the given code for the following problem: In a building where Polycarp lives there are equal number of flats on each floor. Unfortunately, Polycarp don't remember how many flats are on each floor, but he remembers that the flats are numbered from 1 from lower to upper floors. That is, the first several flats are on the first floor, the next several flats are on the second and so on. Polycarp don't remember the total number of flats in the building, so you can consider the building to be infinitely high (i.e. there are infinitely many floors). Note that the floors are numbered from 1.\n\nPolycarp remembers on which floors several flats are located. It is guaranteed that this information is not self-contradictory. It means that there exists a building with equal number of flats on each floor so that the flats from Polycarp's memory have the floors Polycarp remembers.\n\nGiven this information, is it possible to restore the exact floor for flat *n*?\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100, 0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is the number of the flat you need to restore floor for, and *m* is the number of flats in Polycarp's memory.\n\n*m* lines follow, describing the Polycarp's memory: each of these lines contains a pair of integers *k**i*,<=*f**i* (1<=\u2264<=*k**i*<=\u2264<=100, 1<=\u2264<=*f**i*<=\u2264<=100), which means that the flat *k**i* is on the *f**i*-th floor.

Progressions in Uzhlyandia are unusual: both *b*1 and *q* can equal 0. Also, Dvastan gave Masha *m* \"bad\" integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**m*, and an integer *l*.\n\nMasha writes all progression terms one by one onto the board (including repetitive) while condition |*b**i*|<=\u2264<=*l* is satisfied (|*x*| means absolute value of *x*). There is an exception: if a term equals one of the \"bad\" integers, Masha skips it (doesn't write onto the board) and moves forward to the next term.\n\nBut the lesson is going to end soon, so Masha has to calculate how many integers will be written on the board. In order not to get into depression, Masha asked you for help: help her calculate how many numbers she will write, or print \"inf\" in case she needs to write infinitely many integers.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains four integers *b*1, *q*, *l*, *m* (-109<=\u2264<=*b*1,<=*q*<=\u2264<=109, 1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=109, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the initial term and the common ratio of progression, absolute value of maximal number that can be written on the board and the number of \"bad\" integers, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains *m* distinct integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**m* (-109<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 numbers that will never be written on the board..

Progression term 6 will be skipped because it is a \"bad\" integer. Terms bigger than 24 won't be written because they exceed *l* by absolute value.\n\nIn the second case, Masha won't write any number because all terms are equal 123 and this is a \"bad\" integer.\n\nIn the third case, Masha will write infinitely integers 123.Complete the following code: ```python\n#!/usr/bin/env pypy3\r\ninf = 'inf'\r\neps = 10**-6\r\nimport math\r\n\r\nstart, q, lim, _ = (int(x) for x in input().split())\r\nexcs = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\r\n\r\n```"}]}}

For every integer *i* where 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1 the condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* holds. Next, he made *n*<=-<=1 portals, numbered by integers from 1 to *n*<=-<=1. The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) portal connects cell *i* and cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*), and one can travel from cell *i* to cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) using the *i*-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) to cell *i* using the *i*-th portal. It is easy to see that because of condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* one can't leave the Line World using portals.\n\nCurrently, I am standing at cell 1, and I want to go to cell *t*. However, I don't know whether it is possible to go there. Please determine whether I can go to cell *t* by only using the construted transportation system.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3<=\u00d7<=104) and *t* (2<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of cells, and the index of the cell which I want to go to.\n\nThe second line contains *n*<=-<=1 space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1 (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i*). It is guaranteed, that using the given transportation system, one cannot leave the Line World.. Output specification: If I can go to cell *t* using the transportation system, print \"YES\". Otherwise, print \"NO\".\nNote: In the first sample, the visited cells are: 1,\u20092,\u20094; so we can successfully visit the cell 4.\n\nIn the second sample, the possible cells to visit are: 1,\u20092,\u20094,\u20096,\u20097,\u20098; so we can't visit the cell 5, which we want to visit.Complete the following code: ```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict,deque\r\nn,t=list(map(int,input().split()))\r\narray=list(map(int,input().split()))\r\ngraph=defaultdict(list)\r\n\r\nfor i in range(1,n):\r\n    graph[i].append(i+array[i-1])\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: Winnie-the-Pooh likes honey very much! That is why he decided to visit his friends. Winnie has got three best friends: Rabbit, Owl and Eeyore, each of them lives in his own house. There are winding paths between each pair of houses. The length of a path between Rabbit's and Owl's houses is *a* meters, between Rabbit's and Eeyore's house is *b* meters, between Owl's and Eeyore's house is *c* meters.\n\nFor enjoying his life and singing merry songs Winnie-the-Pooh should have a meal *n* times a day. Now he is in the Rabbit's house and has a meal for the first time. Each time when in the friend's house where Winnie is now the supply of honey is about to end, Winnie leaves that house. If Winnie has not had a meal the required amount of times, he comes out from the house and goes to someone else of his two friends. For this he chooses one of two adjacent paths, arrives to the house on the other end and visits his friend. You may assume that when Winnie is eating in one of his friend's house, the supply of honey in other friend's houses recover (most probably, they go to the supply store).\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh does not like physical activity. He wants to have a meal *n* times, traveling minimum possible distance. Help him to find this distance.\nInput specification: First line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 number of visits.\n\nSecond line contains an integer *a* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 distance between Rabbit's and Owl's houses.\n\nThird line contains an integer *b* (1<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 distance between Rabbit's and Eeyore's houses.\n\nFourth line contains an integer *c* (1<=\u2264<=*c*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 distance between Owl's and Eeyore's houses.. Output specification: Output one number\u00a0\u2014 minimum distance in meters Winnie must go through to have a meal *n* times.\nNote: In the first test case the optimal path for Winnie is the following: first have a meal in Rabbit's house, then in Owl's house, then in Eeyore's house. Thus he will pass the distance 2\u2009+\u20091\u2009=\u20093.\n\nIn the second test case Winnie has a meal in Rabbit's house and that is for him. So he doesn't have to walk anywhere at all.Complete the following code: ```python\nfrom sys import stdin, stdout\r\nfrom functools import reduce\r\n\r\n```"}]}}

For example, instead of the phrase \"how are you\" he can type \"hhoow aaaare yyoouu\". \n\nPolycarp decided to automate the process of correcting such errors. He decided to write a plug-in to the text editor that will remove pairs of identical consecutive letters (if there are any in the text). Of course, this is not exactly what Polycarp needs, but he's got to start from something! \n\nHelp Polycarp and write the main plug-in module. Your program should remove from a string all pairs of identical letters, which are consecutive. If after the removal there appear new pairs, the program should remove them as well. Technically, its work should be equivalent to the following: while the string contains a pair of consecutive identical letters, the pair should be deleted.

That is a problem for the organizers because they want a winner. \n\nWhile watching previous races the organizers have noticed that Willman can perform only steps of length equal to *w* meters, and Bolt can perform only steps of length equal to *b* meters. Organizers decided to slightly change the rules of the race. Now, at the end of the racetrack there will be an abyss, and the winner will be declared the athlete, who manages to run farther from the starting point of the the racetrack (which is not the subject to change by any of the athletes). \n\nNote that none of the athletes can run infinitely far, as they both will at some moment of time face the point, such that only one step further will cause them to fall in the abyss. In other words, the athlete will not fall into the abyss if the total length of all his steps will be less or equal to the chosen distance *L*.\n\nSince the organizers are very fair, the are going to set the length of the racetrack as an integer chosen randomly and uniformly in range from 1 to *t* (both are included).

The graveyard where Greg is busy excavating and his crypt can be represented by two points on the cone's surface. All you've got to do is find the distance between points on the cone's surface. \n\nThe task is complicated by the fact that the mountain's base on the ground level and even everything below the mountain has been dug through by gnome (one may wonder whether they've been looking for the same stuff as Greg...). So, one can consider the shortest way to pass not only along the side surface, but also along the cone's base (and in a specific case both points can lie on the cone's base \u2014 see the first sample test)\n\nGreg will be satisfied with the problem solution represented as the length of the shortest path between two points \u2014 he can find his way pretty well on his own. He gave you two hours to solve the problem and the time is ticking!\nInput specification: The first input line contains space-separated integers *r* and *h* (1<=\u2264<=*r*,<=*h*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the base radius and the cone height correspondingly. The second and third lines contain coordinates of two points on the cone surface, groups of three space-separated real numbers. The coordinates of the points are given in the systems of coordinates where the origin of coordinates is located in the centre of the cone's base and its rotation axis matches the *OZ* axis. In this coordinate system the vertex of the cone is located at the point (0,<=0,<=*h*), the base of the cone is a circle whose center is at the point (0,<=0,<=0), lying on the *XOY* plane, and all points on the cone surface have a non-negative coordinate *z*. It is guaranteed that the distances from the points to the cone surface do not exceed 10<=-<=12. All real numbers in the input have no more than 16 digits after decimal point.. Output specification: Print the length of the shortest path between the points given in the input, with absolute or relative error not exceeding 10<=-<=6.\nNote: noneComplete the following code: ```python\nimport math\r\n\r\n# Input\r\nr, h = map(float, input().split())\r\nx1, y1, z1 = map(float, input().split())\r\nx2, y2, z2 = map(float, input().split())\r\n\r\n# Distance function between two 3D points\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: A famous sculptor Cicasso goes to a world tour!\n\nWell, it is not actually a world-wide. But not everyone should have the opportunity to see works of sculptor, shouldn't he? Otherwise there will be no any exclusivity. So Cicasso will entirely hold the world tour in his native country \u2014 Berland.\n\nCicasso is very devoted to his work and he wants to be distracted as little as possible. Therefore he will visit only four cities. These cities will be different, so no one could think that he has \"favourites\". Of course, to save money, he will chose the shortest paths between these cities. But as you have probably guessed, Cicasso is a weird person. Although he doesn't like to organize exhibitions, he likes to travel around the country and enjoy its scenery. So he wants the total distance which he will travel to be as large as possible. However, the sculptor is bad in planning, so he asks you for help. \n\nThere are *n* cities and *m* one-way roads in Berland. You have to choose four different cities, which Cicasso will visit and also determine the order in which he will visit them. So that the total distance he will travel, if he visits cities in your order, starting from the first city in your list, and ending in the last, choosing each time the shortest route between a pair of cities \u2014 will be the largest. \n\nNote that intermediate routes may pass through the cities, which are assigned to the tour, as well as pass twice through the same city. For example, the tour can look like that: . Four cities in the order of visiting marked as overlines: [1,<=5,<=2,<=4].\n\nNote that Berland is a high-tech country. So using nanotechnologies all roads were altered so that they have the same length. For the same reason moving using regular cars is not very popular in the country, and it can happen that there are such pairs of cities, one of which generally can not be reached by car from the other one. However, Cicasso is very conservative and cannot travel without the car. Choose cities so that the sculptor can make the tour using only the automobile. It is guaranteed that it is always possible to do.\nInput specification: In the first line there is a pair of integers *n* and *m* (4<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3000,<=3<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=5000) \u2014 a number of cities and one-way roads in Berland.\n\nEach of the next *m* lines contains a pair of integers *u**i*,<=*v**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 a one-way road from the city *u**i* to the city *v**i*. Note that *u**i* and *v**i* are not required to be distinct. Moreover, it can be several one-way roads between the same pair of cities.. Output specification: Print four integers \u2014 numbers of cities which Cicasso will visit according to optimal choice of the route. Numbers of cities should be printed in the order that Cicasso will visit them. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\nNote: Let *d*(*x*,\u2009*y*) be the shortest distance between cities *x* and *y*. Then in the example *d*(2,\u20091)\u2009=\u20093,\u2009*d*(1,\u20098)\u2009=\u20097,\u2009*d*(8,\u20097)\u2009=\u20093.

People live in cells. However, it was hard to move between distinct cells, because of the difficulty of escaping the cell. People wanted to meet people who live in other cells.\n\nSo, user tncks0121 has made a transportation system to move between these cells, to celebrate the New Year. First, he thought of *n*<=-<=1 positive integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1. For every integer *i* where 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1 the condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* holds. Next, he made *n*<=-<=1 portals, numbered by integers from 1 to *n*<=-<=1. The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) portal connects cell *i* and cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*), and one can travel from cell *i* to cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) using the *i*-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) to cell *i* using the *i*-th portal. It is easy to see that because of condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* one can't leave the Line World using portals.\n\nCurrently, I am standing at cell 1, and I want to go to cell *t*. However, I don't know whether it is possible to go there. Please determine whether I can go to cell *t* by only using the construted transportation system.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3<=\u00d7<=104) and *t* (2<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of cells, and the index of the cell which I want to go to.\n\nThe second line contains *n*<=-<=1 space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1 (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i*). It is guaranteed, that using the given transportation system, one cannot leave the Line World.. Output specification: If I can go to cell *t* using the transportation system, print \"YES\". Otherwise, print \"NO\".\nNote: In the first sample, the visited cells are: 1,\u20092,\u20094; so we can successfully visit the cell 4.\n\nIn the second sample, the possible cells to visit are: 1,\u20092,\u20094,\u20096,\u20097,\u20098; so we can't visit the cell 5, which we want to visit.Complete the following code: ```python\n    \r\nn,t = map(int,input().split())\r\nb = [0] * n\r\na = list(map(int,input().split()))\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network. \n\nBut yesterday, he came to see \"her\" in the real world and found out \"she\" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.\n\nThis is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.\nInput specification: The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters \u2014 the user name.

The product of numbers from the first set gives the fraction numerator, the product of numbers from the second set gives the fraction denominator. However, it turned out that the programs that work with fractions in this representations aren't complete, they lack supporting the operation of reducing fractions. Implement this operation and the Empire won't forget you.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two space-separated integers *n*, *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) that show how many numbers the first set (the numerator) and the second set (the denominator) contain, correspondingly.\n\nThe second line contains *n* space-separated integers: *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=107) \u2014 the numbers that are multiplied to produce the numerator.\n\nThe third line contains *m* space-separated integers: *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=107) \u2014 the numbers that are multiplied to produce the denominator..

When playing two on two, one player of each team controls the goalkeeper and the full-backs (plays defence), the other player controls the half-backs and forwards (plays attack).\n\nTwo teams of company Q decided to battle each other. Let's enumerate players from both teams by integers from 1 to 4. The first and second player play in the first team, the third and the fourth one play in the second team. For each of the four players we know their game skills in defence and attack. The defence skill of the *i*-th player is *a**i*, the attack skill is *b**i*.\n\nBefore the game, the teams determine how they will play. First the players of the first team decide who will play in the attack, and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do the same, based on the choice of their opponents.\n\nWe will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.\n\nThe teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Developers often face with regular expression patterns. A pattern is usually defined as a string consisting of characters and metacharacters that sets the rules for your search. These patterns are most often used to check whether a particular string meets the certain rules.\n\nIn this task, a pattern will be a string consisting of small English letters and question marks ('?'). The question mark in the pattern is a metacharacter that denotes an arbitrary small letter of the English alphabet. We will assume that a string matches the pattern if we can transform the string into the pattern by replacing the question marks by the appropriate characters. For example, string aba matches patterns: ???, ??a, a?a, aba.\n\nProgrammers that work for the R1 company love puzzling each other (and themselves) with riddles. One of them is as follows: you are given *n* patterns of the same length, you need to find a pattern that contains as few question marks as possible, and intersects with each of the given patterns. Two patterns intersect if there is a string that matches both the first and the second pattern. Can you solve this riddle?\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of patterns. Next *n* lines contain the patterns.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the patterns can only consist of small English letters and symbols '?'. All patterns are non-empty and have the same length.

Pattern ??? also intersects with each of the given patterns, but it contains more question signs, hence it is not an optimal answer.

You can perform multiple operations on the arrays. In a single operation, you are allowed to decrease or increase any element of any of the arrays by 1. Note that you are allowed to apply the operation on any index of the array multiple times.\n\nYou need to find minimum number of operations required to satisfy Devu's condition so that the brothers can play peacefully without fighting.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n*, *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105).

Complete the given code for the following problem: Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective. You are able to cope with it not worse, aren't you?\nInput specification: The first and single line contains two integers *A* and *B* (1<=\u2264<=*A*,<=*B*<=\u2264<=109,<=*min*(*A*,<=*B*)<=\u2264<=12)..

For each team we are shown two numbers: the number of problems and the total penalty time. However, for no team we are shown its final place.\n\nYou know the rules of comparing the results of two given teams very well. Let's say that team *a* solved *p**a* problems with total penalty time *t**a* and team *b* solved *p**b* problems with total penalty time *t**b*. Team *a* gets a higher place than team *b* in the end, if it either solved more problems on the contest, or solved the same number of problems but in less total time.

In other words, difficulty equals the maximum distance between two holds that are adjacent in height.\n\nToday Mike decided to cover the track with holds hanging on heights *a*1, ..., *a**n*. To make the problem harder, Mike decided to remove one hold, that is, remove one element of the sequence (for example, if we take the sequence (1,<=2,<=3,<=4,<=5) and remove the third element from it, we obtain the sequence (1,<=2,<=4,<=5)). However, as Mike is awful at climbing, he wants the final difficulty (i.e. the maximum difference of heights between adjacent holds after removing the hold) to be as small as possible among all possible options of removing a hold.

Output specification: Print a single number \u2014 the minimum difficulty of the track after removing a single hold.\nNote: In the first sample you can remove only the second hold, then the sequence looks like (1,\u20096), the maximum difference of the neighboring elements equals 5.\n\nIn the second test after removing every hold the difficulty equals 2.\n\nIn the third test you can obtain sequences (1,\u20093,\u20097,\u20098), (1,\u20092,\u20097,\u20098), (1,\u20092,\u20093,\u20098), for which the difficulty is 4, 5 and 5, respectively.

The trainer swaps the animals in pairs not to create a mess. He orders two animals to step out of the circle and swap places. As hamsters feel highly uncomfortable when tigers are nearby as well as tigers get nervous when there's so much potential prey around (consisting not only of hamsters but also of yummier spectators), the trainer wants to spend as little time as possible moving the animals, i.e. he wants to achieve it with the minimal number of swaps. Your task is to help him.\nInput specification: The first line contains number *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000) which indicates the total number of animals in the arena.

All numbers *a**i* accidentally turned out to be different.\n\nNow the children wonder, how to divide the orange so as to meet these conditions:\n -  each child gets exactly *n* orange segments; -  the *i*-th child gets the segment with number *a**i* for sure; -  no segment goes to two children simultaneously. \nHelp the children, divide the orange and fulfill the requirements, described above.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=30). The second line contains *k* space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**k* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*\u00b7*k*), where *a**i* is the number of the orange segment that the *i*-th child would like to get.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all numbers *a**i* are distinct.. Output specification: Print exactly *n*\u00b7*k* distinct integers. The first *n* integers represent the indexes of the segments the first child will get, the second *n* integers represent the indexes of the segments the second child will get, and so on. Separate the printed numbers with whitespaces.\n\nYou can print a child's segment indexes in any order. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists. If there are multiple correct answers, print any of them.\nNote: noneComplete the following code: ```python\n#include <iostream>\r\n#include <algorithm>\r\n#include <vector>\r\n#include <cstring>\r\n#include <map>\r\n#include <set>\r\n#include <unordered_map>\r\n#include <unordered_set>\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: Polycarp is practicing his problem solving skill. He has a list of $n$ problems with difficulties $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $k$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $n$ problems in exactly $k$ days.\n\nThus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $k$ days he will solve all the $n$ problems.\n\nThe profit of the $j$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $j$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $l$ to $r$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $k$ days of his practice.\n\nYou want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $n$ problems between $k$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.\n\nFor example, if $n = 8, k = 3$ and $a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$.

Output specification: In the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.\n\nIn the second line print exactly $k$ positive integers $t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$ ($t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$ must equal $n$), where $t_j$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $j$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.\n\nIf there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\nNote: The first example is described in the problem statement.\n\nIn the second example there is only one possible distribution.\n\nIn the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.

It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nNote: In the first sample Vasya's approach will make one comparison (it starts with the 1-st element and immediately finds the required number), and Petya's approach makes two comparisons (first he compares with the 2-nd array element, doesn't find the search item and compares with the 1-st element).\n\nIn the second sample, on the contrary, Vasya's approach will need two comparisons (first with 1-st element, and then with the 2-nd), and Petya's approach will find the required value in one comparison (the first comparison with the 2-nd element).Complete the following code: ```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\r\nn = int(input())\r\narr = list(map(int,input().split()))\r\nm = int(input())\r\n```"}]}}

'?' denotes an unrecognized command.\n\nLengths of two strings are equal and do not exceed 10.. Output specification: Output a single real number corresponding to the probability. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10<=-<=9.\nNote: For the first sample, both *s*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub> and *s*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub> will lead Dreamoon to finish at the same position \u2009+\u20091. \n\nFor the second sample, *s*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub> will lead Dreamoon to finish at position 0, while there are four possibilites for *s*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>: {\"+-++\", \"+-+-\", \"+--+\", \"+---\"} with ending position {+2, 0, 0, -2} respectively. So there are 2 correct cases out of 4, so the probability of finishing at the correct position is 0.5. \n\nFor the third sample, *s*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub> could only lead us to finish at positions {+1, -1, -3}, so the probability to finish at the correct position \u2009+\u20093 is 0.Complete the following code: ```python\ns1 = input()\r\ns2 = input()\r\n\r\npos = 0\r\n\r\n\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: Valeric and Valerko missed the last Euro football game, so they decided to watch the game's key moments on the Net. They want to start watching as soon as possible but the connection speed is too low. If they turn on the video right now, it will \"hang up\" as the size of data to watch per second will be more than the size of downloaded data per second.\n\nThe guys want to watch the whole video without any pauses, so they have to wait some integer number of seconds for a part of the video to download. After this number of seconds passes, they can start watching. Waiting for the whole video to download isn't necessary as the video can download after the guys started to watch.\n\nLet's suppose that video's length is *c* seconds and Valeric and Valerko wait *t* seconds before the watching. Then for any moment of time *t*0, *t*<=\u2264<=*t*0<=\u2264<=*c*<=+<=*t*, the following condition must fulfill: the size of data received in *t*0 seconds is not less than the size of data needed to watch *t*0<=-<=*t* seconds of the video.\n\nOf course, the guys want to wait as little as possible, so your task is to find the minimum integer number of seconds to wait before turning the video on.

The first number (*a*) denotes the size of data needed to watch one second of the video. The second number (*b*) denotes the size of data Valeric and Valerko can download from the Net per second. The third number (*c*) denotes the video's length in seconds.. Output specification: Print a single number \u2014 the minimum integer number of seconds that Valeric and Valerko must wait to watch football without pauses.\nNote: In the first sample video's length is 1 second and it is necessary 4 units of data for watching 1 second of video, so guys should download 4 \u00b7 1 = 4 units of data to watch the whole video. The most optimal way is to wait 3 seconds till 3 units of data will be downloaded and then start watching. While guys will be watching video 1 second, one unit of data will be downloaded and Valerik and Valerko will have 4 units of data by the end of watching. Also every moment till the end of video guys will have more data then necessary for watching.\n\nIn the second sample guys need 2 \u00b7 10 = 20 units of data, so they have to wait 5 seconds and after that they will have 20 units before the second second ends. However, if guys wait 4 seconds, they will be able to watch first second of video without pauses, but they will download 18 units of data by the end of second second and it is less then necessary.Complete the following code: ```python\nimport math\r\nI = lambda: int(input())\r\ntup = lambda: map(int, input().split())\r\nlst = lambda: list(map(int, input().split()))\r\n\r\n    \r\n```"}]}}

People live in cells. However, it was hard to move between distinct cells, because of the difficulty of escaping the cell. People wanted to meet people who live in other cells.\n\nSo, user tncks0121 has made a transportation system to move between these cells, to celebrate the New Year. First, he thought of *n*<=-<=1 positive integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1. For every integer *i* where 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1 the condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* holds. Next, he made *n*<=-<=1 portals, numbered by integers from 1 to *n*<=-<=1. The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) portal connects cell *i* and cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*), and one can travel from cell *i* to cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) using the *i*-th portal.

Of course, a member can't be a friend with themselves.\n\nLet A-B denote that members A and B are friends. Limak thinks that a network is reasonable if and only if the following condition is satisfied: For every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z then also X-Z.\n\nFor example: if Alan and Bob are friends, and Bob and Ciri are friends, then Alan and Ciri should be friends as well.\n\nCan you help Limak and check if the network is reasonable? Print \"YES\" or \"NO\" accordingly, without the quotes.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contain two integers *n* and *m* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=150<=000, )\u00a0\u2014 the number of members and the number of pairs of members that are friends.\n\nThe *i*-th of the next *m* lines contains two distinct integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*a**i*<=\u2260<=*b**i*). Members *a**i* and *b**i* are friends with each other. No pair of members will appear more than once in the input.. Output specification: If the given network is reasonable, print \"YES\" in a single line (without the quotes). Otherwise, print \"NO\" in a single line (without the quotes).\nNote: The drawings below show the situation in the first sample (on the left) and in the second sample (on the right). Each edge represents two members that are friends. The answer is \"NO\" in the second sample because members (2,\u20093) are friends and members (3,\u20094) are friends, while members (2,\u20094) are not.Complete the following code: ```python\ndef solve(n, f):\n   \n    fd = {}\n    for a, b in f:\n        fd.setdefault(a, []).append(b)\n```"}]}}

The height of the *i*-th board is *h**i* centimeters.\n\nVasya has a 1 centimeter wide brush and the paint of two colors, red and green. Of course, the amount of the paint is limited. Vasya counted the area he can paint each of the colors. It turned out that he can not paint over *a* square centimeters of the fence red, and he can not paint over *b* square centimeters green. Each board of the fence should be painted exactly one of the two colors. Perhaps Vasya won't need one of the colors.\n\nIn addition, Vasya wants his fence to look smart. To do this, he should paint the fence so as to minimize the value that Vasya called the fence unattractiveness value. Vasya believes that two consecutive fence boards, painted different colors, look unattractive.

For example, after letter 'c' can't go letters 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd', but can go letters 'e', 'f', ..., 'z'.\n\nFor the rocket to fly as far as possible, its weight should be minimal. The weight of the rocket is equal to the sum of the weights of its stages. The weight of the stage is the number of its letter in the alphabet.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Polycarp is currently developing a project in Vaja language and using a popular dependency management system called Vamen. From Vamen's point of view both Vaja project and libraries are treated projects for simplicity.\n\nA project in Vaja has its own uniqie non-empty name consisting of lowercase latin letters with length not exceeding 10 and version \u2014 positive integer from 1 to 106. Each project (keep in mind that it is determined by both its name and version) might depend on other projects. For sure, there are no cyclic dependencies.\n\nYou're given a list of project descriptions. The first of the given projects is the one being developed by Polycarp at this moment. Help Polycarp determine all projects that his project depends on (directly or via a certain chain). \n\nIt's possible that Polycarp's project depends on two different versions of some project. In this case collision resolving is applied, i.e. for each such project the system chooses the version that minimizes the distance from it to Polycarp's project. If there are several options, the newer (with the maximum version) is preferred. This version is considered actual; other versions and their dependencies are ignored.\n\nMore formal, choose such a set of projects of minimum possible size that the following conditions hold: \n -  Polycarp's project is chosen; -  Polycarp's project depends (directly or indirectly) on all other projects in the set; -  no two projects share the name; -  for each project *x* that some other project in the set depends on we have either *x* or some *y* with other version and shorter chain to Polycarp's project chosen. In case of ties the newer one is chosen. \nOutput all Polycarp's project's dependencies (Polycarp's project itself should't be printed) in lexicographical order.\nInput specification: The first line contains an only integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1<=000) \u2014 the number of projects in Vaja.\n\nThe following lines contain the project descriptions. Each project is described by a line consisting of its name and version separated by space. The next line gives the number of direct dependencies (from 0 to *n*<=-<=1) and the dependencies themselves (one in a line) in arbitrary order. Each dependency is specified by its name and version. The projects are also given in arbitrary order, but the first of them is always Polycarp's. Project descriptions are separated by one empty line.

Complete the given code for the following problem: One way to create a task is to learn from math. You can generate some random math statement or modify some theorems to get something new and build a new task from that.\n\nFor example, there is a statement called the \"Goldbach's conjecture\". It says: \"each even number no less than four can be expressed as the sum of two primes\". Let's modify it. How about a statement like that: \"each integer no less than 12 can be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers.\" Not like the Goldbach's conjecture, I can prove this theorem.\n\nYou are given an integer *n* no less than 12, express it as a sum of two composite numbers.\nInput specification: The only line contains an integer *n* (12<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=106)..

Complete the given code for the following problem: By 2312 there were *n* Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*).. Output specification: Print *m* lines \u2014 the results of executing requests in the above given format. The requests should be processed in the order, in which they are given in the input.

Complete the given code for the following problem: New Year is coming in Line World! In this world, there are *n* cells numbered by integers from 1 to *n*, as a 1<=\u00d7<=*n* board. People live in cells. However, it was hard to move between distinct cells, because of the difficulty of escaping the cell. People wanted to meet people who live in other cells.\n\nSo, user tncks0121 has made a transportation system to move between these cells, to celebrate the New Year. First, he thought of *n*<=-<=1 positive integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1. For every integer *i* where 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1 the condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* holds. Next, he made *n*<=-<=1 portals, numbered by integers from 1 to *n*<=-<=1. The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) portal connects cell *i* and cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*), and one can travel from cell *i* to cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) using the *i*-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) to cell *i* using the *i*-th portal. It is easy to see that because of condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* one can't leave the Line World using portals.\n\nCurrently, I am standing at cell 1, and I want to go to cell *t*. However, I don't know whether it is possible to go there. Please determine whether I can go to cell *t* by only using the construted transportation system.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3<=\u00d7<=104) and *t* (2<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of cells, and the index of the cell which I want to go to.\n\nThe second line contains *n*<=-<=1 space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1 (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i*). It is guaranteed, that using the given transportation system, one cannot leave the Line World.. Output specification: If I can go to cell *t* using the transportation system, print \"YES\". Otherwise, print \"NO\".\nNote: In the first sample, the visited cells are: 1,\u20092,\u20094; so we can successfully visit the cell 4.\n\nIn the second sample, the possible cells to visit are: 1,\u20092,\u20094,\u20096,\u20097,\u20098; so we can't visit the cell 5, which we want to visit.Complete the following code: ```python\ndef dfs(i, adj, vis, t):\r\n    if i == t:\r\n        return True\r\n    vis[i] = 1\r\n    for j in adj[i]:\r\n        if vis[j] == 0:\r\n            return dfs(j, adj, vis, t)\r\n```"}]}}

Petya wanted to create a maximally simple language that would be enough to chat with friends, that's why all the language's grammar can be described with the following set of rules:\n-  There are three parts of speech: the adjective, the noun, the verb. Each word in his language is an adjective, noun or verb. -  There are two genders: masculine and feminine. Each word in his language has gender either masculine or feminine. -  Masculine adjectives end with -lios, and feminine adjectives end with -liala. -  Masculine nouns end with -etr, and feminime nouns end with -etra. -  Masculine verbs end with -initis, and feminime verbs end with -inites. -  Thus, each word in the Petya's language has one of the six endings, given above. There are no other endings in Petya's language. -  It is accepted that the whole word consists of an ending. That is, words \"lios\", \"liala\", \"etr\" and so on belong to the Petya's language. -  There aren't any punctuation marks, grammatical tenses, singular/plural forms or other language complications. -  A sentence is either exactly one valid language word or exactly one statement. \nStatement is any sequence of the Petya's language, that satisfy both conditions:\n-  Words in statement follow in the following order (from the left to the right): zero or more adjectives followed by exactly one noun followed by zero or more verbs. -  All words in the statement should have the same gender.\nAfter Petya's friend Vasya wrote instant messenger (an instant messaging program) that supported the Petya's language, Petya wanted to add spelling and grammar checking to the program. As Vasya was in the country and Petya didn't feel like waiting, he asked you to help him with this problem.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Shapur was an extremely gifted student. He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.\n\nOne day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.\nInput specification: There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number. It is guaranteed that the numbers are made from 0 and 1 only and that their length is same. The numbers may start with 0. The length of each number doesn't exceed 100.. Output specification: Write one line \u2014 the corresponding answer. Do not omit the leading 0s.\nNote: noneComplete the following code: ```python\na = input()\r\nb = input()\r\ndef f(a,b):\r\n    listi = []\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: The R1 company has recently bought a high rise building in the centre of Moscow for its main office. It's time to decorate the new office, and the first thing to do is to write the company's slogan above the main entrance to the building.\n\nThe slogan of the company consists of *n* characters, so the decorators hung a large banner, *n* meters wide and 1 meter high, divided into *n* equal squares. The first character of the slogan must be in the first square (the leftmost) of the poster, the second character must be in the second square, and so on.\n\nOf course, the R1 programmers want to write the slogan on the poster themselves. To do this, they have a large (and a very heavy) ladder which was put exactly opposite the *k*-th square of the poster. To draw the *i*-th character of the slogan on the poster, you need to climb the ladder, standing in front of the *i*-th square of the poster. This action (along with climbing up and down the ladder) takes one hour for a painter. The painter is not allowed to draw characters in the adjacent squares when the ladder is in front of the *i*-th square because the uncomfortable position of the ladder may make the characters untidy. Besides, the programmers can move the ladder. In one hour, they can move the ladder either a meter to the right or a meter to the left.\n\nDrawing characters and moving the ladder is very tiring, so the programmers want to finish the job in as little time as possible.

Output specification: In *t* lines, print the actions the programmers need to make.

If there are multiple optimal painting plans, you can print any of them.\nNote: Note that the ladder cannot be shifted by less than one meter. The ladder can only stand in front of some square of the poster. For example, you cannot shift a ladder by half a meter and position it between two squares.

Complete the given code for the following problem: A few years ago, Hitagi encountered a giant crab, who stole the whole of her body weight. Ever since, she tried to avoid contact with others, for fear that this secret might be noticed.\n\nTo get rid of the oddity and recover her weight, a special integer sequence is needed. Hitagi's sequence has been broken for a long time, but now Kaiki provides an opportunity.\n\nHitagi's sequence *a* has a length of *n*. Lost elements in it are denoted by zeros. Kaiki provides another sequence *b*, whose length *k* equals the number of lost elements in *a* (i.e. the number of zeros). Hitagi is to replace each zero in *a* with an element from *b* so that each element in *b* should be used exactly once. Hitagi knows, however, that, apart from 0, no integer occurs in *a* and *b* more than once in total.\n\nIf the resulting sequence is not an increasing sequence, then it has the power to recover Hitagi from the oddity. You are to determine whether this is possible, or Kaiki's sequence is just another fake. In other words, you should detect whether it is possible to replace each zero in *a* with an integer from *b* so that each integer from *b* is used exactly once, and the resulting sequence is not increasing.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains two space-separated positive integers *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the lengths of sequence *a* and *b* respectively.\n\nThe second line contains *n* space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=200) \u2014 Hitagi's broken sequence with exactly *k* zero elements.\n\nThe third line contains *k* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**k* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=200) \u2014 the elements to fill into Hitagi's sequence.\n\nInput guarantees that apart from 0, no integer occurs in *a* and *b* more than once in total.. Output specification: Output \"Yes\" if it's possible to replace zeros in *a* with elements in *b* and make the resulting sequence not increasing, and \"No\" otherwise.\nNote: In the first sample: \n -  Sequence *a* is 11,\u20090,\u20090,\u200914. -  Two of the elements are lost, and the candidates in *b* are 5 and 4. -  There are two possible resulting sequences: 11,\u20095,\u20094,\u200914 and 11,\u20094,\u20095,\u200914, both of which fulfill the requirements. Thus the answer is \"Yes\". \nIn the second sample, the only possible resulting sequence is 2,\u20093,\u20095,\u20098,\u20099,\u200910, which is an increasing sequence and therefore invalid.Complete the following code: ```python\nn,k=map(int,input().split())\r\narr=list(map(int,input().split()))\r\nb=list(map(int,input().split()))\r\ndef nonincrease(arr):\r\n    res=False\r\n    n=len(arr)\r\n    c=arr.count(0)\r\n    n-=c\r\n```"}]}}

The only possible Petya's move is to go to vertex 1. After that he has to go to 3 for Vasya. Now it's Petya's turn but he has no possible move, so Petya loses.\n\nIn the third example the graph is the following:\n\nPetya can't win, but he can move along the cycle, so the players will draw a tie.Complete the following code: ```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\r\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\r\ngraph = defaultdict(list)\r\n\r\n\r\ndef bfs(start):\r\n    visited = set()\r\n    queue = deque()\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: In the year of $30XX$ participants of some world programming championship live in a single large hotel. The hotel has $n$ floors. Each floor has $m$ sections with a single corridor connecting all of them. The sections are enumerated from $1$ to $m$ along the corridor, and all sections with equal numbers on different floors are located exactly one above the other. Thus, the hotel can be represented as a rectangle of height $n$ and width $m$. We can denote sections with pairs of integers $(i, j)$, where $i$ is the floor, and $j$ is the section number on the floor.\n\nThe guests can walk along the corridor on each floor, use stairs and elevators. Each stairs or elevator occupies all sections $(1, x)$, $(2, x)$, $\\ldots$, $(n, x)$ for some $x$ between $1$ and $m$. All sections not occupied with stairs or elevators contain guest rooms. It takes one time unit to move between neighboring sections on the same floor or to move one floor up or down using stairs. It takes one time unit to move up to $v$ floors in any direction using an elevator. You can assume you don't have to wait for an elevator, and the time needed to enter or exit an elevator is negligible.\n\nYou are to process $q$ queries. Each query is a question \"what is the minimum time needed to go from a room in section $(x_1, y_1)$ to a room in section $(x_2, y_2)$?\"\nInput specification: The first line contains five integers $n, m, c_l, c_e, v$ ($2 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^8$, $0 \\leq c_l, c_e \\leq 10^5$, $1 \\leq c_l + c_e \\leq m - 1$, $1 \\leq v \\leq n - 1$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of floors and section on each floor, the number of stairs, the number of elevators and the maximum speed of an elevator, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $c_l$ integers $l_1, \\ldots, l_{c_l}$ in increasing order ($1 \\leq l_i \\leq m$), denoting the positions of the stairs. If $c_l = 0$, the second line is empty.\n\nThe third line contains $c_e$ integers $e_1, \\ldots, e_{c_e}$ in increasing order, denoting the elevators positions in the same format. It is guaranteed that all integers $l_i$ and $e_i$ are distinct.\n\nThe fourth line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \\leq q \\leq 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of queries.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe queries.

It is guaranteed that the starting and finishing sections are distinct. It is also guaranteed that these sections contain guest rooms, i.\u00a0e. $y_1$ and $y_2$ are not among $l_i$ and $e_i$.. Output specification: Print $q$ integers, one per line\u00a0\u2014 the answers for the queries.\nNote: In the first query the optimal way is to go to the elevator in the 5-th section in four time units, use it to go to the fifth floor in two time units and go to the destination in one more time unit.\n\nIn the second query it is still optimal to use the elevator, but in the third query it is better to use the stairs in the section 2.Complete the following code: ```python\n\r\nimport sys\r\ninput = sys.stdin.buffer.readline \r\n\r\ndef finder(L, x):\r\n    if x < L[0]:\r\n        return [None, L[0]]\r\n    elif x > L[-1]:\r\n```"}]}}

For each such combination calculate the minimum number of coins that can bring the buyer at least *n* marks. Among all combinations choose the maximum of the minimum number of coins. This is the number we want.\nInput specification: The single line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1017).\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64 bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.. Output specification: In a single line print an integer: the maximum number of coins the unlucky buyer could have paid with.\nNote: In the first test case, if a buyer has exactly one coin of at least 3 marks, then, to give Gerald one mark, he will have to give this coin. In this sample, the customer can not have a coin of one mark, as in this case, he will be able to give the money to Gerald without any change.\n\nIn the second test case, if the buyer had exactly three coins of 3 marks, then, to give Gerald 4 marks, he will have to give two of these coins. The buyer cannot give three coins as he wants to minimize the number of coins that he gives.Complete the following code: ```python\nimport heapq \r\nfrom collections import defaultdict \r\nimport math \r\nimport collections\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmod=10**9+7\r\n```"}]}}

Lara looked around and noticed on the floor a painted table *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* panels in size with integers written on the panels. There also was a huge number of stones lying by the wall. On the pillar near the table Lara found a guidance note which said that to get hold of the treasures one has to choose some non-zero number of the first panels in each row of the table and put stones on all those panels to push them down. After that she will receive a number of golden coins equal to the sum of numbers written on the chosen panels. Lara quickly made up her mind on how to arrange the stones and was about to start when she noticed an addition to the note in small font below. According to the addition, for the room ceiling not to crush and smash the adventurer, the chosen panels should form a comb. It was explained that the chosen panels form a comb when the sequence *c*1,<=*c*2,<=...,<=*c**n* made from the quantities of panels chosen in each table line satisfies the following property: *c*1<=&gt;<=*c*2<=&lt;<=*c*3<=&gt;<=*c*4<=&lt;<=..., i.e. the inequation mark interchanges between the neighboring elements.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.

It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nNote: In the first sample Vasya's approach will make one comparison (it starts with the 1-st element and immediately finds the required number), and Petya's approach makes two comparisons (first he compares with the 2-nd array element, doesn't find the search item and compares with the 1-st element).\n\nIn the second sample, on the contrary, Vasya's approach will need two comparisons (first with 1-st element, and then with the 2-nd), and Petya's approach will find the required value in one comparison (the first comparison with the 2-nd element).Complete the following code: ```python\nimport sys\r\ndef main() :\r\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: Petya has recently learned data structure named \"Binary heap\".\n\nThe heap he is now operating with allows the following operations: \n -  put the given number into the heap; -  get the value of the minimum element in the heap; -  extract the minimum element from the heap; \nThus, at any moment of time the heap contains several integers (possibly none), some of them might be equal.\n\nIn order to better learn this data structure Petya took an empty heap and applied some operations above to it. Also, he carefully wrote down all the operations and their results to his event log, following the format: \n -  insert *x*\u00a0\u2014 put the element with value *x* in the heap; -  getMin *x*\u00a0\u2014 the value of the minimum element contained in the heap was equal to *x*; -  removeMin\u00a0\u2014 the minimum element was extracted from the heap (only one instance, if there were many). \nAll the operations were correct, i.e. there was at least one element in the heap each time getMin or removeMin operations were applied.\n\nWhile Petya was away for a lunch, his little brother Vova came to the room, took away some of the pages from Petya's log and used them to make paper boats.\n\nNow Vova is worried, if he made Petya's sequence of operations inconsistent. For example, if one apply operations one-by-one in the order they are written in the event log, results of getMin operations might differ from the results recorded by Petya, and some of getMin or removeMin operations may be incorrect, as the heap is empty at the moment they are applied.\n\nNow Vova wants to add some new operation records to the event log in order to make the resulting sequence of operations correct. That is, the result of each getMin operation is equal to the result in the record, and the heap is non-empty when getMin ad removeMin are applied. Vova wants to complete this as fast as possible, as the Petya may get back at any moment. He asks you to add the least possible number of operation records to the current log. Note that arbitrary number of operations may be added at the beginning, between any two other operations, or at the end of the log.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains the only integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of the records left in Petya's journal.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines describe the records in the current log in the order they are applied. Format described in the statement is used. All numbers in the input are integers not exceeding 109 by their absolute value.. Output specification: The first line of the output should contain a single integer *m*\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible number of records in the modified sequence of operations.\n\nNext *m* lines should contain the corrected sequence of records following the format of the input (described in the statement), one per line and in the order they are applied. All the numbers in the output should be integers not exceeding 109 by their absolute value.\n\nNote that the input sequence of operations must be the subsequence of the output sequence.\n\nIt's guaranteed that there exists the correct answer consisting of no more than 1<=000<=000 operations.\nNote: In the first sample, after number 3 is inserted into the heap, the minimum number is 3. To make the result of the first getMin equal to 4 one should firstly remove number 3 from the heap and then add number 4 into the heap.\n\nIn the second sample case number 1 is inserted two times, so should be similarly removed twice.Complete the following code: ```python\n# https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/681/C\n\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\npp = sys.stdout.write\n\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: John gave Jack a very hard problem. He wrote a very big positive integer *A*0 on a piece of paper. The number is less than 10200000 . In each step, Jack is allowed to put '<=+<=' signs in between some of the digits (maybe none) of the current number and calculate the sum of the expression. He can perform the same procedure on that sum and so on. The resulting sums can be labeled respectively by *A*1, *A*2 etc. His task is to get to a single digit number.\n\nThe problem is that there is not much blank space on the paper. There are only three lines of space, so he can't perform more than three steps. Since he wants to fill up the paper completely, he will perform exactly three steps.\n\nJack must not add leading zeros to intermediate results, but he can put '<=+<=' signs in front of digit 0. For example, if the current number is 1000100, 10<=+<=001<=+<=00 is a valid step, resulting in number 11.\nInput specification: First line contains a positive integer *N* (1<=\u2264<=*N*<=\u2264<=200000), representing the number of digits of *A*0.\n\nSecond line contains a string of length *N* representing positive integer number *A*0. Each character is digit. There will be no leading zeros.. Output specification: Output exactly three lines, the steps Jack needs to perform to solve the problem. You can output any sequence of steps which results in a single digit number (and is logically consistent).\n\nEvery step consists of digits and '<=+<=' signs. Steps should not contain several '<=+<=' signs in a row, whitespaces, or '<=+<=' signs as the first or last character. They also need to be arithmetically consistent.\n\nSolution might not be unique. Output any of them in that case.\nNote: In the first sample, Jack can't put '\u2009+\u2009' signs anywhere, so he just writes 1 in each line and solves the problem. Here, solution is unique.\n\nIn the second sample, Jack first puts '\u2009+\u2009' between every two consecutive digits, thus getting the result 5\u2009+\u20098\u2009+\u20090\u2009+\u20096\u2009=\u200919. He does the same on the second step, getting 1\u2009+\u20099\u2009=\u200910. Once more, he gets 1\u2009+\u20090\u2009=\u20091, so after three steps, the result is 1 and his solution is correct.Complete the following code: ```python\nimport math as mt \r\nimport sys,string,bisect\r\ninput=sys.stdin.readline\r\nimport random\r\nfrom collections import deque,defaultdict\r\nL=lambda : list(map(int,input().split()))\r\nLs=lambda : list(input().split())\r\nM=lambda : map(int,input().split())\r\n```"}]}}

That is, there will not exist an employee who is the superior of his/her own immediate manager.\n\nToday the company is going to arrange a party.

While the new oven is being built, only old one can bake cakes, after the new oven is built, both ovens bake simultaneously. Arkady can't build more than one oven.\n\nDetermine if it is reasonable to build the second oven, i.e. will it decrease the minimum time needed to get *n* cakes or not.

Output specification: If it is reasonable to build the second oven, print \"YES\". Otherwise print \"NO\".\nNote: In the first example it is possible to get 8 cakes in 12 minutes using one oven. The second oven can be built in 5 minutes, so after 6 minutes the first oven bakes 4 cakes, the second oven bakes 4 more ovens after 11 minutes. Thus, it is reasonable to build the second oven. \n\nIn the second example it doesn't matter whether we build the second oven or not, thus it takes 12 minutes to bake 8 cakes in both cases. Thus, it is unreasonable to build the second oven.\n\nIn the third example the first oven bakes 11 cakes in 3 minutes, that is more than needed 10. It is unreasonable to build the second oven, because its building takes more time that baking the needed number of cakes using the only oven.Complete the following code: ```python\nimport math\r\n\r\n\r\ndef main():\r\n```"}]}}

The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.\n\nCreating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section.

If the bone happens to be at the position where there is a hole at any time, it will fall into the hole onto the ground and will not be affected by future swapping operations.\n\nDo not forget that Zane is a wizard. When he swaps the cups, he does not move them ordinarily. Instead, he teleports the cups (along with the bone, if it is inside) to the intended positions. Therefore, for example, when he swaps the cup at *x*<==<=4 and the one at *x*<==<=6, they will not be at the position *x*<==<=5 at any moment during the operation.\n\nZane\u2019s puppy, Inzane, is in trouble. Zane is away on his vacation, and Inzane cannot find his beloved bone, as it would be too exhausting to try opening all the cups. Inzane knows that the Codeforces community has successfully helped Zane, so he wants to see if it could help him solve his problem too. Help Inzane determine the final position of the bone.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=106, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cups, the number of holes on the table, and the number of swapping operations, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains *m* distinct integers *h*1,<=*h*2,<=...,<=*h**m* (1<=\u2264<=*h**i*<=\u2264<=*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the positions along the *x*-axis where there is a hole on the table.\n\nEach of the next *k* lines contains two integers *u**i* and *v**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, *u**i*<=\u2260<=*v**i*)\u00a0\u2014 the positions of the cups to be swapped.. Output specification: Print one integer\u00a0\u2014 the final position along the *x*-axis of the bone.\nNote: In the first sample, after the operations, the bone becomes at *x*\u2009=\u20092, *x*\u2009=\u20095, *x*\u2009=\u20097, and *x*\u2009=\u20091, respectively.\n\nIn the second sample, after the first operation, the bone becomes at *x*\u2009=\u20092, and falls into the hole onto the ground.Complete the following code: ```python\nimport sys\r\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Set\r\n\r\n\r\ndef solve(holes: Set[int], swaps: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:\r\n    bone_position: int = 1\r\n```"}]}}

Since Kevin wishes to minimize expenses, he is curious about the smallest size box he can use to pack his entire collection. \n\nKevin is a meticulous cowbell collector and knows that the size of his *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) cowbell is an integer *s**i*. In fact, he keeps his cowbells sorted by size, so *s**i*<=-<=1<=\u2264<=*s**i* for any *i*<=&gt;<=1. Also an expert packer, Kevin can fit one or two cowbells into a box of size *s* if and only if the sum of their sizes does not exceed *s*. Given this information, help Kevin determine the smallest *s* for which it is possible to put all of his cowbells into *k* boxes of size *s*.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7*k*<=\u2264<=100<=000), denoting the number of cowbells and the number of boxes, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains *n* space-separated integers *s*1,<=*s*2,<=...,<=*s**n* (1<=\u2264<=*s*1<=\u2264<=*s*2<=\u2264<=...<=\u2264<=*s**n*<=\u2264<=1<=000<=000), the sizes of Kevin's cowbells. It is guaranteed that the sizes *s**i* are given in non-decreasing order.. Output specification: Print a single integer, the smallest *s* for which it is possible for Kevin to put all of his cowbells into *k* boxes of size *s*.\nNote: In the first sample, Kevin must pack his two cowbells into the same box. \n\nIn the second sample, Kevin can pack together the following sets of cowbells: {2,\u20093}, {5} and {9}.\n\nIn the third sample, the optimal solution is {3,\u20095} and {7}.Complete the following code: ```python\ndef main():\n\tn, k = (map(int, input().split()))\n\ts = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n\tminSize = s[n - 1]\n\t\n```"}]}}

Many people will surely be willing to visit this splendid shrine of high culture.\n\nIn Mainframe a standard pack of 52 cards is used to play blackjack. The pack contains cards of 13 values: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jacks, queens, kings and aces. Each value also exists in one of four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. Also, each card earns some value in points assigned to it: cards with value from two to ten earn from 2 to 10 points, correspondingly. An ace can either earn 1 or 11, whatever the player wishes. The picture cards (king, queen and jack) earn 10 points. The number of points a card earns does not depend on the suit. The rules of the game are very simple. The player gets two cards, if the sum of points of those cards equals *n*, then the player wins, otherwise the player loses.\n\nThe player has already got the first card, it's the queen of spades. To evaluate chances for victory, you should determine how many ways there are to get the second card so that the sum of points exactly equals *n*.\nInput specification: The only line contains *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=25) \u2014 the required sum of points..

His current work task is to create a search engine for the website of the company. During the development process, he needs to write a subroutine for comparing strings *S* and *T* of equal length to be \"similar\". After a brief search on the Internet, he learned about the Hamming distance between two strings *S* and *T* of the same length, which is defined as the number of positions in which *S* and *T* have different characters. For example, the Hamming distance between words \"permanent\" and \"pergament\" is two, as these words differ in the fourth and sixth letters.\n\nMoreover, as he was searching for information, he also noticed that modern search engines have powerful mechanisms to correct errors in the request to improve the quality of search. Ford doesn't know much about human beings, so he assumed that the most common mistake in a request is swapping two arbitrary letters of the string (not necessarily adjacent). Now he wants to write a function that determines which two letters should be swapped in string *S*, so that the Hamming distance between a new string *S* and string *T* would be as small as possible, or otherwise, determine that such a replacement cannot reduce the distance between the strings.\n\nHelp him do this!\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200<=000) \u2014 the length of strings *S* and *T*.\n\nThe second line contains string *S*.\n\nThe third line contains string *T*.\n\nEach of the lines only contains lowercase Latin letters..

Complete the given code for the following problem: When new students come to the Specialized Educational and Scientific Centre (SESC) they need to start many things from the beginning. Sometimes the teachers say (not always unfairly) that we cannot even count. So our teachers decided to teach us arithmetics from the start. And what is the best way to teach students add and subtract? \u2014 That's right, using counting sticks! An here's our new task: \n\nAn expression of counting sticks is an expression of type:\n\nSign + consists of two crossed sticks: one vertical and one horizontal. Sign = consists of two horizontal sticks. The expression is arithmetically correct if *A*<=+<=*B*<==<=*C*.\n\nWe've got an expression that looks like *A*<=+<=*B*<==<=*C* given by counting sticks. Our task is to shift at most one stick (or we can shift nothing) so that the expression became arithmetically correct. Note that we cannot remove the sticks from the expression, also we cannot shift the sticks from the signs + and =.\n\nWe really aren't fabulous at arithmetics. Can you help us?\nInput specification: The single line contains the initial expression. It is guaranteed that the expression looks like *A*<=+<=*B*<==<=*C*, where 1<=\u2264<=*A*,<=*B*,<=*C*<=\u2264<=100.. Output specification: If there isn't a way to shift the stick so the expression becomes correct, print on a single line \"Impossible\" (without the quotes). If there is a way, print the resulting expression. Follow the format of the output from the test samples. Don't print extra space characters.\n\nIf there are multiple correct answers, print any of them. For clarifications, you are recommended to see the test samples.\nNote: In the first sample we can shift stick from the third group of sticks to the first one.\n\nIn the second sample we cannot shift vertical stick from + sign to the second group of sticks. So we cannot make a - sign.\n\nThere is no answer in the third sample because we cannot remove sticks from the expression.\n\nIn the forth sample the initial expression is already arithmetically correct and that is why we don't have to shift sticks.Complete the following code: ```python\ndef printer(a , b , c):\r\n\tans = \"\"\r\n\tfor i in range(int(a)):\r\n\t\tans += '|'\r\n\tans += '+'\r\n\tfor i in range(int(b)):\r\n\t\tans += '|'\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: Imagine that you have a twin brother or sister. Having another person that looks exactly like you seems very unusual. It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.\n\nNow let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins. The second line contains a sequence of *n* integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the coins' values. All numbers are separated with spaces.. Output specification: In the single line print the single number \u2014 the minimum needed number of coins.\nNote: In the first sample you will have to take 2 coins (you and your twin have sums equal to 6,\u20090 correspondingly). If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too. You can pick coins with values 1,\u20092 or 2,\u20092. In any case, the minimum number of coins equals 2.Complete the following code: ```python\ndef twins(n,values:list):\r\n    if  n ==1:\r\n        return n\r\n    elif n==2:\r\n        if values[0]==values[1]:\r\n            return n\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.

He decided to eat an equal amount of candies each morning until there are no more candies. However, Petya also noticed the box and decided to get some candies for himself.\n\nThis means the process of eating candies is the following: in the beginning Vasya chooses a single integer $k$, same for all days. After that, in the morning he eats $k$ candies from the box (if there are less than $k$ candies in the box, he eats them all), then in the evening Petya eats $10\\%$ of the candies remaining in the box.

That is, letters in pairs \"a\"-\"b\" and \"b\"-\"c\" are neighbouring, while letters \"a\"-\"c\" are not. \nVasya painted the resulting graph near the string and then erased the string. Next day Vasya's friend Petya came to a lecture and found some graph at his desk.

Complete the given code for the following problem: After getting kicked out of her reporting job for not knowing the alphabet, Bessie has decided to attend school at the Fillet and Eggs Eater Academy. She has been making good progress with her studies and now knows the first *k* English letters.\n\nEach morning, Bessie travels to school along a sidewalk consisting of *m*<=+<=*n* tiles. In order to help Bessie review, Mr. Moozing has labeled each of the first *m* sidewalk tiles with one of the first *k* lowercase English letters, spelling out a string *t*. Mr. Moozing, impressed by Bessie's extensive knowledge of farm animals, plans to let her finish labeling the last *n* tiles of the sidewalk by herself.\n\nConsider the resulting string *s* (|*s*|<==<=*m*<=+<=*n*) consisting of letters labeled on tiles in order from home to school. For any sequence of indices *p*1<=&lt;<=*p*2<=&lt;<=...<=&lt;<=*p**q* we can define subsequence of the string *s* as string *s**p*1*s**p*2... *s**p**q*. Two subsequences are considered to be distinct if they differ as strings. Bessie wants to label the remaining part of the sidewalk such that the number of distinct subsequences of tiles is maximum possible.

Output specification: Determine the maximum number of distinct subsequences Bessie can form after labeling the last *n* sidewalk tiles each with one of the first *k* lowercase English letters. Since this number can be rather large, you should print it modulo 109<=+<=7.\n\nPlease note, that you are not asked to maximize the remainder modulo 109<=+<=7! The goal is to maximize the initial value and then print the remainder.\nNote: In the first sample, the optimal labeling gives 8 different subsequences: \"\" (the empty string), \"a\", \"c\", \"b\", \"ac\", \"ab\", \"cb\", and \"acb\".\n\nIn the second sample, the entire sidewalk is already labeled. The are 10 possible different subsequences: \"\" (the empty string), \"a\", \"b\", \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aaa\", \"aab\", \"aba\", and \"aaba\". Note that some strings, including \"aa\", can be obtained with multiple sequences of tiles, but are only counted once.Complete the following code: ```python\nimport operator\r\ns = list(map(int,input().split()))\r\nn = s[0]\r\nk = s[1]\r\ns = input()\r\nm = len(s)\r\nbase = 10 ** 9 + 7\r\n\r\n```"}]}}

If there were 2 or say, 8 fingers shown, then his friend would clean the place.\n\nDima knows how many fingers each of his friends will show during the counting-out. Now he is interested in the number of ways to show some number of fingers on one hand (one to five), so that he did not have to clean the place. Help Dima.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of Dima's friends. Dima himself isn't considered to be his own friend. The second line contains *n* positive integers, not exceeding 5, representing, how many fingers the Dima's friends will show. \n\nThe numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.. Output specification: In a single line print the answer to the problem.\nNote: In the first sample Dima can show 1, 3 or 5 fingers. If Dima shows 3 fingers, then the counting-out will go like that: Dima, his friend, Dima, his friend.\n\nIn the second sample Dima can show 2 or 4 fingers.Complete the following code: ```python\n# https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/272/A\r\n\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: An African crossword is a rectangular table *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* in size. Each cell of the table contains exactly one letter. This table (it is also referred to as grid) contains some encrypted word that needs to be decoded.\n\nTo solve the crossword you should cross out all repeated letters in rows and columns. In other words, a letter should only be crossed out if and only if the corresponding column or row contains at least one more letter that is exactly the same. Besides, all such letters are crossed out simultaneously.\n\nWhen all repeated letters have been crossed out, we should write the remaining letters in a string. The letters that occupy a higher position follow before the letters that occupy a lower position. If the letters are located in one row, then the letter to the left goes first. The resulting word is the answer to the problem.\n\nYou are suggested to solve an African crossword and print the word encrypted there.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100). Next *n* lines contain *m* lowercase Latin letters each. That is the crossword grid.. Output specification: Print the encrypted word on a single line.

Complete the given code for the following problem: The translation from the Berland language into the Birland language is not an easy task. Those languages are very similar: a berlandish word differs from a birlandish word with the same meaning a little: it is spelled (and pronounced) reversely.

The king has already sent the message to all knights in the kingdom and they in turn agreed to participate in this grand event.\n\nAs for you, you're just a simple peasant. There's no surprise that you slept in this morning and were late for the tournament (it was a weekend, after all). Now you are really curious about the results of the tournament. This time the tournament in Berland went as follows:\n -  There are *n* knights participating in the tournament. Each knight was assigned his unique number \u2014 an integer from 1 to *n*. -  The tournament consisted of *m* fights, in the *i*-th fight the knights that were still in the game with numbers at least *l**i* and at most *r**i* have fought for the right to continue taking part in the tournament. -  After the *i*-th fight among all participants of the fight only one knight won \u2014 the knight number *x**i*, he continued participating in the tournament. Other knights left the tournament. -  The winner of the last (the *m*-th) fight (the knight number *x**m*) became the winner of the tournament. \nYou fished out all the information about the fights from your friends. Now for each knight you want to know the name of the knight he was conquered by. We think that the knight number *b* was conquered by the knight number *a*, if there was a fight with both of these knights present and the winner was the knight number *a*.\n\nWrite the code that calculates for each knight, the name of the knight that beat him.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n*, *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of knights and the number of fights.

Unfortunately, all soldiers died in the war and now the army consists of entirely new recruits, many of whom do not even know from which leg they should begin to march. The civilian population also poorly understands from which leg recruits begin to march, so it is only important how many soldiers march in step.\n\nThere will be *n* columns participating in the parade, the *i*-th column consists of *l**i* soldiers, who start to march from left leg, and *r**i* soldiers, who start to march from right leg.\n\nThe beauty of the parade is calculated by the following formula: if *L* is the total number of soldiers on the parade who start to march from the left leg, and *R* is the total number of soldiers on the parade who start to march from the right leg, so the beauty will equal |*L*<=-<=*R*|.\n\nNo more than once you can choose one column and tell all the soldiers in this column to switch starting leg, i.e. everyone in this columns who starts the march from left leg will now start it from right leg, and vice versa. Formally, you can pick no more than one index *i* and swap values *l**i* and *r**i*. \n\nFind the index of the column, such that switching the starting leg for soldiers in it will maximize the the beauty of the parade, or determine, that no such operation can increase the current beauty.\nInput specification: The first line contains single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of columns. \n\nThe next *n* lines contain the pairs of integers *l**i* and *r**i* (1<=\u2264<=*l**i*,<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=500)\u00a0\u2014 the number of soldiers in the *i*-th column which start to march from the left or the right leg respectively.. Output specification: Print single integer *k*\u00a0\u2014 the number of the column in which soldiers need to change the leg from which they start to march, or 0 if the maximum beauty is already reached.\n\nConsider that columns are numbered from 1 to *n* in the order they are given in the input data.\n\nIf there are several answers, print any of them.\nNote: In the first example if you don't give the order to change the leg, the number of soldiers, who start to march from the left leg, would equal 5\u2009+\u20098\u2009+\u200910\u2009=\u200923, and from the right leg\u00a0\u2014 6\u2009+\u20099\u2009+\u20093\u2009=\u200918. In this case the beauty of the parade will equal |23\u2009-\u200918|\u2009=\u20095.\n\nIf you give the order to change the leg to the third column, so the number of soldiers, who march from the left leg, will equal 5\u2009+\u20098\u2009+\u20093\u2009=\u200916, and who march from the right leg\u00a0\u2014 6\u2009+\u20099\u2009+\u200910\u2009=\u200925.

As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too.

Due to high seismic activity and poor weather conditions the satellites haven't yet been able to make clear shots of the monster. The analysis of the first shot resulted in an undirected graph with *n* vertices and *m* edges. Now the world's best minds are about to determine whether this graph can be regarded as Cthulhu or not.\n\nTo add simplicity, let's suppose that Cthulhu looks from the space like some spherical body with tentacles attached to it.

But it turns out to be pretty hard for her, because she is too young. Therefore, her brother Sergey always helps her.\n\nSergey gives Nastya the word *t* and wants to get the word *p* out of it. Nastya removes letters in a certain order (one after another, in this order strictly), which is specified by permutation of letters' indices of the word *t*: *a*1... *a*|*t*|. We denote the length of word *x* as |*x*|. Note that after removing one letter, the indices of other letters don't change. For example, if *t*<==<=\"nastya\" and *a*<==<=[4,<=1,<=5,<=3,<=2,<=6] then removals make the following sequence of words \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\".\n\nSergey knows this permutation. His goal is to stop his sister at some point and continue removing by himself to get the word *p*. Since Nastya likes this activity, Sergey wants to stop her as late as possible. Your task is to determine, how many letters Nastya can remove before she will be stopped by Sergey.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the word *p* can be obtained by removing the letters from word *t*.\nInput specification: The first and second lines of the input contain the words *t* and *p*, respectively.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Inna likes sweets and a game called the \"Candy Matrix\". Today, she came up with the new game \"Candy Matrix 2: Reload\".\n\nThe field for the new game is a rectangle table of size *n*<=\u00d7<=*m*. Each line of the table contains one cell with a dwarf figurine, one cell with a candy, the other cells of the line are empty. The game lasts for several moves. During each move the player should choose all lines of the matrix where dwarf is not on the cell with candy and shout \"Let's go!\". After that, all the dwarves from the chosen lines start to simultaneously move to the right. During each second, each dwarf goes to the adjacent cell that is located to the right of its current cell. The movement continues until one of the following events occurs:\n -  some dwarf in one of the chosen lines is located in the rightmost cell of his row; -  some dwarf in the chosen lines is located in the cell with the candy. \nThe point of the game is to transport all the dwarves to the candy cells.\n\nInna is fabulous, as she came up with such an interesting game. But what about you? Your task is to play this game optimally well. Specifically, you should say by the given game field what minimum number of moves the player needs to reach the goal of the game.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000;\u00a02<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000). \n\nNext *n* lines each contain *m* characters \u2014 the game field for the \"Candy Martix 2: Reload\".

Its peculiarity can be explained in following way: there are *n* inflorescences, numbered from 1 to *n*. Inflorescence number 1 is situated near base of tree and any other inflorescence with number *i* (*i*<=&gt;<=1) is situated at the top of branch, which bottom is *p**i*-th inflorescence and *p**i*<=&lt;<=*i*.\n\nOnce tree starts fruiting, there appears exactly one apple in each inflorescence. The same moment as apples appear, they start to roll down along branches to the very base of tree. Each second all apples, except ones in first inflorescence simultaneously roll down one branch closer to tree base, e.g. apple in *a*-th inflorescence gets to *p**a*-th inflorescence. Apples that end up in first inflorescence are gathered by Arcady in exactly the same moment. Second peculiarity of this tree is that once two apples are in same inflorescence they annihilate. This happens with each pair of apples, e.g. if there are 5 apples in same inflorescence in same time, only one will not be annihilated and if there are 8 apples, all apples will be annihilated. Thus, there can be no more than one apple in each inflorescence in each moment of time.\n\nHelp Arcady with counting number of apples he will be able to collect from first inflorescence during one harvest.\nInput specification: First line of input contains single integer number *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000) \u00a0\u2014 number of inflorescences.\n\nSecond line of input contains sequence of *n*<=-<=1 integer numbers *p*2,<=*p*3,<=...,<=*p**n* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=&lt;<=*i*), where *p**i* is number of inflorescence into which the apple from *i*-th inflorescence rolls down..

Other knights left the tournament. -  The winner of the last (the *m*-th) fight (the knight number *x**m*) became the winner of the tournament. \nYou fished out all the information about the fights from your friends. Now for each knight you want to know the name of the knight he was conquered by. We think that the knight number *b* was conquered by the knight number *a*, if there was a fight with both of these knights present and the winner was the knight number *a*.\n\nWrite the code that calculates for each knight, the name of the knight that beat him.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n*, *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of knights and the number of fights.

It is guaranteed that at least two knights took part in each battle.. Output specification: Print *n* integers. If the *i*-th knight lost, then the *i*-th number should equal the number of the knight that beat the knight number *i*. If the *i*-th knight is the winner, then the *i*-th number must equal 0.\nNote: Consider the first test case. Knights 1 and 2 fought the first fight and knight 1 won. Knights 1 and 3 fought the second fight and knight 3 won. The last fight was between knights 3 and 4, knight 4 won.Complete the following code: ```python\nimport sys\ndef input(): return sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nwin = [[] for i in range(n+1)]\nfor i in range(m-1):\n\tl, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\twin[l].append([x, i])\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: On the way home, Karen decided to stop by the supermarket to buy some groceries.\n\nShe needs to buy a lot of goods, but since she is a student her budget is still quite limited. In fact, she can only spend up to *b* dollars.\n\nThe supermarket sells *n* goods. The *i*-th good can be bought for *c**i* dollars. Of course, each good can only be bought once.\n\nLately, the supermarket has been trying to increase its business. Karen, being a loyal customer, was given *n* coupons. If Karen purchases the *i*-th good, she can use the *i*-th coupon to decrease its price by *d**i*. Of course, a coupon cannot be used without buying the corresponding good.\n\nThere is, however, a constraint with the coupons. For all *i*<=\u2265<=2, in order to use the *i*-th coupon, Karen must also use the *x**i*-th coupon (which may mean using even more coupons to satisfy the requirement for that coupon).\n\nKaren wants to know the following. What is the maximum number of goods she can buy, without exceeding her budget *b*?\nInput specification: The first line of input contains two integers *n* and *b* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=5000, 1<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=109), the number of goods in the store and the amount of money Karen has, respectively.\n\nThe next *n* lines describe the items.

Output specification: Output a single integer on a line by itself, the number of different goods Karen can buy, without exceeding her budget.\nNote: In the first test case, Karen can purchase the following 4 items:\n -  Use the first coupon to buy the first item for 10\u2009-\u20099\u2009=\u20091 dollar. -  Use the third coupon to buy the third item for 12\u2009-\u20092\u2009=\u200910 dollars. -  Use the fourth coupon to buy the fourth item for 20\u2009-\u200918\u2009=\u20092 dollars. -  Buy the sixth item for 2 dollars. \nThe total cost of these goods is 15, which falls within her budget. Note, for example, that she cannot use the coupon on the sixth item, because then she should have also used the fifth coupon to buy the fifth item, which she did not do here.\n\nIn the second test case, Karen has enough money to use all the coupons and purchase everything.Complete the following code: ```python\nimport sys\r\n\r\ndef rd(): return sys.stdin.readline().strip()\r\ndef rdl(typ,sep=\" \"): return list(map(typ, rd().split(sep)))\r\ndef wt(x,sep=\"\\n\") : sys.stdout.write(str(x) + sep)    # string / num\r\n\r\ndef treeOrdering2(n, adjList, root=0):  # order by depth\r\n    order = []\r\n```"}]}}

It states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. That got Nick's attention and he decided to invent a problem of his own and call it Noldbach problem. Since Nick is interested only in prime numbers, Noldbach problem states that at least *k* prime numbers from 2 to *n* inclusively can be expressed as the sum of three integer numbers: two neighboring prime numbers and 1. For example, 19 = 7 + 11 + 1, or 13 = 5 + 7 + 1.\n\nTwo prime numbers are called neighboring if there are no other prime numbers between them.\n\nYou are to help Nick, and find out if he is right or wrong.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000) and *k* (0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=1000).. Output specification: Output YES if at least *k* prime numbers from 2 to *n* inclusively can be expressed as it was described above. Otherwise output NO.\nNote: In the first sample the answer is YES since at least two numbers can be expressed as it was described (for example, 13 and 19).

Zuev wants to form the top-secret troop using *k* leftmost soldiers in the line, thus he wants their total loquacity to be as small as possible (as the troop should remain top-secret).

Complete the given code for the following problem: In a far away galaxy there are *n* inhabited planets, numbered with numbers from 1 to *n*. They are located at large distances from each other, that's why the communication between them was very difficult until on the planet number 1 a hyperdrive was invented. As soon as this significant event took place, *n*<=-<=1 spaceships were built on the planet number 1, and those ships were sent to other planets to inform about the revolutionary invention. \n\nParadoxical thought it may be, but the hyperspace is represented as simple three-dimensional Euclidean space. The inhabited planets may be considered fixed points in it, and no two points coincide and no three points lie on the same straight line. The movement of a ship with a hyperdrive between two planets is performed along a straight line at the constant speed, the same for all the ships. That's why the distance in the hyperspace are measured in hyperyears (a ship with a hyperdrive covers a distance of *s* hyperyears in *s* years).\n\nWhen the ship reaches an inhabited planet, the inhabitants of the planet dissemble it, make *n*<=-<=2 identical to it ships with a hyperdrive and send them to other *n*<=-<=2 planets (except for the one from which the ship arrived). The time to make a new ship compared to the time in which they move from one planet to another is so small that it can be disregarded. New ships are absolutely identical to the ones sent initially: they move at the same constant speed along a straight line trajectory and, having reached a planet, perform the very same mission, i.e. are dissembled to build new *n*<=-<=2 ships and send them to all the planets except for the one from which the ship arrived. Thus, the process of spreading the important news around the galaxy continues.\n\nHowever the hyperdrive creators hurried to spread the news about their invention so much that they didn't study completely what goes on when two ships collide in the hyperspace. If two moving ships find themselves at one point, they provoke an explosion of colossal power, leading to the destruction of the galaxy!\n\nYour task is to find the time the galaxy will continue to exist from the moment of the ships' launch from the first planet.\nInput specification: The first line contains a number *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=5000) \u2014 the number of inhabited planets in the galaxy.

But as there's virtually no time to do that, the soldiers lined up in the arbitrary order. However, the general is rather short-sighted and he thinks that the soldiers lined up correctly if the first soldier in the line has the maximum height and the last soldier has the minimum height. Please note that the way other solders are positioned does not matter, including the case when there are several soldiers whose height is maximum or minimum. Only the heights of the first and the last soldier are important.\n\nFor example, the general considers the sequence of heights (4, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1) correct and the sequence (4, 3, 1, 2, 2) wrong.\n\nWithin one second the colonel can swap any two neighboring soldiers.

Here the total profit equals $5 + 6 + 9 = 20$.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$) \u2014 the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$) \u2014 difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).. Output specification: In the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.\n\nIn the second line print exactly $k$ positive integers $t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$ ($t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$ must equal $n$), where $t_j$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $j$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.\n\nIf there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\nNote: The first example is described in the problem statement.\n\nIn the second example there is only one possible distribution.\n\nIn the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$. The total profit of this distribution is $2000 + 2000 = 4000$.Complete the following code: ```python\nimport heapq\r\n\r\ndef max_profit(arr, n , k):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Basically to find the overall profit, we can just use the heapq \r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    klargest = heapq.nlargest(k, arr)\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: Do you know the story about the three musketeers? Anyway, you must help them now.\n\nRichelimakieu is a cardinal in the city of Bearis. He found three brave warriors and called them the three musketeers. Athos has strength *a*, Borthos strength *b*, and Caramis has strength *c*.\n\nThe year 2015 is almost over and there are still *n* criminals to be defeated. The *i*-th criminal has strength *t**i*. It's hard to defeat strong criminals\u00a0\u2014 maybe musketeers will have to fight together to achieve it.\n\nRichelimakieu will coordinate musketeers' actions. In each hour each musketeer can either do nothing or be assigned to one criminal. Two or three musketeers can be assigned to the same criminal and then their strengths are summed up. A criminal can be defeated in exactly one hour (also if two or three musketeers fight him). Richelimakieu can't allow the situation where a criminal has strength bigger than the sum of strengths of musketeers fighting him\u00a0\u2014 a criminal would win then!\n\nIn other words, there are three ways to defeat a criminal.\n -  A musketeer of the strength *x* in one hour can defeat a criminal of the strength not greater than *x*. So, for example Athos in one hour can defeat criminal *i* only if *t**i*<=\u2264<=*a*. -  Two musketeers can fight together and in one hour defeat a criminal of the strength not greater than the sum of strengths of these two musketeers. So, for example Athos and Caramis in one hour can defeat criminal *i* only if *t**i*<=\u2264<=*a*<=+<=*c*. Note that the third remaining musketeer can either do nothing or fight some other criminal. -  Similarly, all three musketeers can fight together and in one hour defeat a criminal of the strength not greater than the sum of musketeers' strengths, i.e. *t**i*<=\u2264<=*a*<=+<=*b*<=+<=*c*. \nRichelimakieu doesn't want musketeers to fight during the New Year's Eve. Thus, he must coordinate their actions in order to minimize the number of hours till all criminals will be defeated.\n\nFind the minimum number of hours to defeat all criminals.

Otherwise, print the minimum number of hours the three musketeers will spend on defeating all criminals.\nNote: In the first sample Athos has strength 10, Borthos 20, and Caramis 30. They can defeat all criminals in two hours:\n -  Borthos and Caramis should together fight a criminal with strength 50. In the same hour Athos can fight one of four criminals with strength 1. -  There are three criminals left, each with strength 1. Each musketeer can fight one criminal in the second hour. \nIn the second sample all three musketeers must together fight a criminal with strength 51. It takes one hour.

Hitagi's sequence has been broken for a long time, but now Kaiki provides an opportunity.\n\nHitagi's sequence *a* has a length of *n*. Lost elements in it are denoted by zeros. Kaiki provides another sequence *b*, whose length *k* equals the number of lost elements in *a* (i.e. the number of zeros). Hitagi is to replace each zero in *a* with an element from *b* so that each element in *b* should be used exactly once. Hitagi knows, however, that, apart from 0, no integer occurs in *a* and *b* more than once in total.\n\nIf the resulting sequence is not an increasing sequence, then it has the power to recover Hitagi from the oddity. You are to determine whether this is possible, or Kaiki's sequence is just another fake.

Each cell of the table contains a single letter: \"D\", \"I\", \"M\", \"A\".\n\nInna loves Dima, so she wants to go through his name as many times as possible as she moves through the table. For that, Inna acts as follows:\n 1.  initially, Inna chooses some cell of the table where letter \"D\" is written; 1.  then Inna can move to some side-adjacent table cell that contains letter \"I\"; then from this cell she can go to one of the side-adjacent table cells that contains the written letter \"M\"; then she can go to a side-adjacent cell that contains letter \"A\". Then Inna assumes that she has gone through her sweetheart's name; 1.  Inna's next move can be going to one of the side-adjacent table cells that contains letter \"D\" and then walk on through name DIMA in the similar manner. Inna never skips a letter. So, from the letter \"D\" she always goes to the letter \"I\", from the letter \"I\" she always goes the to letter \"M\", from the letter \"M\" she always goes to the letter \"A\", and from the letter \"A\" she always goes to the letter \"D\". \nDepending on the choice of the initial table cell, Inna can go through name DIMA either an infinite number of times or some positive finite number of times or she can't go through his name once.

Valera is a smart guy, so he will be able to pass any exam he takes on his first try. Besides, he can take several exams on one day, and in any order.\n\nAccording to the schedule, a student can take the exam for the *i*-th subject on the day number *a**i*. However, Valera has made an arrangement with each teacher and the teacher of the *i*-th subject allowed him to take an exam before the schedule time on day *b**i* (*b**i*<=&lt;<=*a**i*). Thus, Valera can take an exam for the *i*-th subject either on day *a**i*, or on day *b**i*. All the teachers put the record of the exam in the student's record book on the day of the actual exam and write down the date of the mark as number *a**i*.\n\nValera believes that it would be rather strange if the entries in the record book did not go in the order of non-decreasing date. Therefore Valera asks you to help him. Find the minimum possible value of the day when Valera can take the final exam if he takes exams so that all the records in his record book go in the order of non-decreasing date.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=5000) \u2014 the number of exams Valera will take.\n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains two positive space-separated integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=&lt;<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the date of the exam in the schedule and the early date of passing the *i*-th exam, correspondingly.. Output specification: Print a single integer \u2014 the minimum possible number of the day when Valera can take the last exam if he takes all the exams so that all the records in his record book go in the order of non-decreasing date.\nNote: In the first sample Valera first takes an exam in the second subject on the first day (the teacher writes down the schedule date that is 3). On the next day he takes an exam in the third subject (the teacher writes down the schedule date, 4), then he takes an exam in the first subject (the teacher writes down the mark with date 5). Thus, Valera takes the last exam on the second day and the dates will go in the non-decreasing order: 3, 4, 5.\n\nIn the second sample Valera first takes an exam in the third subject on the fourth day. Then he takes an exam in the second subject on the fifth day. After that on the sixth day Valera takes an exam in the first subject.Complete the following code: ```python\ndef solve():\r\n    n = int(input().strip())\r\n\r\n    data = []\r\n    for i in range(n):\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: By 2312 there were *n* Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*)..

Its peculiarity can be explained in following way: there are *n* inflorescences, numbered from 1 to *n*. Inflorescence number 1 is situated near base of tree and any other inflorescence with number *i* (*i*<=&gt;<=1) is situated at the top of branch, which bottom is *p**i*-th inflorescence and *p**i*<=&lt;<=*i*.\n\nOnce tree starts fruiting, there appears exactly one apple in each inflorescence. The same moment as apples appear, they start to roll down along branches to the very base of tree. Each second all apples, except ones in first inflorescence simultaneously roll down one branch closer to tree base, e.g. apple in *a*-th inflorescence gets to *p**a*-th inflorescence. Apples that end up in first inflorescence are gathered by Arcady in exactly the same moment. Second peculiarity of this tree is that once two apples are in same inflorescence they annihilate. This happens with each pair of apples, e.g. if there are 5 apples in same inflorescence in same time, only one will not be annihilated and if there are 8 apples, all apples will be annihilated.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Mancala is a game famous in the Middle East. It is played on a board that consists of 14 holes. \n\nInitially, each hole has $a_i$ stones. When a player makes a move, he chooses a hole which contains a positive number of stones. He takes all the stones inside it and then redistributes these stones one by one in the next holes in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\nNote that the counter-clockwise order means if the player takes the stones from hole $i$, he will put one stone in the $(i+1)$-th hole, then in the $(i+2)$-th, etc. If he puts a stone in the $14$-th hole, the next one will be put in the first hole.\n\nAfter the move, the player collects all the stones from holes that contain even number of stones. The number of stones collected by player is the score, according to Resli.\n\nResli is a famous Mancala player.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Further research on zombie thought processes yielded interesting results. As we know from the previous problem, the nervous system of a zombie consists of *n* brains and *m* brain connectors joining some pairs of brains together. It was observed that the intellectual abilities of a zombie depend mainly on the topology of its nervous system. More precisely, we define the distance between two brains *u* and *v* (1<=\u2264<=*u*,<=*v*<=\u2264<=*n*) as the minimum number of brain connectors used when transmitting a thought between these two brains. The brain latency of a zombie is defined to be the maximum distance between any two of its brains. Researchers conjecture that the brain latency is the crucial parameter which determines how smart a given zombie is. Help them test this conjecture by writing a program to compute brain latencies of nervous systems.\n\nIn this problem you may assume that any nervous system given in the input is valid, i.e., it satisfies conditions (1) and (2) from the easy version.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100000) denoting the number of brains (which are conveniently numbered from 1 to *n*) and the number of brain connectors in the nervous system, respectively.

Complete the given code for the following problem: Little Petya often travels to his grandmother in the countryside. The grandmother has a large garden, which can be represented as a rectangle 1<=\u00d7<=*n* in size, when viewed from above. This rectangle is divided into *n* equal square sections. The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.\n\nCreating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section. At that, the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section. That is, for example, the garden can be represented by a 1<=\u00d7<=5 rectangle, where the section heights are equal to 4, 2, 3, 3, 2. Then if we create an artificial rain over any of the sections with the height of 3, the water will flow over all the sections, except the ones with the height of 4.

They've brought lots of shoe laces to the club and got tied with each other. Specifically, each string ties together two students. Besides, if two students are tied, then the lace connects the first student with the second one as well as the second student with the first one.\n\nTo restore order, Anna and Maria do the following. First, for each student Anna finds out what other students he is tied to. If a student is tied to exactly one other student, Anna reprimands him. Then Maria gathers in a single group all the students who have been just reprimanded. She kicks them out from the club. This group of students immediately leaves the club. These students takes with them the laces that used to tie them. Then again for every student Anna finds out how many other students he is tied to and so on.

After that Timofey brings the tree to a trash can.\n\nTimofey doesn't like it when many colors are mixing together. A subtree annoys him if there are vertices of different color in it. Timofey wants to find a vertex which he should take in hands so that there are no subtrees that annoy him.

It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.\n\nNow let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins. The second line contains a sequence of *n* integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the coins' values. All numbers are separated with spaces.. Output specification: In the single line print the single number \u2014 the minimum needed number of coins.\nNote: In the first sample you will have to take 2 coins (you and your twin have sums equal to 6,\u20090 correspondingly). If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too. You can pick coins with values 1,\u20092 or 2,\u20092. In any case, the minimum number of coins equals 2.Complete the following code: ```python\nn = int(input())\r\ncoins = [int(i) for i in input().split()]\r\ncoins.sort(reverse = True)\r\narr = []\r\n\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: Recently, Mike was very busy with studying for exams and contests. Now he is going to chill a bit by doing some sight seeing in the city.\n\nCity consists of *n* intersections numbered from 1 to *n*. Mike starts walking from his house located at the intersection number 1 and goes along some sequence of intersections. Walking from intersection number *i* to intersection *j* requires |*i*<=-<=*j*| units of energy. The total energy spent by Mike to visit a sequence of intersections *p*1<==<=1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**k* is equal to  units of energy.\n\nOf course, walking would be boring if there were no shortcuts. A shortcut is a special path that allows Mike walking from one intersection to another requiring only 1 unit of energy. There are exactly *n* shortcuts in Mike's city, the *i**th* of them allows walking from intersection *i* to intersection *a**i* (*i*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=+<=1) (but not in the opposite direction), thus there is exactly one shortcut starting at each intersection. Formally, if Mike chooses a sequence *p*1<==<=1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**k* then for each 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*k* satisfying *p**i*<=+<=1<==<=*a**p**i* and *a**p**i*<=\u2260<=*p**i* Mike will spend only 1 unit of energy instead of |*p**i*<=-<=*p**i*<=+<=1| walking from the intersection *p**i* to intersection *p**i*<=+<=1. For example, if Mike chooses a sequence *p*1<==<=1,<=*p*2<==<=*a**p*1,<=*p*3<==<=*a**p*2,<=...,<=*p**k*<==<=*a**p**k*<=-<=1, he spends exactly *k*<=-<=1 units of total energy walking around them.\n\nBefore going on his adventure, Mike asks you to find the minimum amount of energy required to reach each of the intersections from his home. Formally, for each 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n* Mike is interested in finding minimum possible total energy of some sequence *p*1<==<=1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**k*<==<=*i*.\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of Mike's city intersection.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (*i*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n* , , describing shortcuts of Mike's city, allowing to walk from intersection *i* to intersection *a**i* using only 1 unit of energy.

He jumped on the bed and threw pillows all day long, until... \n\nToday Petya opened the cupboard and found a scary note there. His parents had left him with duties: he should water their favourite flower all year, each day, in the morning, in the afternoon and in the evening. \"Wait a second!\" \u2014 thought Petya. He know for a fact that if he fulfills the parents' task in the *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=12) month of the year, then the flower will grow by *a**i* centimeters, and if he doesn't water the flower in the *i*-th month, then the flower won't grow this month. Petya also knows that try as he might, his parents won't believe that he has been watering the flower if it grows strictly less than by *k* centimeters. \n\nHelp Petya choose the minimum number of months when he will water the flower, given that the flower should grow no less than by *k* centimeters.\nInput specification: The first line contains exactly one integer *k* (0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=100).

The *i*-th recipe suggests that coffee should be brewed between *l**i* and *r**i* degrees, inclusive, to achieve the optimal taste.\n\nKaren thinks that a temperature is admissible if at least *k* recipes recommend it.\n\nKaren has a rather fickle mind, and so she asks *q* questions. In each question, given that she only wants to prepare coffee with a temperature between *a* and *b*, inclusive, can you tell her how many admissible integer temperatures fall within the range?\nInput specification: The first line of input contains three integers, *n*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200000), and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=200000), the number of recipes, the minimum number of recipes a certain temperature must be recommended by to be admissible, and the number of questions Karen has, respectively.\n\nThe next *n* lines describe the recipes. Specifically, the *i*-th line among these contains two integers *l**i* and *r**i* (1<=\u2264<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=200000), describing that the *i*-th recipe suggests that the coffee be brewed between *l**i* and *r**i* degrees, inclusive.\n\nThe next *q* lines describe the questions. Each of these lines contains *a* and *b*, (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=200000), describing that she wants to know the number of admissible integer temperatures between *a* and *b* degrees, inclusive.. Output specification: For each question, output a single integer on a line by itself, the number of admissible integer temperatures between *a* and *b* degrees, inclusive.\nNote: In the first test case, Karen knows 3 recipes.\n 1.  The first one recommends brewing the coffee between 91 and 94 degrees, inclusive. 1.  The second one recommends brewing the coffee between 92 and 97 degrees, inclusive. 1.  The third one recommends brewing the coffee between 97 and 99 degrees, inclusive. \nA temperature is admissible if at least 2 recipes recommend it.\n\nShe asks 4 questions.\n\nIn her first question, she wants to know the number of admissible integer temperatures between 92 and 94 degrees, inclusive. There are 3: 92, 93 and 94 degrees are all admissible.\n\nIn her second question, she wants to know the number of admissible integer temperatures between 93 and 97 degrees, inclusive. There are 3: 93, 94 and 97 degrees are all admissible.\n\nIn her third question, she wants to know the number of admissible integer temperatures between 95 and 96 degrees, inclusive. There are none.\n\nIn her final question, she wants to know the number of admissible integer temperatures between 90 and 100 degrees, inclusive. There are 4: 92, 93, 94 and 97 degrees are all admissible.\n\nIn the second test case, Karen knows 2 recipes.\n 1.  The first one, \"wikiHow to make Cold Brew Coffee\", recommends brewing the coffee at exactly 1 degree. 1.  The second one, \"What good is coffee that isn't brewed at at least 36.3306 times the temperature of the surface of the sun?\", recommends brewing the coffee at exactly 200000 degrees. \nA temperature is admissible if at least 1 recipe recommends it.\n\nIn her first and only question, she wants to know the number of admissible integer temperatures that are actually reasonable. There are none.Complete the following code: ```python\ndef solve(re, we, qu):\r\n    dp = [0] * 200000\r\n    for i in range(len(we)):\r\n        a,b=we[i][0],we[i][1]\r\n        dp[a]+=1\r\n        dp[b+1]-=1\r\n    for i in range(1, len(dp)):\r\n        dp[i]+=dp[i-1]\r\n```"}]}}

In other words, from position (*x*,<=*y*) he can go to positions (*x*<=+<=1,<=*y*), (*x*<=-<=1,<=*y*), (*x*,<=*y*<=+<=1) or (*x*,<=*y*<=-<=1). \n\nUnfortunately, Drazil doesn't have sense of direction. So he randomly chooses the direction he will go to in each step. He may accidentally return back to his house during his travel. Drazil may even not notice that he has arrived to (*a*,<=*b*) and continue travelling. \n\nLuckily, Drazil arrived to the position (*a*,<=*b*) successfully. Drazil said to Varda: \"It took me exactly *s* steps to travel from my house to yours\". But Varda is confused about his words, she is not sure that it is possible to get from (0,<=0) to (*a*,<=*b*) in exactly *s* steps. Can you find out if it is possible for Varda?\nInput specification: You are given three integers *a*, *b*, and *s* (<=-<=109<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=109, 1<=\u2264<=*s*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7109) in a single line.. Output specification: If you think Drazil made a mistake and it is impossible to take exactly *s* steps and get from his home to Varda's home, print \"No\" (without quotes).\n\nOtherwise, print \"Yes\".\nNote: In fourth sample case one possible route is: <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/0d30660ddf6eb6c64ffd071055a4e8ddd016cde5.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>.Complete the following code: ```python\n\r\n\r\ndef main():\r\n```"}]}}

Then at moment (*t*<=+<=1) this star will have brightness *x*<=+<=1, if *x*<=+<=1<=\u2264<=*c*, and 0, otherwise.\n\nYou want to look at the sky *q* times. In the *i*-th time you will look at the moment *t**i* and you will see a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the lower left corner has coordinates (*x*1*i*, *y*1*i*) and the upper right\u00a0\u2014 (*x*2*i*, *y*2*i*).

Complete the given code for the following problem: New Year is coming in Line World! In this world, there are *n* cells numbered by integers from 1 to *n*, as a 1<=\u00d7<=*n* board. People live in cells. However, it was hard to move between distinct cells, because of the difficulty of escaping the cell. People wanted to meet people who live in other cells.\n\nSo, user tncks0121 has made a transportation system to move between these cells, to celebrate the New Year. First, he thought of *n*<=-<=1 positive integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1. For every integer *i* where 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1 the condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* holds. Next, he made *n*<=-<=1 portals, numbered by integers from 1 to *n*<=-<=1.

Print \"Tie\" (without quotes) if Limak and Radewoosh will get the same total number of points.\nNote: In the first sample, there are 3 problems. Limak solves them as follows:\n 1.  Limak spends 10 minutes on the 1-st problem and he gets 50\u2009-\u2009*c*\u00b710\u2009=\u200950\u2009-\u20092\u00b710\u2009=\u200930 points. 1.  Limak spends 15 minutes on the 2-nd problem so he submits it 10\u2009+\u200915\u2009=\u200925 minutes after the start of the contest. For the 2-nd problem he gets 85\u2009-\u20092\u00b725\u2009=\u200935 points. 1.  He spends 25 minutes on the 3-rd problem so he submits it 10\u2009+\u200915\u2009+\u200925\u2009=\u200950 minutes after the start. For this problem he gets 250\u2009-\u20092\u00b750\u2009=\u2009150 points. \nSo, Limak got 30\u2009+\u200935\u2009+\u2009150\u2009=\u2009215 points.\n\nRadewoosh solves problem in the reversed order:\n 1.  Radewoosh solves 3-rd problem after 25 minutes so he gets 250\u2009-\u20092\u00b725\u2009=\u2009200 points. 1.  He spends 15 minutes on the 2-nd problem so he submits it 25\u2009+\u200915\u2009=\u200940 minutes after the start. He gets 85\u2009-\u20092\u00b740\u2009=\u20095 points for this problem. 1.  He spends 10 minutes on the 1-st problem so he submits it 25\u2009+\u200915\u2009+\u200910\u2009=\u200950 minutes after the start. He gets *max*(0,\u200950\u2009-\u20092\u00b750)\u2009=\u2009*max*(0,\u2009\u2009-\u200950)\u2009=\u20090 points. \nRadewoosh got 200\u2009+\u20095\u2009+\u20090\u2009=\u2009205 points in total. Limak has 215 points so Limak wins.\n\nIn the second sample, Limak will get 0 points for each problem and Radewoosh will first solve the hardest problem and he will get 250\u2009-\u20096\u00b725\u2009=\u2009100 points for that. Radewoosh will get 0 points for other two problems but he is the winner anyway.\n\nIn the third sample, Limak will get 2 points for the 1-st problem and 2 points for the 2-nd problem.

For example, imagine Ciel has three boxes: the first has strength 2, the second has strength 1 and the third has strength 1. She cannot put the second and the third box simultaneously directly on the top of the first one. But she can put the second box directly on the top of the first one, and then the third box directly on the top of the second one.

He descends into the subway at some time, waits the first train to come and rides on it to the end of the branch to the corresponding girl. However, the trains run with different frequencies: a train goes to Dasha's direction every *a* minutes, but a train goes to Masha's direction every *b* minutes. If two trains approach at the same time, Vasya goes toward the direction with the lower frequency of going trains, that is, to the girl, to whose directions the trains go less frequently (see the note to the third sample).\n\nWe know that the trains begin to go simultaneously before Vasya appears.

Let the trains start to go at the zero moment of time. It is clear that the moments of the trains' arrival will be periodic with period 6. That's why it is enough to show that if Vasya descends to the subway at a moment of time inside the interval (0,\u20096], he will go to both girls equally often. \n\nIf he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 0 to 2, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the second minute.\n\nIf he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 2 to 3, he leaves for Masha on the train that arrives by the third minute.\n\nIf he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 3 to 4, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the fourth minute.\n\nIf he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 4 to 6, he waits for both trains to arrive by the sixth minute and goes to Masha as trains go less often in Masha's direction.\n\nIn sum Masha and Dasha get equal time \u2014 three minutes for each one, thus, Vasya will go to both girlfriends equally often.Complete the following code: ```python\nfrom math import gcd\r\n\r\n\r\ndef lcm(a, b):\r\n    return a * b // gcd(a, b)\r\n\r\n\r\ndef main():\r\n```"}]}}

Lolek and Bolek have not stood in the queue yet, but they are already wondering what is the maximum and the minimum number of zlotys the airport administration can earn if all *n* passengers buy tickets according to the conditions of this offer?\n\nThe passengers buy tickets in turn, the first person in the queue goes first, then goes the second one, and so on up to *n*-th person.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the number of passengers in the queue and the number of planes in the airport, correspondingly. The next line contains *m* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**m* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 *a**i* stands for the number of empty seats in the *i*-th plane before the ticket office starts selling tickets.\n\nThe numbers in the lines are separated by a space. It is guaranteed that there are at least *n* empty seats in total.. Output specification: Print two integers \u2014 the maximum and the minimum number of zlotys that the airport administration can earn, correspondingly.\nNote: In the first test sample the number of passengers is equal to the number of empty seats, so regardless of the way the planes are chosen, the administration will earn the same sum.\n\nIn the second sample the sum is maximized if the 1-st person in the queue buys a ticket to the 1-st plane, the 2-nd person \u2014 to the 2-nd plane, the 3-rd person \u2014 to the 3-rd plane, the 4-th person \u2014 to the 1-st plane. The sum is minimized if the 1-st person in the queue buys a ticket to the 1-st plane, the 2-nd person \u2014 to the 1-st plane, the 3-rd person \u2014 to the 2-nd plane, the 4-th person \u2014 to the 2-nd plane.Complete the following code: ```python\ndef indmin(X,n):\n    minn=X[0]\n    ind=0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if(X[i]<minn):\n            minn=X[i]\n            ind=i\n    return ind\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: Dasha logged into the system and began to solve problems. One of them is as follows:\n\nGiven two sequences *a* and *b* of length *n* each you need to write a sequence *c* of length *n*, the *i*-th element of which is calculated as follows: *c**i*<==<=*b**i*<=-<=*a**i*.\n\nAbout sequences *a* and *b* we know that their elements are in the range from *l* to *r*. More formally, elements satisfy the following conditions: *l*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*r* and *l*<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*r*. About sequence *c* we know that all its elements are distinct.\n\nDasha wrote a solution to that problem quickly, but checking her work on the standard test was not so easy. Due to an error in the test system only the sequence *a* and the compressed sequence of the sequence *c* were known from that test.\n\nLet's give the definition to a compressed sequence. A compressed sequence of sequence *c* of length *n* is a sequence *p* of length *n*, so that *p**i* equals to the number of integers which are less than or equal to *c**i* in the sequence *c*. For example, for the sequence *c*<==<=[250,<=200,<=300,<=100,<=50] the compressed sequence will be *p*<==<=[4,<=3,<=5,<=2,<=1]. Pay attention that in *c* all integers are distinct. Consequently, the compressed sequence contains all integers from 1 to *n* inclusively.\n\nHelp Dasha to find any sequence *b* for which the calculated compressed sequence of sequence *c* is correct.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *l*, *r* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105,<=1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=*r*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the length of the sequence and boundaries of the segment where the elements of sequences *a* and *b* are.\n\nThe next line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=<=*a*2,<=<=...,<=<=*a**n* (*l*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*r*) \u2014 the elements of the sequence *a*.\n\nThe next line contains *n* distinct integers *p*1,<=<=*p*2,<=<=...,<=<=*p**n* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the compressed sequence of the sequence *c*.. Output specification: If there is no the suitable sequence *b*, then in the only line print \"-1\".\n\nOtherwise, in the only line print *n* integers \u2014 the elements of any suitable sequence *b*.\nNote: Sequence *b* which was found in the second sample is suitable, because calculated sequence *c*\u2009=\u2009[2\u2009-\u20093,\u20092\u2009-\u20094,\u20092\u2009-\u20098,\u20099\u2009-\u20099]\u2009=\u2009[\u2009-\u20091,\u2009\u2009-\u20092,\u2009\u2009-\u20096,\u20090] (note that *c*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*</sub>\u2009=\u2009*b*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*</sub>\u2009-\u2009*a*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*</sub>) has compressed sequence equals to *p*\u2009=\u2009[3,\u20092,\u20091,\u20094].Complete the following code: ```python\n#! /usr/bin/env python\r\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\r\nr\"\"\"\r\nExcited Nasy!\r\n\r\nO._.O\r\n(\\=/)\r\n\r\n```"}]}}

I. e. each of *n* universes has one Rick and one Morty. They're gathering in *m* groups. Each person can be in many groups and a group can contain an arbitrary number of members.\n\nRicks and Mortys have registered online in these groups. So, a person can have joined a group more than once (developer of this website hadn't considered this possibility).\n\nSummer from universe #1 knows that in each parallel universe (including hers) exactly one of Rick and Morty from that universe is a traitor and is loyal, but no one knows which one. She knows that we are doomed if there's a group such that every member in that group is a traitor (they will plan and destroy the world). \n\nSummer knows that if there's a possibility that world ends (there's a group where all members are traitors) she should immediately cancel this event.

When Dima wants to send Inna some sentence, he writes out all words, inserting a heart before each word and after the last word. A heart is a sequence of two characters: the \"less\" characters (&lt;) and the digit three (3). After applying the code, a test message looks like that: &lt;3*word*1&lt;3*word*2&lt;3 ... *word**n*&lt;3.\n\nEncoding doesn't end here.

The worst mark is 1, the best is *k*. Mark that is going to the certificate, is calculated as an average of all the marks, rounded to the closest integer. If several answers are possible, rounding up is produced. For example, 7.3 is rounded to 7, but 7.5 and 7.8784\u00a0\u2014 to 8. \n\nFor instance, if Noora has marks [8,<=9], then the mark to the certificate is 9, because the average is equal to 8.5 and rounded to 9, but if the marks are [8,<=8,<=9], Noora will have graduation certificate with 8.\n\nTo graduate with \u00abA\u00bb certificate, Noora has to have mark *k*.\n\nNoora got *n* marks in register this year.

Alice and Bob have many slices of pie, and rather than cutting the slices in half, each individual slice will be eaten by just one person.\n\nThe way Alice and Bob decide who eats each slice is as follows. First, the order in which the pies are to be handed out is decided. There is a special token called the \"decider\" token, initially held by Bob. Until all the pie is handed out, whoever has the decider token will give the next slice of pie to one of the participants, and the decider token to the other participant. They continue until no slices of pie are left.\n\nAll of the slices are of excellent quality, so each participant obviously wants to maximize the total amount of pie they get to eat.

Simon receives number *a* and Antisimon receives number *b*. They also have a heap of *n* stones. The players take turns to make a move and Simon starts. During a move a player should take from the heap the number of stones equal to the greatest common divisor of the fixed number he has received and the number of stones left in the heap.

Now he is going to chill a bit by doing some sight seeing in the city.\n\nCity consists of *n* intersections numbered from 1 to *n*. Mike starts walking from his house located at the intersection number 1 and goes along some sequence of intersections.

A shortcut is a special path that allows Mike walking from one intersection to another requiring only 1 unit of energy. There are exactly *n* shortcuts in Mike's city, the *i**th* of them allows walking from intersection *i* to intersection *a**i* (*i*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=+<=1) (but not in the opposite direction), thus there is exactly one shortcut starting at each intersection.

The *i*-th line contains either \"+*a**i*\" (without the quotes), if the suspect number *i* says that the crime was committed by suspect number *a**i*, or \"-*a**i*\" (without the quotes), if the suspect number *i* says that the suspect number *a**i* didn't commit the crime (*a**i* is an integer, 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*).\n\nIt is guaranteed that at least one suspect exists, such that if he committed the crime, then exactly *m* people told the truth.. Output specification: Print *n* lines. Line number *i* should contain \"Truth\" if suspect number *i* has told the truth for sure. Print \"Lie\" if the suspect number *i* lied for sure and print \"Not defined\" if he could lie and could tell the truth, too, depending on who committed the crime.\nNote: The first sample has the single person and he confesses to the crime, and Sherlock Holmes knows that one person is telling the truth. That means that this person is telling the truth.\n\nIn the second sample there are three suspects and each one denies his guilt. Sherlock Holmes knows that only two of them are telling the truth. Any one of them can be the criminal, so we don't know for any of them, whether this person is telling the truth or not.\n\nIn the third sample the second and the fourth suspect defend the first and the third one. But only one is telling the truth, thus, the first or the third one is the criminal. Both of them can be criminals, so the second and the fourth one can either be lying or telling the truth. The first and the third one are lying for sure as they are blaming the second and the fourth one.Complete the following code: ```python\nimport random\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom functools import lru_cache\nfrom math import inf\n\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2 * 10 ** 6)\n\n```"}]}}

The education is not easy because you need to have fundamental knowledge in different areas, which sometimes are not related to each other. \n\nFor example, you should know linguistics very well. You learn a structure of Reberland language as foreign language. In this language words are constructed according to the following rules. First you need to choose the \"root\" of the word \u2014 some string which has more than 4 letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3 symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction \u2014  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row.

You are given the word *s*. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language. \n\nTwo strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match. \n\nLet's look at the example: the word *abacabaca* is given. This word can be obtained in the following ways: , where the root of the word is overlined, and suffixes are marked by \"corners\". Thus, the set of possible suffixes for this word is {*aca*,<=*ba*,<=*ca*}.\nInput specification: The only line contains a string *s* (5<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=104) consisting of lowercase English letters..

To do this, there is an inventory number assigned with each item. It is much easier to create a database by using those numbers and keep the track of everything.\n\nDuring an audit, you were surprised to find out that the items are not numbered sequentially, and some items even share the same inventory number! There is an urgent need to fix it. You have chosen to make the numbers of the items sequential, starting with 1. Changing a number is quite a time-consuming process, and you would like to make maximum use of the current numbering.\n\nYou have been given information on current inventory numbers for *n* items in the company. Renumber items so that their inventory numbers form a permutation of numbers from 1 to *n* by changing the number of as few items as possible. Let us remind you that a set of *n* numbers forms a permutation if all the numbers are in the range from 1 to *n*, and no two numbers are equal.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n*\u00a0\u2014 the number of items (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105).\n\nThe second line contains *n* numbers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the initial inventory numbers of the items..

The state which secrets Gerald is selling, has no paper money, only coins. But there are coins of all positive integer denominations that are powers of three: 1 mark, 3 marks, 9 marks, 27 marks and so on. There are no coins of other denominations. Of course, Gerald likes it when he gets money without the change. And all buyers respect him and try to give the desired sum without change, if possible. But this does not always happen.\n\nOne day an unlucky buyer came. He did not have the desired sum without change. Then he took out all his coins and tried to give Gerald a larger than necessary sum with as few coins as possible. What is the maximum number of coins he could get?\n\nThe formal explanation of the previous paragraph: we consider all the possible combinations of coins for which the buyer can not give Gerald the sum of *n* marks without change. For each such combination calculate the minimum number of coins that can bring the buyer at least *n* marks. Among all combinations choose the maximum of the minimum number of coins.

People live in cells. However, it was hard to move between distinct cells, because of the difficulty of escaping the cell. People wanted to meet people who live in other cells.\n\nSo, user tncks0121 has made a transportation system to move between these cells, to celebrate the New Year. First, he thought of *n*<=-<=1 positive integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1. For every integer *i* where 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1 the condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* holds. Next, he made *n*<=-<=1 portals, numbered by integers from 1 to *n*<=-<=1. The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) portal connects cell *i* and cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*), and one can travel from cell *i* to cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) using the *i*-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) to cell *i* using the *i*-th portal. It is easy to see that because of condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* one can't leave the Line World using portals.\n\nCurrently, I am standing at cell 1, and I want to go to cell *t*. However, I don't know whether it is possible to go there. Please determine whether I can go to cell *t* by only using the construted transportation system.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3<=\u00d7<=104) and *t* (2<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of cells, and the index of the cell which I want to go to.\n\nThe second line contains *n*<=-<=1 space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1 (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i*).

One day Fedor came up with such a problem.\n\nYou are given an array *a* consisting of *n* positive integers and queries to it. The queries can be of two types:\n 1.  Make a unit cyclic shift to the right on the segment from *l* to *r* (both borders inclusive). That is rearrange elements of the array in the following manner:*a*[*l*],<=*a*[*l*<=+<=1],<=...,<=*a*[*r*<=-<=1],<=*a*[*r*]<=\u2192<=*a*[*r*],<=*a*[*l*],<=*a*[*l*<=+<=1],<=...,<=*a*[*r*<=-<=1].1.  Count how many numbers equal to *k* are on the segment from *l* to *r* (both borders inclusive). \nFedor hurried to see Serega enjoy the problem and Serega solved it really quickly.

The next *q* lines contain the queries.\n\nAs you need to respond to the queries online, the queries will be encoded. A query of the first type will be given in format: 1 *l*'*i* *r*'*i*. A query of the second type will be given in format: 2 *l*'*i* *r*'*i* *k*'*i*. All the number in input are integer. They satisfy the constraints: 1<=\u2264<=*l*'*i*,<=*r*'*i*,<=*k*'*i*<=\u2264<=*n*.\n\nTo decode the queries from the data given in input, you need to perform the following transformations:\n\nWhere *lastans* is the last reply to the query of the 2-nd type (initially, *lastans*<==<=0). If after transformation *l**i* is greater than *r**i*, you must swap these values..

Complete the given code for the following problem: Greg has a weighed directed graph, consisting of *n* vertices. In this graph any pair of distinct vertices has an edge between them in both directions. Greg loves playing with the graph and now he has invented a new game:\n -  The game consists of *n* steps. -  On the *i*-th step Greg removes vertex number *x**i* from the graph. As Greg removes a vertex, he also removes all the edges that go in and out of this vertex. -  Before executing each step, Greg wants to know the sum of lengths of the shortest paths between all pairs of the remaining vertices. The shortest path can go through any remaining vertex. In other words, if we assume that *d*(*i*,<=*v*,<=*u*) is the shortest path between vertices *v* and *u* in the graph that formed before deleting vertex *x**i*, then Greg wants to know the value of the following sum: . \nHelp Greg, print the value of the required sum before each step.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=500) \u2014 the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nNext *n* lines contain *n* integers each \u2014 the graph adjacency matrix: the *j*-th number in the *i*-th line *a**ij* (1<=\u2264<=*a**ij*<=\u2264<=105,<=*a**ii*<==<=0) represents the weight of the edge that goes from vertex *i* to vertex *j*.\n\nThe next line contains *n* distinct integers: *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n* (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the vertices that Greg deletes..

Complete the given code for the following problem: Ahmed and Mostafa used to compete together in many programming contests for several years. Their coach Fegla asked them to solve one challenging problem, of course Ahmed was able to solve it but Mostafa couldn't.\n\nThis problem is similar to a standard problem but it has a different format and constraints.\n\nIn the standard problem you are given an array of integers, and you have to find one or more consecutive elements in this array where their sum is the maximum possible sum.\n\nBut in this problem you are given *n* small arrays, and you will create one big array from the concatenation of one or more instances of the small arrays (each small array could occur more than once). The big array will be given as an array of indexes (1-based) of the small arrays, and the concatenation should be done in the same order as in this array. Then you should apply the standard problem mentioned above on the resulting big array.\n\nFor example let's suppose that the small arrays are {1, 6, -2}, {3, 3} and {-5, 1}. And the indexes in the big array are {2, 3, 1, 3}. So the actual values in the big array after formatting it as concatenation of the small arrays will be {3, 3, -5, 1, 1, 6, -2, -5, 1}. In this example the maximum sum is 9.\n\nCan you help Mostafa solve this problem?\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m*, *n* is the number of the small arrays (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50), and *m* is the number of indexes in the big array (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=250000). Then follow *n* lines, the *i*-th line starts with one integer *l* which is the size of the *i*-th array (1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=5000), followed by *l* integers each one will be greater than or equal -1000 and less than or equal 1000. The last line contains *m* integers which are the indexes in the big array, and you should concatenate the small arrays in the same order, and each index will be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to *n*.\n\nThe small arrays are numbered from 1 to *n* in the same order as given in the input. Some of the given small arrays may not be used in big array.\n\nNote, that the array is very big. So if you try to build it straightforwardly, you will probably get time or/and memory limit exceeded.. Output specification: Print one line containing the maximum sum in the big array after formatting it as described above. You must choose at least one element for the sum, i. e. it cannot be empty.\n\nPlease, do not use %lld specificator to write 64-bit integers in C++.

Your task is to say if the hidden number is prime or composite.\n\nInteger *x*<=&gt;<=1 is called prime if it has exactly two distinct divisors, 1 and *x*. If integer *x*<=&gt;<=1 is not prime, it's called composite.\n\nYou can ask up to 20 queries about divisors of the hidden number. In each query you should print an integer from interval [2,<=100]. The system will answer \"yes\" if your integer is a divisor of the hidden number. Otherwise, the answer will be \"no\".\n\nFor example, if the hidden number is 14 then the system will answer \"yes\" only if you print 2, 7 or 14.\n\nWhen you are done asking queries, print \"prime\" or \"composite\" and terminate your program.\n\nYou will get the Wrong Answer verdict if you ask more than 20 queries, or if you print an integer not from the range [2,<=100].

After flushing you should read a response from the input.\n\nIn any moment you can print the answer \"prime\" or \"composite\" (without the quotes). After that, flush the output and terminate your program.\n\nTo flush you can use (just after printing an integer and end-of-line): \n -  fflush(stdout) in C++; -  System.out.flush() in Java; -  stdout.flush() in Python; -  flush(output) in Pascal; -  See the documentation for other languages. \nHacking.

At the first stage of elections the votes are counted for each city: it is assumed that in each city won the candidate who got the highest number of votes in this city, and if several candidates got the maximum number of votes, then the winner is the one with a smaller index.\n\nAt the second stage of elections the winner is determined by the same principle over the cities: the winner of the elections is the candidate who won in the maximum number of cities, and among those who got the maximum number of cities the winner is the one with a smaller index.\n\nDetermine who will win the elections.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n*, *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of candidates and of cities, respectively.\n\nEach of the next *m* lines contains *n* non-negative integers, the *j*-th number in the *i*-th line *a**ij* (1<=\u2264<=*j*<=\u2264<=*n*, 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*m*, 0<=\u2264<=*a**ij*<=\u2264<=109) denotes the number of votes for candidate *j* in city *i*.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total number of people in all the cities does not exceed 109.. Output specification: Print a single number \u2014 the index of the candidate who won the elections. The candidates are indexed starting from one.\nNote: Note to the first sample test. At the first stage city 1 chosen candidate 3, city 2 chosen candidate 2, city 3 chosen candidate 2. The winner is candidate 2, he gained 2 votes.\n\nNote to the second sample test. At the first stage in city 1 candidates 1 and 2 got the same maximum number of votes, but candidate 1 has a smaller index, so the city chose candidate 1. City 2 chosen candidate 3. City 3 chosen candidate 1, due to the fact that everyone has the same number of votes, and 1 has the smallest index. City 4 chosen the candidate 3. On the second stage the same number of cities chose candidates 1 and 3. The winner is candidate 1, the one with the smaller index.Complete the following code: ```python\nfrom sys import stdin; inp = stdin.readline\r\nfrom math import dist, ceil, floor, sqrt, log\r\ndef IA(): return list(map(int, inp().split()))\r\ndef FA(): return list(map(float, inp().split()))\r\ndef SA(): return inp().split()\r\n```"}]}}

Complete the given code for the following problem: The Little Elephant loves sortings.\n\nHe has an array *a* consisting of *n* integers. Let's number the array elements from 1 to *n*, then the *i*-th element will be denoted as *a**i*. The Little Elephant can make one move to choose an arbitrary pair of integers *l* and *r* (1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=*r*<=\u2264<=*n*) and increase *a**i* by 1 for all *i* such that *l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*r*.\n\nHelp the Little Elephant find the minimum number of moves he needs to convert array *a* to an arbitrary array sorted in the non-decreasing order. Array *a*, consisting of *n* elements, is sorted in the non-decreasing order if for any *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*n*) *a**i*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=+<=1 holds.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the size of array *a*. The next line contains *n* integers, separated by single spaces \u2014 array *a* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109). The array elements are listed in the line in the order of their index's increasing.. Output specification: In a single line print a single integer \u2014 the answer to the problem.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nNote: In the first sample the array is already sorted in the non-decreasing order, so the answer is 0.\n\nIn the second sample you need to perform two operations: first increase numbers from second to third (after that the array will be: [3, 3, 2]), and second increase only the last element (the array will be: [3, 3, 3]).\n\nIn the third sample you should make at least 6 steps. The possible sequence of the operations is: (2; 3), (2; 3), (2; 3), (3; 3), (3; 3), (3; 3). After that the array converts to [7, 7, 7, 47].Complete the following code: ```python\n# / *\r\n#\r\n#   / \\   |   |      / \\   |  |  |   |\r\n#  / __\\  |   |     / __\\  |--|  |   |\r\n# /     \\ |__ | __ /     \\ |  |  \\__ /\r\n#\r\n#               __           __\r\n```"}]}}

When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.\n\nThe next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.\n\nHelp the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\nInput specification: The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100..
