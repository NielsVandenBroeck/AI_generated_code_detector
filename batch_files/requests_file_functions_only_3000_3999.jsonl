You can find more formal definitions of a tree and a bipartite graph in the notes section below.\n\nDr. Evil gave Mahmoud and Ehab a tree consisting of *n* nodes and asked them to add edges to it in such a way, that the graph is still bipartite. Besides, after adding these edges the graph should be simple (doesn't contain loops or multiple edges). What is the maximum number of edges they can add?\n\nA loop is an edge, which connects a node with itself. Graph doesn't contain multiple edges when for each pair of nodes there is no more than one edge between them. A cycle and a loop aren't the same .\nInput specification: The first line of input contains an integer *n*\u00a0\u2014 the number of nodes in the tree (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105).\n\nThe next *n*<=-<=1 lines contain integers *u* and *v* (1<=\u2264<=*u*,<=*v*<=\u2264<=*n*, *u*<=\u2260<=*v*)\u00a0\u2014 the description of the edges of the tree.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.. Output specification: Output one integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum number of edges that Mahmoud and Ehab can add to the tree while fulfilling the conditions.\nDemo input: ['3\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n', '5\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 4\\n4 5\\n'], Demo output: ['0\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: Tree definition: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory))\n\nBipartite graph definition: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph)\n\nIn the first test case the only edge that can be added in such a way, that graph won't contain loops or multiple edges is (2,\u20093), but adding this edge will make the graph non-bipartite so the answer is 0.\n\nIn the second test case Mahmoud and Ehab can add edges (1,\u20094) and (2,\u20095)."}]}}

However, the rules of word correction are really strange.\n\nVictor thinks that if a word contains two consecutive vowels, then it's kinda weird and it needs to be replaced. So the word corrector works in such a way: as long as there are two consecutive vowels in the word, it deletes the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it.

Write a python script for the following problem: By 2312 there were *n* Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*)..

Write a python script for the following problem: Beroffice text editor has a wide range of features that help working with text. One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.\n\nBeroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.\n\nFor example:\n -  the following words have typos: \"hellno\", \"hackcerrs\" and \"backtothefutttture\"; -  the following words don't have typos: \"helllllooooo\", \"tobeornottobe\" and \"oooooo\". \nWhen Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.\n\nImplement this feature of Beroffice editor. Consider the following letters as the only vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'. All the other letters are consonants in this problem.\nInput specification: The only line contains a non-empty word consisting of small English letters.

Otherwise, print the length of the longest balanced substring.\nDemo input: ['8\\n11010111\\n', '3\\n111\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: In the first example you can choose the substring [3,\u20096]. It is balanced, and its length is 4. Choosing the substring [2,\u20095] is also possible.\n\nIn the second example it's impossible to find a non-empty balanced substring."}]}}

The tunnel is a rectangular field consisting of three rows and *n* columns. At the beginning of the game the hero is in some cell of the leftmost column. Some number of trains rides towards the hero. Each train consists of two or more neighbouring cells in some row of the field.\n\nAll trains are moving from right to left at a speed of two cells per second, and the hero runs from left to right at the speed of one cell per second. For simplicity, the game is implemented so that the hero and the trains move in turns. First, the hero moves one cell to the right, then one square up or down, or stays idle. Then all the trains move twice simultaneously one cell to the left. Thus, in one move, Philip definitely makes a move to the right and can move up or down. If at any point, Philip is in the same cell with a train, he loses. If the train reaches the left column, it continues to move as before, leaving the tunnel.\n\nYour task is to answer the question whether there is a sequence of movements of Philip, such that he would be able to get to the rightmost column.\nInput specification: Each test contains from one to ten sets of the input data. The first line of the test contains a single integer *t* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=10 for pretests and tests or *t*<==<=1 for hacks; see the Notes section for details) \u2014 the number of sets.\n\nThen follows the description of *t* sets of the input data. \n\nThe first line of the description of each set contains two integers *n*,<=*k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100,<=1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=26) \u2014 the number of columns on the field and the number of trains.

Each of the *k* trains is marked by some sequence of identical uppercase letters of the English alphabet, located in one line. Distinct trains are represented by distinct letters. Character '.' represents an empty cell, that is, the cell that doesn't contain either Philip or the trains.. Output specification: For each set of the input data print on a single line word YES, if it is possible to win the game and word NO otherwise.\nDemo input: ['2\\n16 4\\n...AAAAA........\\ns.BBB......CCCCC\\n........DDDDD...\\n16 4\\n...AAAAA........\\ns.BBB....CCCCC..\\n.......DDDDD....\\n', '2\\n10 4\\ns.ZZ......\\n.....AAABB\\n.YYYYYY...\\n10 4\\ns.ZZ......\\n....AAAABB\\n.YYYYYY...\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\nNO\\n', 'YES\\nNO\\n']\nNote: In the first set of the input of the first sample Philip must first go forward and go down to the third row of the field, then go only forward, then go forward and climb to the second row, go forward again and go up to the first row. After that way no train blocks Philip's path, so he can go straight to the end of the tunnel.\n\nNote that in this problem the challenges are restricted to tests that contain only one testset."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the elements of array. \n\nThe third line contains integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs.

He had been measuring the temperature for the last *n* days. Thus, he got a sequence of numbers *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n*, where the *i*-th number is the temperature on the *i*-th day.\n\nVasya analyzed the temperature statistics in other cities, and came to the conclusion that the city has no environmental problems, if first the temperature outside is negative for some non-zero number of days, and then the temperature is positive for some non-zero number of days. More formally, there must be a positive integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) such that *t*1<=&lt;<=0,<=*t*2<=&lt;<=0,<=...,<=*t**k*<=&lt;<=0 and *t**k*<=+<=1<=&gt;<=0,<=*t**k*<=+<=2<=&gt;<=0,<=...,<=*t**n*<=&gt;<=0. In particular, the temperature should never be zero. If this condition is not met, Vasya decides that his city has environmental problems, and gets upset.\n\nYou do not want to upset Vasya. Therefore, you want to select multiple values of temperature and modify them to satisfy Vasya's condition. You need to know what the least number of temperature values needs to be changed for that.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of days for which Vasya has been measuring the temperature. \n\nThe second line contains a sequence of *n* integers *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n* (|*t**i*|<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the sequence of temperature values. Numbers *t**i* are separated by single spaces.. Output specification: Print a single integer \u2014 the answer to the given task.\nDemo input: ['4\\n-1 1 -2 1\\n', '5\\n0 -1 1 2 -5\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: Note to the first sample: there are two ways to change exactly one number so that the sequence met Vasya's condition. You can either replace the first number 1 by any negative number or replace the number -2 by any positive number."}]}}

As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too.

He spends 2 seconds to enter first 2 passwords, then he waits 5 seconds as soon as he made 2 wrong tries. Then he spends 2 more seconds to enter 2 wrong passwords, again waits 5 seconds and, finally, enters the correct password spending 1 more second. In summary in the worst case he is able to be authorized in 15 seconds.\n\nConsider the second sample case. There is no way of entering passwords and get the access to the site blocked. As soon as the required password has length of 2, Vanya enters all passwords of length 1 anyway, spending 2 seconds for that. Then, in the best case, he immediately enters the correct password and the answer for the best case is 3, but in the worst case he enters wrong password of length 2 and only then the right one, spending 4 seconds at all."}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$.. Output specification: Print the only integer \u2014 maximum possible total time when the lamp is lit.\nDemo input: ['3 10\\n4 6 7\\n', '2 12\\n1 10\\n', '2 7\\n3 4\\n'], Demo output: ['8\\n', '9\\n', '6\\n']\nNote: In the first example, one of possible optimal solutions is to insert value $x = 3$ before $a_1$, so program will be $[3, 4, 6, 7]$ and time of lamp being lit equals $(3 - 0) + (6 - 4) + (10 - 7) = 8$. Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$."}]}}

However, Vasilisa the Wise does not know what the box's secret is, since she cannot open it again. She hopes that you will help her one more time with that.\n\nThe box's lock looks as follows: it contains 4 identical deepenings for gems as a 2<=\u00d7<=2 square, and some integer numbers are written at the lock's edge near the deepenings. The example of a lock is given on the picture below.\n\nThe box is accompanied with 9 gems.

He has even invented a new variant of chess, which he named \u00abPawnChess\u00bb.\n\nThis new game is played on a board consisting of 8 rows and 8 columns. At the beginning of every game some black and white pawns are placed on the board. The number of black pawns placed is not necessarily equal to the number of white pawns placed. \n\nLets enumerate rows and columns with integers from 1 to 8. Rows are numbered from top to bottom, while columns are numbered from left to right. Now we denote as (*r*,<=*c*) the cell located at the row *r* and at the column *c*.\n\nThere are always two players A and B playing the game. Player A plays with white pawns, while player B plays with black ones. The goal of player A is to put any of his pawns to the row 1, while player B tries to put any of his pawns to the row 8. As soon as any of the players completes his goal the game finishes immediately and the succeeded player is declared a winner.\n\nPlayer A moves first and then they alternate turns. On his move player A must choose exactly one white pawn and move it one step upward and player B (at his turn) must choose exactly one black pawn and move it one step down. Any move is possible only if the targeted cell is empty. It's guaranteed that for any scenario of the game there will always be at least one move available for any of the players.\n\nMoving upward means that the pawn located in (*r*,<=*c*) will go to the cell (*r*<=-<=1,<=*c*), while moving down means the pawn located in (*r*,<=*c*) will go to the cell (*r*<=+<=1,<=*c*). Again, the corresponding cell must be empty, i.e. not occupied by any other pawn of any color.\n\nGiven the initial disposition of the board, determine who wins the game if both players play optimally. Note that there will always be a winner due to the restriction that for any game scenario both players will have some moves available.\nInput specification: The input consists of the board description given in eight lines, each line contains eight characters. Character 'B' is used to denote a black pawn, and character 'W' represents a white pawn. Empty cell is marked with '.'. \n\nIt's guaranteed that there will not be white pawns on the first row neither black pawns on the last row.. Output specification: Print 'A' if player A wins the game on the given board, and 'B' if player B will claim the victory.

Player B needs at least 5 steps for any of his pawns to reach the row 8. Hence, player A will be the winner."}]}}

He asked a girl sitting next to him to lend him some cheat papers for this questions and found there the following definition:\n\nThe minimum spanning tree *T* of graph *G* is such a tree that it contains all the vertices of the original graph *G*, and the sum of the weights of its edges is the minimum possible among all such trees.\n\nVladislav drew a graph with *n* vertices and *m* edges containing no loops and multiple edges. He found one of its minimum spanning trees and then wrote for each edge its weight and whether it is included in the found tree or not. Unfortunately, the piece of paper where the graph was painted is gone and the teacher is getting very angry and demands to see the original graph. Help Vladislav come up with a graph so that the information about the minimum spanning tree remains correct.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* ()\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph.\n\nEach of the next *m* lines describes an edge of the graph and consists of two integers *a**j* and *b**j* (1<=\u2264<=*a**j*<=\u2264<=109,<=*b**j*<==<={0,<=1}). The first of these numbers is the weight of the edge and the second number is equal to 1 if this edge was included in the minimum spanning tree found by Vladislav, or 0 if it was not.\n\nIt is guaranteed that exactly *n*<=-<=1 number {*b**j*} are equal to one and exactly *m*<=-<=*n*<=+<=1 of them are equal to zero.. Output specification: If Vladislav has made a mistake and such graph doesn't exist, print <=-<=1.\n\nOtherwise print *m* lines. On the *j*-th line print a pair of vertices (*u**j*,<=*v**j*) (1<=\u2264<=*u**j*,<=*v**j*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*u**j*<=\u2260<=*v**j*), that should be connected by the *j*-th edge. The edges are numbered in the same order as in the input. The graph, determined by these edges, must be connected, contain no loops or multiple edges and its edges with *b**j*<==<=1 must define the minimum spanning tree. In case there are multiple possible solutions, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['4 5\\n2 1\\n3 1\\n4 0\\n1 1\\n5 0\\n', '3 3\\n1 0\\n2 1\\n3 1\\n'], Demo output: ['2 4\\n1 4\\n3 4\\n3 1\\n3 2\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

These *k* dots are different: if *i*<=\u2260<=*j* then *d**i* is different from *d**j*. 1.  *k* is at least 4. 1.  All dots belong to the same color. 1.  For all 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*k*<=-<=1: *d**i* and *d**i*<=+<=1 are adjacent. Also, *d**k* and *d*1 should also be adjacent. Cells *x* and *y* are called adjacent if they share an edge. \nDetermine if there exists a cycle on the field.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=50): the number of rows and columns of the board.\n\nThen *n* lines follow, each line contains a string consisting of *m* characters, expressing colors of dots in each line. Each character is an uppercase Latin letter.. Output specification: Output \"Yes\" if there exists a cycle, and \"No\" otherwise.\nDemo input: ['3 4\\nAAAA\\nABCA\\nAAAA\\n', '3 4\\nAAAA\\nABCA\\nAADA\\n', '4 4\\nYYYR\\nBYBY\\nBBBY\\nBBBY\\n', '7 6\\nAAAAAB\\nABBBAB\\nABAAAB\\nABABBB\\nABAAAB\\nABBBAB\\nAAAAAB\\n', '2 13\\nABCDEFGHIJKLM\\nNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n', 'Yes\\n', 'No\\n']\nNote: In first sample test all 'A' form a cycle.\n\nIn second sample there is no such cycle.\n\nThe third sample is displayed on the picture above ('Y' = Yellow, 'B' = Blue, 'R' = Red)."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: As you know, Vova has recently become a new shaman in the city of Ultima Thule. So, he has received the shaman knowledge about the correct bracket sequences. The shamans of Ultima Thule have been using lots of different types of brackets since prehistoric times. A bracket type is a positive integer. The shamans define a correct bracket sequence as follows:\n -  An empty sequence is a correct bracket sequence. -  If {*a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**l*} and {*b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**k*} are correct bracket sequences, then sequence {*a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**l*,<=*b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**k*} (their concatenation) also is a correct bracket sequence. -  If {*a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**l*} \u2014 is a correct bracket sequence, then sequence  also is a correct bracket sequence, where *v* (*v*<=&gt;<=0) is an integer. \nFor example, sequences {1,<=1,<=<=-<=1,<=2,<=<=-<=2,<=<=-<=1} and {3,<=<=-<=3} are correct bracket sequences, and {2,<=<=-<=3} is not.\n\nMoreover, after Vova became a shaman, he learned the most important correct bracket sequence {*x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n*}, consisting of *n* integers. As sequence *x* is the most important, Vova decided to encrypt it just in case.\n\nEncrypting consists of two sequences. The first sequence {*p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n*} contains types of brackets, that is, *p**i*<==<=|*x**i*| (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*). The second sequence {*q*1,<=*q*2,<=...,<=*q**t*} contains *t* integers \u2014 some positions (possibly, not all of them), which had negative numbers in sequence {*x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n*}.\n\nUnfortunately, Vova forgot the main sequence. But he was lucky enough to keep the encryption: sequences {*p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n*} and {*q*1,<=*q*2,<=...,<=*q**t*}. Help Vova restore sequence *x* by the encryption. If there are multiple sequences that correspond to the encryption, restore any of them. If there are no such sequences, you should tell so.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=106). The second line contains *n* integers: *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=109).\n\nThe third line contains integer *t* (0<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=*n*), followed by *t* distinct integers *q*1,<=*q*2,<=...,<=*q**t* (1<=\u2264<=*q**i*<=\u2264<=*n*).\n\nThe numbers in each line are separated by spaces.. Output specification: Print a single string \"NO\" (without the quotes) if Vova is mistaken and a suitable sequence {*x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n*} doesn't exist.\n\nOtherwise, in the first line print \"YES\" (without the quotes) and in the second line print *n* integers *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n* (|*x**i*|<==<=*p**i*;\u00a0*x**q**j*<=&lt;<=0).

The number *k* has long been known in the Berland army so General Touristov has once again asked Corporal Vasya to perform a simple task: to decipher the flatlanders' message.\n\nHelp Vasya, given an array of integers *a* and number *k*, find the number of subarrays of the array of numbers *a*, which has at least *k* equal numbers.\n\nSubarray *a*[*i*... *j*]\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*j*<=\u2264<=*n*) of array *a*<==<=(*a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*) is an array, made from its consecutive elements, starting from the *i*-th one and ending with the *j*-th one: *a*[*i*... *j*]<==<=(*a**i*,<=*a**i*<=+<=1,<=...,<=*a**j*).\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=4\u00b7105), showing how many numbers an array has and how many equal numbers the subarrays are required to have, correspondingly. \n\nThe second line contains *n* space-separated integers *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 elements of the array.. Output specification: Print the single number \u2014 the number of such subarrays of array *a*, that they have at least *k* equal integers.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. In is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nDemo input: ['4 2\\n1 2 1 2\\n', '5 3\\n1 2 1 1 3\\n', '3 1\\n1 1 1\\n'], Demo output: ['3', '2', '6']\nNote: In the first sample are three subarrays, containing at least two equal numbers: (1,2,1), (2,1,2) and (1,2,1,2).\n\nIn the second sample are two subarrays, containing three equal numbers: (1,2,1,1,3) and (1,2,1,1).\n\nIn the third sample any subarray contains at least one 1 number. Overall they are 6: (1), (1), (1), (1,1), (1,1) and (1,1,1)."}]}}

He likes it so much that on the train he falls asleep. \n\nOnce in summer Peter was going by train from city A to city B, and as usual, was sleeping. Then he woke up, started to look through the window and noticed that every railway station has a flag of a particular colour.\n\nThe boy started to memorize the order of the flags' colours that he had seen. But soon he fell asleep again. Unfortunately, he didn't sleep long, he woke up and went on memorizing the colours. Then he fell asleep again, and that time he slept till the end of the journey.\n\nAt the station he told his parents about what he was doing, and wrote two sequences of the colours that he had seen before and after his sleep, respectively.\n\nPeter's parents know that their son likes to fantasize. They give you the list of the flags' colours at the stations that the train passes sequentially on the way from A to B, and ask you to find out if Peter could see those sequences on the way from A to B, or from B to A. Remember, please, that Peter had two periods of wakefulness.\n\nPeter's parents put lowercase Latin letters for colours. The same letter stands for the same colour, different letters \u2014 for different colours.\nInput specification: The input data contains three lines. The first line contains a non-empty string, whose length does not exceed 105, the string consists of lowercase Latin letters \u2014 the flags' colours at the stations on the way from A to B. On the way from B to A the train passes the same stations, but in reverse order. \n\nThe second line contains the sequence, written by Peter during the first period of wakefulness. The third line contains the sequence, written during the second period of wakefulness. Both sequences are non-empty, consist of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of each does not exceed 100 letters. Each of the sequences is written in chronological order..

The new collection is too diverse, and Tanya is too little, so she asks you to help her in this.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000) and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 the number of types of toys that Tanya already has and the number of bourles that her mom is willing to spend on buying new toys.\n\nThe next line contains *n* distinct integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 the types of toys that Tanya already has.. Output specification: In the first line print a single integer *k*\u00a0\u2014 the number of different types of toys that Tanya should choose so that the number of different types of toys in her collection is maximum possible. Of course, the total cost of the selected toys should not exceed *m*.\n\nIn the second line print *k* distinct space-separated integers *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**k* (1<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 the types of toys that Tanya should choose.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, you may print any of them. Values of *t**i* can be printed in any order.\nDemo input: ['3 7\\n1 3 4\\n', '4 14\\n4 6 12 8\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n2 5 \\n', '4\\n7 2 3 1\\n']\nNote: In the first sample mom should buy two toys: one toy of the 2-nd type and one toy of the 5-th type. At any other purchase for 7 bourles (assuming that the toys of types 1, 3 and 4 have already been bought), it is impossible to buy two and more toys."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Reforms continue entering Berland. For example, during yesterday sitting the Berland Parliament approved as much as *n* laws (each law has been assigned a unique number from 1 to *n*). Today all these laws were put on the table of the President of Berland, G.W. Boosch, to be signed.\n\nThis time mr. Boosch plans to sign 2*k* laws. He decided to choose exactly two non-intersecting segments of integers from 1 to *n* of length *k* and sign all laws, whose numbers fall into these segments. More formally, mr. Boosch is going to choose two integers *a*, *b* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*k*<=+<=1,<=*b*<=-<=*a*<=\u2265<=*k*) and sign all laws with numbers lying in the segments [*a*;\u00a0*a*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] and [*b*;\u00a0*b*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] (borders are included).\n\nAs mr. Boosch chooses the laws to sign, he of course considers the public opinion. Allberland Public Opinion Study Centre (APOSC) conducted opinion polls among the citizens, processed the results into a report and gave it to the president. The report contains the absurdity value for each law, in the public opinion. As mr. Boosch is a real patriot, he is keen on signing the laws with the maximum total absurdity. Help him.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105, 0<=&lt;<=2*k*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of laws accepted by the parliament and the length of one segment in the law list, correspondingly.

Output specification: Print two integers *a*, *b* \u2014 the beginning of segments that mr. Boosch should choose. That means that the president signs laws with numbers from segments [*a*;\u00a0*a*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] and [*b*;\u00a0*b*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1]. If there are multiple solutions, print the one with the minimum number *a*.

That is, there will not exist an employee who is the superior of his/her own immediate manager.\n\nToday the company is going to arrange a party. This involves dividing all *n* employees into several groups: every employee must belong to exactly one group.

Jon agrees to Sam's proposal and Sam sets off his journey to the Citadel. However becoming a trainee at the Citadel is not a cakewalk and hence the maesters at the Citadel gave Sam a problem to test his eligibility. \n\nInitially Sam has a list with a single element *n*. Then he has to perform certain operations on this list. In each operation Sam must remove any element *x*, such that *x*<=&gt;<=1, from the list and insert at the same position , ,  sequentially. He must continue with these operations until all the elements in the list are either 0 or 1.\n\nNow the masters want the total number of 1s in the range *l* to *r* (1-indexed).

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.

Write a python script for the following problem: In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.\n\nThere are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.\n\nOfficer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:\n -  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$; -  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. \nFor example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\n\nThe structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.\n\nFormally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.\n\nBerland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.\n\nSuppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ \u2014 one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.\n\nLet's look at the following example:\n\nIf officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.\n\nIf officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.\n\nTo answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.\n\nYou should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i &lt; i$), where $p_i$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $i$. The commander has index $1$ and doesn't have any superiors.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query is given as a pair ($u_i, k_i$) ($1 \\le u_i, k_i \\le n$), where $u_i$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $k_i$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence.. Output specification: Print $q$ numbers, where the $i$-th number is the officer at the position $k_i$ in the list which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if it starts spreading from officer $u_i$. Print \"-1\" if the number of officers which receive the command is less than $k_i$.\n\nYou should process queries independently. They do not affect each other.\nDemo input: ['9 6\\n1 1 1 3 5 3 5 7\\n3 1\\n1 5\\n3 4\\n7 3\\n1 8\\n1 9\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n6\\n8\\n-1\\n9\\n4\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.

The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat..

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes. The second line contains integers *x**c* and *y**c* \u2014 the initial square's coordinates (1<=\u2264<=*x**c*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y**c*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nThe third line contains an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the number of vectors. Then follow *k* lines, each of them contains two integers *dx**i* and *dy**i* (|*dx**i*|,<=|*dy**i*|<=\u2264<=109,<=|*dx*|<=+<=|*dy*|<=\u2265<=1).. Output specification: Print the single number \u2014 the number of steps Vasya had made.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.\nDemo input: ['4 5\\n1 1\\n3\\n1 1\\n1 1\\n0 -2\\n', '10 10\\n1 2\\n1\\n-1 0\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: In the first sample Vasya is initially positioned at square (1,\u20091) and makes 3 steps by the first vector (1,\u20091). So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091). He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

Flowrisa is a town where there are many strong-scent flowers, and Beetopia is another town where many bees live. In particular, Kuro will avoid any pair of towns $(u, v)$ if on the path from $u$ to $v$, he reaches Beetopia after he reached Flowrisa, since the bees will be attracted with the flower smell on Kuro\u2019s body and sting him.\n\nKuro wants to know how many pair of city $(u, v)$ he can take as his route.

People live in cells. However, it was hard to move between distinct cells, because of the difficulty of escaping the cell. People wanted to meet people who live in other cells.\n\nSo, user tncks0121 has made a transportation system to move between these cells, to celebrate the New Year. First, he thought of *n*<=-<=1 positive integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1.

A bus is a connected graph that is the only path, that is, the graph where all nodes are connected with two other ones except for some two nodes that are the beginning and the end of the path. A ring is a connected graph, where all nodes are connected with two other ones. A star is a connected graph, where a single central node is singled out and connected with all other nodes.

Thus, each CPU can be simultaneously identified as a group of three numbers from the layer number from 1 to *n*, the line number from 1 to *m* and the column number from 1 to *k*.\n\nIn the process of the Super Computer's work the CPUs can send each other messages by the famous turtle scheme: CPU (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*) can send messages to CPUs (*x*<=+<=1,<=*y*,<=*z*), (*x*,<=*y*<=+<=1,<=*z*) and (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*<=+<=1) (of course, if they exist), there is no feedback, that is, CPUs (*x*<=+<=1,<=*y*,<=*z*), (*x*,<=*y*<=+<=1,<=*z*) and (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*<=+<=1) cannot send messages to CPU (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*).\n\nOver time some CPUs broke down and stopped working. Such CPUs cannot send messages, receive messages or serve as intermediates in transmitting messages.

Write a python script for the following problem: *T* is a complete binary tree consisting of *n* vertices. It means that exactly one vertex is a root, and each vertex is either a leaf (and doesn't have children) or an inner node (and has exactly two children). All leaves of a complete binary tree have the same depth (distance from the root). So *n* is a number such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nIn the picture you can see a complete binary tree with *n*<==<=15.\n\nVertices are numbered from 1 to *n* in a special recursive way: we recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the left subtree (if current vertex is not a leaf), then assign a number to the current vertex, and then recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the right subtree (if it exists). In the picture vertices are numbered exactly using this algorithm. It is clear that for each size of a complete binary tree exists exactly one way to give numbers to all vertices. This way of numbering is called symmetric.\n\nYou have to write a program that for given *n* answers *q* queries to the tree.\n\nEach query consists of an integer number *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) and a string *s**i*, where *u**i* is the number of vertex, and *s**i* represents the path starting from this vertex. String *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U', which mean traverse to the left child, to the right child and to the parent, respectively. Characters from *s**i* have to be processed from left to right, considering that *u**i* is the vertex where the path starts.

Jon agrees to Sam's proposal and Sam sets off his journey to the Citadel. However becoming a trainee at the Citadel is not a cakewalk and hence the maesters at the Citadel gave Sam a problem to test his eligibility. \n\nInitially Sam has a list with a single element *n*.

Formally: we number all the planets from $1$ to $n$. $1$ is Earth, $n$ is Mars. Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt.

Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons.-  During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining.-  While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. There will be $14$ tons of rocket with fuel after that.-  During landing on Earth, one ton of fuel can land $7$ tons of cargo, so for landing $14$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel.

Write a python script for the following problem: Imagine that you have a twin brother or sister. Having another person that looks exactly like you seems very unusual. It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.\n\nNow let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins.

If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too. You can pick coins with values 1,\u20092 or 2,\u20092. In any case, the minimum number of coins equals 2."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Polycarp starts his own business. Tomorrow will be the first working day of his car repair shop. For now the car repair shop is very small and only one car can be repaired at a given time.\n\nPolycarp is good at marketing, so he has already collected *n* requests from clients. The requests are numbered from 1 to *n* in order they came.\n\nThe *i*-th request is characterized by two values: *s**i* \u2014 the day when a client wants to start the repair of his car, *d**i* \u2014 duration (in days) to repair the car. The days are enumerated from 1, the first day is tomorrow, the second day is the day after tomorrow and so on.\n\nPolycarp is making schedule by processing requests in the order from the first to the *n*-th request. He schedules the *i*-th request as follows:\n -  If the car repair shop is idle for *d**i* days starting from *s**i* (*s**i*,<=*s**i*<=+<=1,<=...,<=*s**i*<=+<=*d**i*<=-<=1), then these days are used to repair a car of the *i*-th client. -  Otherwise, Polycarp finds the first day *x* (from 1 and further) that there are *d**i* subsequent days when no repair is scheduled starting from *x*. In other words he chooses the smallest positive *x* that all days *x*,<=*x*<=+<=1,<=...,<=*x*<=+<=*d**i*<=-<=1 are not scheduled for repair of any car. So, the car of the *i*-th client will be repaired in the range [*x*,<=*x*<=+<=*d**i*<=-<=1]. It is possible that the day *x* when repair is scheduled to start will be less than *s**i*. \nGiven *n* requests, you are asked to help Polycarp schedule all of them according to the rules above.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200) \u2014 the number of requests from clients.\n\nThe following *n* lines contain requests, one request per line. The *i*-th request is given as the pair of integers *s**i*,<=*d**i* (1<=\u2264<=*s**i*<=\u2264<=109, 1<=\u2264<=*d**i*<=\u2264<=5\u00b7106), where *s**i* is the preferred time to start repairing the *i*-th car, *d**i* is the number of days to repair the *i*-th car.\n\nThe requests should be processed in the order they are given in the input.. Output specification: Print *n* lines. The *i*-th line should contain two integers \u2014 the start day to repair the *i*-th car and the finish day to repair the *i*-th car.\nDemo input: ['3\\n9 2\\n7 3\\n2 4\\n', '4\\n1000000000 1000000\\n1000000000 1000000\\n100000000 1000000\\n1000000000 1000000\\n'], Demo output: ['9 10\\n1 3\\n4 7\\n', '1000000000 1000999999\\n1 1000000\\n100000000 100999999\\n1000001 2000000\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Today Sonya learned about long integers and invited all her friends to share the fun. Sonya has an initially empty multiset with integers. Friends give her *t* queries, each of one of the following type:\n 1.  <=+<= *a**i*\u00a0\u2014 add non-negative integer *a**i* to the multiset. Note, that she has a multiset, thus there may be many occurrences of the same integer. 1.  <=-<= *a**i*\u00a0\u2014 delete a single occurrence of non-negative integer *a**i* from the multiset. It's guaranteed, that there is at least one *a**i* in the multiset. 1.  ? *s*\u00a0\u2014 count the number of integers in the multiset (with repetitions) that match some pattern *s* consisting of 0 and 1. In the pattern, 0 stands for the even digits, while 1 stands for the odd. Integer *x* matches the pattern *s*, if the parity of the *i*-th from the right digit in decimal notation matches the *i*-th from the right digit of the pattern. If the pattern is shorter than this integer, it's supplemented with 0-s from the left. Similarly, if the integer is shorter than the pattern its decimal notation is supplemented with the 0-s from the left. \nFor example, if the pattern is *s*<==<=010, than integers 92, 2212, 50 and 414 match the pattern, while integers 3, 110, 25 and 1030 do not.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains an integer *t* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of operation Sonya has to perform.\n\nNext *t* lines provide the descriptions of the queries in order they appear in the input file.

If *c**i* equals '?' then it's followed by a space and a sequence of zeroes and onse, giving the pattern of length no more than 18.\n\nIt's guaranteed that there will be at least one query of type '?'.\n\nIt's guaranteed that any time some integer is removed from the multiset, there will be at least one occurrence of this integer in it.. Output specification: For each query of the third type print the number of integers matching the given pattern. Each integer is counted as many times, as it appears in the multiset at this moment of time.\nDemo input: ['12\\n+ 1\\n+ 241\\n? 1\\n+ 361\\n- 241\\n? 0101\\n+ 101\\n? 101\\n- 101\\n? 101\\n+ 4000\\n? 0\\n', '4\\n+ 200\\n+ 200\\n- 200\\n? 0\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n1\\n2\\n1\\n1\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: Consider the integers matching the patterns from the queries of the third type.

Write a python script for the following problem: Imagine that you have a twin brother or sister. Having another person that looks exactly like you seems very unusual. It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.\n\nNow let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins.

If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too. You can pick coins with values 1,\u20092 or 2,\u20092. In any case, the minimum number of coins equals 2."}]}}

For following moves, there are some restrictions: if during last move the opposite player put his chip to cell with coordinates (*x**l*,<=*y**l*) in some small field, the next move should be done in one of the cells of the small field with coordinates (*x**l*,<=*y**l*). For example, if in the first move a player puts his chip to lower left cell of central field, then the second player on his next move should put his chip into some cell of lower left field (pay attention to the first test case). If there are no free cells in the required field, the player can put his chip to any empty cell on any field.\n\nYou are given current state of the game and coordinates of cell in which the last move was done.

A photographic rifle is obviously for Sharic who loves hunting and fish is for Matroskin, but for whom was a new video game console meant? Every one of the three friends claimed that the present is for him and nearly quarreled. Uncle Fyodor had an idea how to solve the problem justly: they should suppose that the console was sent to all three of them and play it in turns. Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up \u2014 who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that\u2019s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player wins.

Write a python script for the following problem: Grisha come to a contest and faced the following problem.\n\nYou are given an array of size $n$, initially consisting of zeros. The elements of the array are enumerated from $1$ to $n$. You perform $q$ operations on the array. The $i$-th operation is described with three integers $l_i$, $r_i$ and $x_i$ ($1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$, $1 \\leq x_i \\leq n$) and means that you should add $x_i$ to each of the elements with indices $l_i, l_i + 1, \\ldots, r_i$. After all operations you should find the maximum in the array.\n\nGrisha is clever, so he solved the problem quickly.\n\nHowever something went wrong inside his head and now he thinks of the following question: \"consider we applied some subset of the operations to the array. What are the possible values of the maximum in the array?\"\n\nHelp Grisha, find all integers $y$ between $1$ and $n$ such that if you apply some subset (possibly empty) of the operations, then the maximum in the array becomes equal to $y$.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \\leq n, q \\leq 10^{4}$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array and the number of queries in the initial problem.\n\nThe following $q$ lines contain queries, one per line. The $i$-th of these lines contains three integers $l_i$, $r_i$ and $x_i$ ($1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$, $1 \\leq x_i \\leq n$), denoting a query of adding $x_i$ to the segment from $l_i$-th to $r_i$-th elements of the array, inclusive.. Output specification: In the first line print the only integer $k$, denoting the number of integers from $1$ to $n$, inclusive, that can be equal to the maximum in the array after applying some subset (possibly empty) of the given operations.\n\nIn the next line print these $k$ integers from $1$ to $n$\u00a0\u2014 the possible values of the maximum. Print these integers in increasing order.\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n1 3 1\\n2 4 2\\n3 4 4\\n', '7 2\\n1 5 1\\n3 7 2\\n', '10 3\\n1 1 2\\n1 1 3\\n1 1 6\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n1 2 3 4 \\n', '3\\n1 2 3 \\n', '6\\n2 3 5 6 8 9 \\n']\nNote: Consider the first example. If you consider the subset only of the first query, the maximum is equal to $1$. If you take only the second query, the maximum equals to $2$. If you take the first two queries, the maximum becomes $3$. If you take only the fourth query, the maximum becomes $4$. If you take the fourth query and something more, the maximum becomes greater that $n$, so you shouldn't print it.\n\nIn the second example you can take the first query to obtain $1$. You can take only the second query to obtain $2$. You can take all queries to obtain $3$.\n\nIn the third example you can obtain the following maximums:\n -  You can achieve the maximim of $2$ by using queries: $(1)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $3$ by using queries: $(2)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $5$ by using queries: $(1, 2)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $6$ by using queries: $(3)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $8$ by using queries: $(1, 3)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $9$ by using queries: $(2, 3)$."}]}}

Independent researchers confirmed that the nervous system of a zombie is highly complicated \u2013 it consists of *n* brains (much like a cow has several stomachs). They are interconnected by brain connectors, which are veins capable of transmitting thoughts between brains. There are two important properties such a brain network should have to function properly: \n 1.  It should be possible to exchange thoughts between any two pairs of brains (perhaps indirectly, through other brains). 1.  There should be no redundant brain connectors, that is, removing any brain connector would make property 1 false. \nIf both properties are satisfied, we say that the nervous system is valid.

Each pair represents coordinates of one vertex of the square. Coordinates within each line are either in clockwise or counterclockwise order.\n\nThe first line contains the coordinates of the square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the second line contains the coordinates of the square at 45 degrees.\n\nAll the values are integer and between $-100$ and $100$.. Output specification: Print \"Yes\" if squares intersect, otherwise print \"No\".\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\nDemo input: ['0 0 6 0 6 6 0 6\\n1 3 3 5 5 3 3 1\\n', '0 0 6 0 6 6 0 6\\n7 3 9 5 11 3 9 1\\n', '6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0\\n7 4 4 7 7 10 10 7\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n', 'YES\\n']\nNote: In the first example the second square lies entirely within the first square, so they do intersect.\n\nIn the second sample squares do not have any points in common.\n\nHere are images corresponding to the samples:"}]}}

He spends 2 seconds to enter first 2 passwords, then he waits 5 seconds as soon as he made 2 wrong tries. Then he spends 2 more seconds to enter 2 wrong passwords, again waits 5 seconds and, finally, enters the correct password spending 1 more second. In summary in the worst case he is able to be authorized in 15 seconds.\n\nConsider the second sample case. There is no way of entering passwords and get the access to the site blocked. As soon as the required password has length of 2, Vanya enters all passwords of length 1 anyway, spending 2 seconds for that.

The three problems require 5, 10 and 15 minutes respectively. Limak can spend 5\u2009+\u200910\u2009=\u200915 minutes to solve first two problems. Then, at 20:15 he can leave his house to get to the party at 23:57 (after 222 minutes). In this scenario Limak would solve 2 problems. He doesn't have enough time to solve 3 problems so the answer is 2.\n\nIn the second sample, Limak can solve all 4 problems in 5\u2009+\u200910\u2009+\u200915\u2009+\u200920\u2009=\u200950 minutes. At 20:50 he will leave the house and go to the party. He will get there exactly at midnight.\n\nIn the third sample, Limak needs only 1 minute to get to the party. He has enough time to solve all 7 problems."}]}}

But Jack knows on what planet will Apophis land. In order to save his friends, Jack must repeatedly go through stargates to get to this planet.\n\nOverall the galaxy has *n* planets, indexed with numbers from 1 to *n*. Jack is on the planet with index 1, and Apophis will land on the planet with index *n*. Jack can move between some pairs of planets through stargates (he can move in both directions); the transfer takes a positive, and, perhaps, for different pairs of planets unequal number of seconds. Jack begins his journey at time 0.\n\nIt can be that other travellers are arriving to the planet where Jack is currently located. In this case, Jack has to wait for exactly 1 second before he can use the stargate. That is, if at time *t* another traveller arrives to the planet, Jack can only pass through the stargate at time *t*<=+<=1, unless there are more travellers arriving at time *t*<=+<=1 to the same planet.\n\nKnowing the information about travel times between the planets, and the times when Jack would not be able to use the stargate on particular planets, determine the minimum time in which he can get to the planet with index *n*.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers: *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105), the number of planets in the galaxy, and *m* (0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of pairs of planets between which Jack can travel using stargates.

Formally: we number all the planets from $1$ to $n$. $1$ is Earth, $n$ is Mars. Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt.

Output specification: If Natasha can fly to Mars through $(n - 2)$ planets and return to Earth, print the minimum mass of fuel (in tons) that Natasha should take. Otherwise, print a single number $-1$.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel.\n\nThe answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $10^{-6}$. Formally, let your answer be $p$, and the jury's answer be $q$. Your answer is considered correct if $\\frac{|p - q|}{\\max{(1, |q|)}} \\le 10^{-6}$.\nDemo input: ['2\\n12\\n11 8\\n7 5\\n', '3\\n1\\n1 4 1\\n2 5 3\\n', '6\\n2\\n4 6 3 3 5 6\\n2 6 3 6 5 3\\n'], Demo output: ['10.0000000000\\n', '-1\\n', '85.4800000000\\n']\nNote: Let's consider the first example.\n\nInitially, the mass of a rocket with fuel is $22$ tons.\n-  At take-off from Earth one ton of fuel can lift off $11$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $22$ tons you need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons.-  During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining.-  While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. There will be $14$ tons of rocket with fuel after that.-  During landing on Earth, one ton of fuel can land $7$ tons of cargo, so for landing $14$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight is $12$ tons, that is, a rocket without any fuel.\nIn the second case, the rocket will not be able even to take off from Earth."}]}}

Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!).

He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.\n\nOne day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too.

Write a python script for the following problem: Igor has been into chess for a long time and now he is sick of the game by the ordinary rules. He is going to think of new rules of the game and become world famous.\n\nIgor's chessboard is a square of size *n*<=\u00d7<=*n* cells. Igor decided that simple rules guarantee success, that's why his game will have only one type of pieces. Besides, all pieces in his game are of the same color. The possible moves of a piece are described by a set of shift vectors. The next passage contains a formal description of available moves.\n\nLet the rows of the board be numbered from top to bottom and the columns be numbered from left to right from 1 to *n*. Let's assign to each square a pair of integers (*x*,<=*y*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of the corresponding column and row. Each of the possible moves of the piece is defined by a pair of integers (*dx*,<=*dy*); using this move, the piece moves from the field (*x*,<=*y*) to the field (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). You can perform the move if the cell (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*) is within the boundaries of the board and doesn't contain another piece. Pieces that stand on the cells other than (*x*,<=*y*) and (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*) are not important when considering the possibility of making the given move (for example, like when a knight moves in usual chess).\n\nIgor offers you to find out what moves his chess piece can make. He placed several pieces on the board and for each unoccupied square he told you whether it is attacked by any present piece (i.e. whether some of the pieces on the field can move to that cell). Restore a possible set of shift vectors of the piece, or else determine that Igor has made a mistake and such situation is impossible for any set of shift vectors.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50).\n\nThe next *n* lines contain *n* characters each describing the position offered by Igor. The *j*-th character of the *i*-th string can have the following values:\n-  o \u2014 in this case the field (*i*,<=*j*) is occupied by a piece and the field may or may not be attacked by some other piece;-  x \u2014 in this case field (*i*,<=*j*) is attacked by some piece;-  . \u2014 in this case field (*i*,<=*j*) isn't attacked by any piece.\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one piece on the board..

Write a python script for the following problem: Let's define the permutation of length *n* as an array *p*<==<=[*p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n*] consisting of *n* distinct integers from range from 1 to *n*. We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value *p*1, value 2 into the value *p*2 and so on.\n\nKyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a permutation. A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle). The cyclic representation is a representation of *p* as a collection of cycles forming *p*. For example, permutation *p*<==<=[4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] has a cyclic representation that looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are swapped, and 5 remains in place. \n\nPermutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya defines the standard cyclic representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first. Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation of [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] is (421)(5)(63).\n\nNow, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For instance, [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] will become [4,<=2,<=1,<=5,<=6,<=3].\n\nKyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of length *n* that do not change in a list in lexicographic order. Unfortunately, his friend Tamaki Suoh lost this list. Kyoya wishes to reproduce the list and he needs your help. Given the integers *n* and *k*, print the permutation that was *k*-th on Kyoya's list.\nInput specification: The first line will contain two integers *n*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*min*{1018,<=*l*} where *l* is the length of the Kyoya's list).. Output specification: Print *n* space-separated integers, representing the permutation that is the answer for the question.\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n', '10 1\\n'], Demo output: ['1 3 2 4\\n', '1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\\n']\nNote: The standard cycle representation is (1)(32)(4), which after removing parenthesis gives us the original permutation. The first permutation on the list would be [1,\u20092,\u20093,\u20094], while the second permutation would be [1,\u20092,\u20094,\u20093]."}]}}

These developments are encoded and stored in a large safe. The Beaver's teeth are strong enough, so the authorities assured that upon arriving at the place the beaver won't have any problems with opening the safe.\n\nAnd he finishes his aspen sprig and leaves for this important task. Of course, the Beaver arrived at the location without any problems, but alas. He can't open the safe with his strong and big teeth. At this point, the Smart Beaver get a call from the headquarters and learns that opening the safe with the teeth is not necessary, as a reliable source has sent the following information: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. There also is a special hint, which can be used to open the safe.

In one minute joystick either discharges by 2 percent (if not connected to a charger) or charges by 1 percent (if connected to a charger).\n\nGame continues while both joysticks have a positive charge. Hence, if at the beginning of minute some joystick is charged by 1 percent, it has to be connected to a charger, otherwise the game stops. If some joystick completely discharges (its charge turns to 0), the game also stops.\n\nDetermine the maximum number of minutes that game can last. It is prohibited to pause the game, i. e. at each moment both joysticks should be enabled. It is allowed for joystick to be charged by more than 100 percent.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two positive integers *a*1 and *a*2 (1<=\u2264<=*a*1,<=*a*2<=\u2264<=100), the initial charge level of first and second joystick respectively.. Output specification: Output the only integer, the maximum number of minutes that the game can last. Game continues until some joystick is discharged.\nDemo input: ['3 5\\n', '4 4\\n'], Demo output: ['6\\n', '5\\n']\nNote: In the first sample game lasts for 6 minute by using the following algorithm:\n -  at the beginning of the first minute connect first joystick to the charger, by the end of this minute first joystick is at 4%, second is at 3%; -  continue the game without changing charger, by the end of the second minute the first joystick is at 5%, second is at 1%; -  at the beginning of the third minute connect second joystick to the charger, after this minute the first joystick is at 3%, the second one is at 2%; -  continue the game without changing charger, by the end of the fourth minute first joystick is at 1%, second one is at 3%; -  at the beginning of the fifth minute connect first joystick to the charger, after this minute the first joystick is at 2%, the second one is at 1%; -  at the beginning of the sixth minute connect second joystick to the charger, after this minute the first joystick is at 0%, the second one is at 2%. \nAfter that the first joystick is completely discharged and the game is stopped."}]}}

Drazil's home is located in point (0,<=0) and Varda's home is located in point (*a*,<=*b*). In each step, he can move in a unit distance in horizontal or vertical direction.

A palindromic number is another matter. It is aesthetically pleasing, and it has a number of remarkable properties. Help Rikhail to convince the scientific community in this!\n\nLet us remind you that a number is called prime if it is integer larger than one, and is not divisible by any positive integer other than itself and one.\n\nRikhail calls a number a palindromic if it is integer, positive, and its decimal representation without leading zeros is a palindrome, i.e. reads the same from left to right and right to left.\n\nOne problem with prime numbers is that there are too many of them. Let's introduce the following notation: \u03c0(*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of primes no larger than *n*, *rub*(*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of palindromic numbers no larger than *n*. Rikhail wants to prove that there are a lot more primes than palindromic ones.\n\nHe asked you to solve the following problem: for a given value of the coefficient *A* find the maximum *n*, such that \u03c0(*n*)<=\u2264<=*A*\u00b7*rub*(*n*).\nInput specification: The input consists of two positive integers *p*, *q*, the numerator and denominator of the fraction that is the value of *A*\u00a0(,\u00a0)..

Even more, it seemed so boring that he fell asleep in the middle of a lesson. And only a loud ringing of a school bell could interrupt his sweet dream. \n\nOf course, the valuable material and the teacher's explanations were lost. However, Valera will one way or another have to do the homework. As he does not know the new material absolutely, he cannot do the job himself. That's why he asked you to help. You're his best friend after all, you just cannot refuse to help. \n\nValera's home task has only one problem, which, though formulated in a very simple way, has not a trivial solution.

In other words, you should count the amount of such numbers from the interval [*a*;*b*], that are not divisible by any number between 2 and *k*<=-<=1 and yet are divisible by *k*.\nInput specification: The first and only line contains three positive integers *a*, *b*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7109,<=2<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7109)..

Crucial moment is just around the corner: Gogol is ready to release it's new tablet Lastus 3000.\n\nThis new device is equipped with specially designed artificial intelligence (AI). Employees of Pineapple did their best to postpone the release of Lastus 3000 as long as possible. Finally, they found out, that the name of the new artificial intelligence is similar to the name of the phone, that Pineapple released 200 years ago. As all rights on its name belong to Pineapple, they stand on changing the name of Gogol's artificial intelligence.\n\nPineapple insists, that the name of their phone occurs in the name of AI as a substring. Because the name of technology was already printed on all devices, the Gogol's director decided to replace some characters in AI name with \"#\". As this operation is pretty expensive, you should find the minimum number of characters to replace with \"#\", such that the name of AI doesn't contain the name of the phone as a substring.\n\nSubstring is a continuous subsequence of a string.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains the name of AI designed by Gogol, its length doesn't exceed 100<=000 characters.

The pupils are called one by one in the alphabetical order, each of them should put a hat on his head and, after some thought, the hat solemnly announces the name of the house the student should enter.\n\nAt that the Hat is believed to base its considerations on the student's personal qualities: it sends the brave and noble ones to Gryffindor, the smart and shrewd ones \u2014 to Ravenclaw, the persistent and honest ones \u2014 to Hufflepuff and the clever and cunning ones \u2014 to Slytherin. However, a first year student Hermione Granger got very concerned about the forthcoming sorting. She studied all the literature on the Sorting Hat and came to the conclusion that it is much simpler than that. If the relatives of the student have already studied at Hogwarts, the hat puts the student to the same house, where his family used to study. In controversial situations, when the relatives studied in different houses or when they were all Muggles like Hermione's parents, then the Hat sorts the student to the house, to which the least number of first years has been sent at that moment. If there are several such houses, the choice is given to the student himself. Then the student can choose any of the houses, to which the least number of first years has been sent so far. \n\nHermione has already asked the students that are on the list before her about their relatives. Now she and her new friends Harry Potter and Ron Weasley want to find out into what house the Hat will put Hermione.\nInput specification: The first input line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=10000). It is the number of students who are in the list before Hermione. The next line contains *n* symbols.

The second disciple is given the choice between the houses where the least number of students has been sent, i.e. Gryffindor, Slytherin and Ravenclaw. If he chooses Gryffindor, Hermione is forced to choose between Ravenclaw and Slytherin, if he chooses Ravenclaw, Hermione will choose between Gryffindor and Slytherin, if he chooses Slytherin, Hermione will choose between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw. In the end, the following situation is possible (it depends on the choice of the second student and Hermione). Hermione will end up 1) in Gryffindor, 2) in Ravenclaw, 3) in Slytherin.

However, he can only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the keys does not exceed *x*. The keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.\n\nVasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest \"Shift\" key is strictly larger than *x*.

Write a python script for the following problem: Mad scientist Mike has just finished constructing a new device to search for extraterrestrial intelligence! He was in such a hurry to launch it for the first time that he plugged in the power wires without giving it a proper glance and started experimenting right away. After a while Mike observed that the wires ended up entangled and now have to be untangled again.\n\nThe device is powered by two wires \"plus\" and \"minus\". The wires run along the floor from the wall (on the left) to the device (on the right). Both the wall and the device have two contacts in them on the same level, into which the wires are plugged in some order. The wires are considered entangled if there are one or more places where one wire runs above the other one. For example, the picture below has four such places (top view):\n\nMike knows the sequence in which the wires run above each other. Mike also noticed that on the left side, the \"plus\" wire is always plugged into the top contact (as seen on the picture). He would like to untangle the wires without unplugging them and without moving the device. Determine if it is possible to do that. A wire can be freely moved and stretched on the floor, but cannot be cut.\n\nTo understand the problem better please read the notes to the test samples.\nInput specification: The single line of the input contains a sequence of characters \"+\" and \"-\" of length *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000).

To untangle the wires, one can first move the \"plus\" wire lower, thus eliminating the two crosses in the middle, and then draw it under the \"minus\" wire, eliminating also the remaining two crosses.\n\nIn the second testcase the \"plus\" wire makes one full revolution around the \"minus\" wire. Thus the wires cannot be untangled: \n\nIn the third testcase the \"plus\" wire simply runs above the \"minus\" wire twice in sequence. The wires can be untangled by lifting \"plus\" and moving it higher: \n\nIn the fourth testcase the \"minus\" wire runs above the \"plus\" wire once.

Then he arranges all his pebbles again (possibly choosing other values of *a* and *b*) and takes back one row, and so on. The game continues until at some point the Beaver ends up with exactly one pebble. \n\nThe game process can be represented as a finite sequence of integers *c*1,<=...,<=*c**k*, where: \n -  *c*1<==<=*n* -  *c**i*<=+<=1 is the number of pebbles that the Beaver ends up with after the *i*-th move, that is, the number of pebbles in a row after some arrangement of *c**i* pebbles (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*k*).

Members *a**i* and *b**i* are friends with each other. No pair of members will appear more than once in the input.. Output specification: If the given network is reasonable, print \"YES\" in a single line (without the quotes). Otherwise, print \"NO\" in a single line (without the quotes).\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n1 3\\n3 4\\n1 4\\n', '4 4\\n3 1\\n2 3\\n3 4\\n1 2\\n', '10 4\\n4 3\\n5 10\\n8 9\\n1 2\\n', '3 2\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n', 'YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: The drawings below show the situation in the first sample (on the left) and in the second sample (on the right). Each edge represents two members that are friends. The answer is \"NO\" in the second sample because members (2,\u20093) are friends and members (3,\u20094) are friends, while members (2,\u20094) are not."}]}}

Crucial moment is just around the corner: Gogol is ready to release it's new tablet Lastus 3000.\n\nThis new device is equipped with specially designed artificial intelligence (AI). Employees of Pineapple did their best to postpone the release of Lastus 3000 as long as possible. Finally, they found out, that the name of the new artificial intelligence is similar to the name of the phone, that Pineapple released 200 years ago. As all rights on its name belong to Pineapple, they stand on changing the name of Gogol's artificial intelligence.\n\nPineapple insists, that the name of their phone occurs in the name of AI as a substring. Because the name of technology was already printed on all devices, the Gogol's director decided to replace some characters in AI name with \"#\".

Then if the girl chooses the third and the fourth subarrays then: \n -  the first flower adds 1\u00b71<==<=1 to the girl's happiness, because he is in one of chosen subarrays, -  the second flower adds (<=-<=2)\u00b71<==<=<=-<=2, because he is in one of chosen subarrays, -  the third flower adds 1\u00b72<==<=2, because he is in two of chosen subarrays, -  the fourth flower adds 3\u00b72<==<=6, because he is in two of chosen subarrays, -  the fifth flower adds (<=-<=4)\u00b70<==<=0, because he is in no chosen subarrays. \nThus, in total 1<=+<=(<=-<=2)<=+<=2<=+<=6<=+<=0<==<=7 is added to the girl's happiness. Alyona wants to choose such subarrays from those suggested by the mother that the value added to her happiness would be as large as possible. Help her do this!\n\nAlyona can choose any number of the subarrays, even 0 or all suggested by her mother.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of flowers and the number of subarrays suggested by the mother.\n\nThe second line contains the flowers moods\u00a0\u2014 *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (<=-<=100<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100).\n\nThe next *m* lines contain the description of the subarrays suggested by the mother. The *i*-th of these lines contain two integers *l**i* and *r**i* (1<=\u2264<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) denoting the subarray *a*[*l**i*],<=*a*[*l**i*<=+<=1],<=...,<=*a*[*r**i*].\n\nEach subarray can encounter more than once.. Output specification: Print single integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum possible value added to the Alyona's happiness.\nDemo input: ['5 4\\n1 -2 1 3 -4\\n1 2\\n4 5\\n3 4\\n1 4\\n', '4 3\\n1 2 3 4\\n1 3\\n2 4\\n1 1\\n', '2 2\\n-1 -2\\n1 1\\n1 2\\n'], Demo output: ['7\\n', '16\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: The first example is the situation described in the statements.\n\nIn the second example Alyona should choose all subarrays.\n\nThe third example has answer 0 because Alyona can choose none of the subarrays."}]}}

The first participant types one character in *v*1 milliseconds and has ping *t*1 milliseconds. The second participant types one character in *v*2 milliseconds and has ping *t*2 milliseconds.\n\nIf connection ping (delay) is *t* milliseconds, the competition passes for a participant as follows: \n 1.  Exactly after *t* milliseconds after the start of the competition the participant receives the text to be entered. 1.  Right after that he starts to type it. 1.  Exactly *t* milliseconds after he ends typing all the text, the site receives information about it. \nThe winner is the participant whose information on the success comes earlier. If the information comes from both participants at the same time, it is considered that there is a draw.\n\nGiven the length of the text and the information about participants, determine the result of the game.\nInput specification: The first line contains five integers *s*, *v*1, *v*2, *t*1, *t*2 (1<=\u2264<=*s*,<=*v*1,<=*v*2,<=*t*1,<=*t*2<=\u2264<=1000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of characters in the text, the time of typing one character for the first participant, the time of typing one character for the the second participant, the ping of the first participant and the ping of the second participant..

Besides, from all acceptable variants Asterix chose the longest one (as Asterix loves long strings). When Asterix read the substring *t* aloud, the temple doors opened. \n\nYou know the string *s*.

Write a python script for the following problem: Vasya used to be an accountant before the war began and he is one of the few who knows how to operate a computer, so he was assigned as the programmer.\n\nWe all know that programs often store sets of integers. For example, if we have a problem about a weighted directed graph, its edge can be represented by three integers: the number of the starting vertex, the number of the final vertex and the edge's weight. So, as Vasya was trying to represent characteristics of a recently invented robot in his program, he faced the following problem.\n\nVasya is not a programmer, so he asked his friend Gena, what the convenient way to store *n* integers is. Gena used to code in language X-- and so he can use only the types that occur in this language. Let's define, what a \"type\" is in language X--:\n -  First, a type is a string \"int\". -  Second, a type is a string that starts with \"pair\", then followed by angle brackets listing exactly two comma-separated other types of language X--. This record contains no spaces. -  No other strings can be regarded as types. \nMore formally: type := int | pair&lt;type,type&gt;. For example, Gena uses the following type for graph edges: pair&lt;int,pair&lt;int,int&gt;&gt;.\n\nGena was pleased to help Vasya, he dictated to Vasya a type of language X--, that stores *n* integers. Unfortunately, Gena was in a hurry, so he omitted the punctuation. Now Gena has already left and Vasya can't find the correct punctuation, resulting in a type of language X--, however hard he tries.\n\nHelp Vasya and add the punctuation marks so as to receive the valid type of language X--. Otherwise say that the task is impossible to perform.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105), showing how many numbers the type dictated by Gena contains.\n\nThe second line contains space-separated words, said by Gena. Each of them is either \"pair\" or \"int\" (without the quotes).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total number of words does not exceed 105 and that among all the words that Gena said, there are exactly *n* words \"int\".. Output specification: If it is possible to add the punctuation marks so as to get a correct type of language X-- as a result, print a single line that represents the resulting type. Otherwise, print \"Error occurred\" (without the quotes). Inside the record of a type should not be any extra spaces and other characters. \n\nIt is guaranteed that if such type exists, then it is unique.\n\nNote that you should print the type dictated by Gena (if such type exists) and not any type that can contain *n* values.\nDemo input: ['3\\npair pair int int int\\n', '1\\npair int\\n'], Demo output: ['pair&lt;pair&lt;int,int&gt;,int&gt;', 'Error occurred']\nNote: none"}]}}

They've got the chess pieces but the board is a problem. They've got an 8<=\u00d7<=8 checkered board, each square is painted either black or white. The Little Elephant and his friend know that a proper chessboard doesn't have any side-adjacent cells with the same color and the upper left cell is white. To play chess, they want to make the board they have a proper chessboard. For that the friends can choose any row of the board and cyclically shift the cells of the chosen row, that is, put the last (rightmost) square on the first place in the row and shift the others one position to the right. You can run the described operation multiple times (or not run it at all).\n\nFor example, if the first line of the board looks like that \"BBBBBBWW\" (the white cells of the line are marked with character \"W\", the black cells are marked with character \"B\"), then after one cyclic shift it will look like that \"WBBBBBBW\".\n\nHelp the Little Elephant and his friend to find out whether they can use any number of the described operations to turn the board they have into a proper chessboard.\nInput specification: The input consists of exactly eight lines. Each line contains exactly eight characters \"W\" or \"B\" without any spaces: the *j*-th character in the *i*-th line stands for the color of the *j*-th cell of the *i*-th row of the elephants' board. Character \"W\" stands for the white color, character \"B\" stands for the black color.\n\nConsider the rows of the board numbered from 1 to 8 from top to bottom, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to 8 from left to right. The given board can initially be a proper chessboard.. Output specification: In a single line print \"YES\" (without the quotes), if we can make the board a proper chessboard and \"NO\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\nDemo input: ['WBWBWBWB\\nBWBWBWBW\\nBWBWBWBW\\nBWBWBWBW\\nWBWBWBWB\\nWBWBWBWB\\nBWBWBWBW\\nWBWBWBWB\\n', 'WBWBWBWB\\nWBWBWBWB\\nBBWBWWWB\\nBWBWBWBW\\nBWBWBWBW\\nBWBWBWWW\\nBWBWBWBW\\nBWBWBWBW\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: In the first sample you should shift the following lines one position to the right: the 3-rd, the 6-th, the 7-th and the 8-th.\n\nIn the second sample there is no way you can achieve the goal."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: A stowaway and a controller play the following game. \n\nThe train is represented by *n* wagons which are numbered with positive integers from 1 to *n* from the head to the tail. The stowaway and the controller are initially in some two different wagons. Every minute the train can be in one of two conditions \u2014 moving or idle. Every minute the players move.\n\nThe controller's move is as follows. The controller has the movement direction \u2014 to the train's head or to its tail. During a move the controller moves to the neighbouring wagon correspondingly to its movement direction. If at the end of his move the controller enters the 1-st or the *n*-th wagon, that he changes the direction of his movement into the other one. In other words, the controller cyclically goes from the train's head to its tail and back again during all the time of a game, shifting during each move by one wagon. Note, that the controller always have exactly one possible move.\n\nThe stowaway's move depends from the state of the train. If the train is moving, then the stowaway can shift to one of neighbouring wagons or he can stay where he is without moving. If the train is at a station and is idle, then the stowaway leaves the train (i.e. he is now not present in any train wagon) and then, if it is not the terminal train station, he enters the train again into any of *n* wagons (not necessarily into the one he's just left and not necessarily into the neighbouring one). If the train is idle for several minutes then each such minute the stowaway leaves the train and enters it back.\n\nLet's determine the order of the players' moves. If at the given minute the train is moving, then first the stowaway moves and then the controller does. If at this minute the train is idle, then first the stowaway leaves the train, then the controller moves and then the stowaway enters the train.\n\nIf at some point in time the stowaway and the controller happen to be in one wagon, then the controller wins: he makes the stowaway pay fine. If after a while the stowaway reaches the terminal train station, then the stowaway wins: he simply leaves the station during his move and never returns there again.\n\nAt any moment of time the players know each other's positions. The players play in the optimal way. Specifically, if the controller wins, then the stowaway plays so as to lose as late as possible. As all the possible moves for the controller are determined uniquely, then he is considered to play optimally always. Determine the winner.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m* and *k*. They represent the number of wagons in the train, the stowaway's and the controller's initial positions correspondingly (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50, 1<=\u2264<=*m*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*, *m*<=\u2260<=*k*).\n\nThe second line contains the direction in which a controller moves. \"to head\" means that the controller moves to the train's head and \"to tail\" means that the controller moves to its tail. It is guaranteed that in the direction in which the controller is moving, there is at least one wagon. Wagon 1 is the head, and wagon *n* is the tail.\n\nThe third line has the length from 1 to 200 and consists of symbols \"0\" and \"1\". The *i*-th symbol contains information about the train's state at the *i*-th minute of time. \"0\" means that in this very minute the train moves and \"1\" means that the train in this very minute stands idle. The last symbol of the third line is always \"1\" \u2014 that's the terminal train station.. Output specification: If the stowaway wins, print \"Stowaway\" without quotes. Otherwise, print \"Controller\" again without quotes, then, separated by a space, print the number of a minute, at which the stowaway will be caught.\nDemo input: ['5 3 2\\nto head\\n0001001\\n', '3 2 1\\nto tail\\n0001\\n'], Demo output: ['Stowaway', 'Controller 2']\nNote: none"}]}}
