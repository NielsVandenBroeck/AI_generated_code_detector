Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Programmer Vasya is studying a new programming language &amp;K*. The &amp;K* language resembles the languages of the C family in its syntax. However, it is more powerful, which is why the rules of the actual C-like languages are unapplicable to it. To fully understand the statement, please read the language's description below carefully and follow it and not the similar rules in real programming languages.\n\nThere is a very powerful system of pointers on &amp;K* \u2014 you can add an asterisk to the right of the existing type *X* \u2014 that will result in new type *X*<=*<=. That is called pointer-definition operation. Also, there is the operation that does the opposite \u2014 to any type of *X*, which is a pointer, you can add an ampersand \u2014 that will result in a type &amp;*X*, to which refers *X*. That is called a dereference operation.\n\nThe &amp;K* language has only two basic data types \u2014 void and errtype. Also, the language has operators typedef and typeof.\n-  The operator \"typedef *A* *B*\" defines a new data type *B*, which is equivalent to *A*. *A* can have asterisks and ampersands, and *B* cannot have them. For example, the operator typedef void** ptptvoid will create a new type ptptvoid, that can be used as void**.-  The operator \"typeof *A*\" returns type of *A*, brought to void, that is, returns the type void**...*, equivalent to it with the necessary number of asterisks (the number can possibly be zero). That is, having defined the ptptvoid type, as shown above, the typeof ptptvoid operator will return void**.\nAn attempt of dereferencing of the void type will lead to an error: to a special data type errtype. For errtype the following equation holds true: errtype*<==<=&amp;errtype<==<=errtype. An attempt to use the data type that hasn't been defined before that will also lead to the errtype.\n\nUsing typedef, we can define one type several times. Of all the definitions only the last one is valid. However, all the types that have been defined earlier using this type do not change.\n\nLet us also note that the dereference operation has the lower priority that the pointer operation, in other words &amp;*T*<=*<= is always equal to *T*.\n\nNote, that the operators are executed consecutively one by one. If we have two operators \"typedef &amp;void a\" and \"typedef a* b\", then at first a becomes errtype, and after that b becomes errtype* = errtype, but not &amp;void* = void (see sample 2).\n\nVasya does not yet fully understand this powerful technology, that's why he asked you to help him. Write a program that analyzes these operators.\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of operators. Then follow *n* lines with operators. Each operator is of one of two types: either \"typedef *A* *B*\", or \"typeof *A*\". In the first case the *B* type differs from void and errtype types, and besides, doesn't have any asterisks and ampersands.\n\nAll the data type names are non-empty lines of no more than 20 lowercase Latin letters. The number of asterisks and ampersands separately in one type in any operator does not exceed 10, however if we bring some types to void with several asterisks, their number may exceed 10.. Output specification: For every typeof operator print on the single line the answer to that operator \u2014 the type that the given operator returned.\nDemo input: ['5\\ntypedef void* ptv\\ntypeof ptv\\ntypedef &amp;&amp;ptv node\\ntypeof node\\ntypeof &amp;ptv\\n', '17\\ntypedef void* b\\ntypedef b* c\\ntypeof b\\ntypeof c\\ntypedef &amp;b b\\ntypeof b\\ntypeof c\\ntypedef &amp;&amp;b* c\\ntypeof c\\ntypedef &amp;b* c\\ntypeof c\\ntypedef &amp;void b\\ntypeof b\\ntypedef b******* c\\ntypeof c\\ntypedef &amp;&amp;b* c\\ntypeof c\\n'], Demo output: ['void*\\nerrtype\\nvoid\\n', 'void*\\nvoid**\\nvoid\\nvoid**\\nerrtype\\nvoid\\nerrtype\\nerrtype\\nerrtype\\n']\nNote: Let's look at the second sample.\n\nAfter the first two queries typedef the b type is equivalent to void*, and \u0441 \u2014 to void**.\n\nThe next query typedef redefines b \u2014 it is now equal to &amp;b = &amp;void* = void. At that, the \u0441 type doesn't change.\n\nAfter that the \u0441 type is defined as &amp;&amp;b* = &amp;&amp;void* = &amp;void = errtype. It doesn't influence the b type, that's why the next typedef defines c as &amp;void* = void.\n\nThen the b type is again redefined as &amp;void = errtype. \n\nPlease note that the c type in the next query is defined exactly as errtype******* = errtype, and not &amp;void******* = void******.

Write a python script for the following problem: Little Alyona is celebrating Happy Birthday! Her mother has an array of *n* flowers. Each flower has some mood, the mood of *i*-th flower is *a**i*. The mood can be positive, zero or negative.\n\nLet's define a subarray as a segment of consecutive flowers. The mother suggested some set of subarrays. Alyona wants to choose several of the subarrays suggested by her mother. After that, each of the flowers will add to the girl's happiness its mood multiplied by the number of chosen subarrays the flower is in.\n\nFor example, consider the case when the mother has 5 flowers, and their moods are equal to 1,<=<=-<=2,<=1,<=3,<=<=-<=4. Suppose the mother suggested subarrays (1,<=<=-<=2), (3,<=<=-<=4), (1,<=3), (1,<=<=-<=2,<=1,<=3). Then if the girl chooses the third and the fourth subarrays then: \n -  the first flower adds 1\u00b71<==<=1 to the girl's happiness, because he is in one of chosen subarrays, -  the second flower adds (<=-<=2)\u00b71<==<=<=-<=2, because he is in one of chosen subarrays, -  the third flower adds 1\u00b72<==<=2, because he is in two of chosen subarrays, -  the fourth flower adds 3\u00b72<==<=6, because he is in two of chosen subarrays, -  the fifth flower adds (<=-<=4)\u00b70<==<=0, because he is in no chosen subarrays. \nThus, in total 1<=+<=(<=-<=2)<=+<=2<=+<=6<=+<=0<==<=7 is added to the girl's happiness. Alyona wants to choose such subarrays from those suggested by the mother that the value added to her happiness would be as large as possible.

Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\n\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.. Output specification: Print the name of the winner (\"Kuro\", \"Shiro\" or \"Katie\"). If there are at least two cats that share the maximum beauty, print \"Draw\".\nDemo input: ['3\\nKuroo\\nShiro\\nKatie\\n', '7\\ntreasurehunt\\nthreefriends\\nhiCodeforces\\n', '1\\nabcabc\\ncbabac\\nababca\\n', '15\\nfoPaErcvJ\\nmZaxowpbt\\nmkuOlaHRE\\n'], Demo output: ['Kuro\\n', 'Shiro\\n', 'Katie\\n', 'Draw\\n']\nNote: In the first example, after $3$ turns, Kuro can change his ribbon into ooooo, which has the beauty of $5$, while reaching such beauty for Shiro and Katie is impossible (both Shiro and Katie can reach the beauty of at most $4$, for example by changing Shiro's ribbon into SSiSS and changing Katie's ribbon into Kaaaa). Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice.

The device consists of a wheel with a lowercase English letters written in a circle, static pointer to the current letter and a button that print the chosen letter. At one move it's allowed to rotate the alphabetic wheel one step clockwise or counterclockwise. Initially, static pointer points to letter 'a'. Other letters are located as shown on the picture:\n\nAfter Grigoriy add new item to the base he has to print its name on the plastic tape and attach it to the corresponding exhibit. It's not required to return the wheel to its initial position with pointer on the letter 'a'.\n\nOur hero is afraid that some exhibits may become alive and start to attack him, so he wants to print the names as fast as possible. Help him, for the given string find the minimum number of rotations of the wheel required to print it.\nInput specification: The only line of input contains the name of some exhibit\u00a0\u2014 the non-empty string consisting of no more than 100 characters. It's guaranteed that the string consists of only lowercase English letters.. Output specification: Print one integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of rotations of the wheel, required to print the name given in the input.\nDemo input: ['zeus\\n', 'map\\n', 'ares\\n'], Demo output: ['18\\n', '35\\n', '34\\n']\nNote: To print the string from the first sample it would be optimal to perform the following sequence of rotations: \n 1.  from 'a' to 'z' (1 rotation counterclockwise), 1.  from 'z' to 'e' (5 clockwise rotations), 1.  from 'e' to 'u' (10 rotations counterclockwise), 1.  from 'u' to 's' (2 counterclockwise rotations)."}]}}

Alice immediately took an orange for herself, Bob took an apple. To make the process of sharing the remaining fruit more fun, the friends decided to play a game. They put multiple cards and on each one they wrote a letter, either 'A', or the letter 'B'. Then they began to remove the cards one by one from left to right, every time they removed a card with the letter 'A', Alice gave Bob all the fruits she had at that moment and took out of the bag as many apples and as many oranges as she had before. Thus the number of oranges and apples Alice had, did not change.

Write a python script for the following problem: Vasya is developing his own programming language VPL (Vasya Programming Language). Right now he is busy making the system of exceptions. He thinks that the system of exceptions must function like that.\n\nThe exceptions are processed by try-catch-blocks. There are two operators that work with the blocks:\n1.  The try operator. It opens a new try-catch-block. 1.  The catch(&lt;exception_type&gt;, &lt;message&gt;) operator. It closes the try-catch-block that was started last and haven't yet been closed. This block can be activated only via exception of type &lt;exception_type&gt;. When we activate this block, the screen displays the &lt;message&gt;. If at the given moment there is no open try-catch-block, then we can't use the catch operator.\nThe exceptions can occur in the program in only one case: when we use the throw operator. The throw(&lt;exception_type&gt;) operator creates the exception of the given type.\n\nLet's suggest that as a result of using some throw operator the program created an exception of type *a*. In this case a try-catch-block is activated, such that this block's try operator was described in the program earlier than the used throw operator. Also, this block's catch operator was given an exception type *a* as a parameter and this block's catch operator is described later that the used throw operator. If there are several such try-catch-blocks, then the system activates the block whose catch operator occurs earlier than others. If no try-catch-block was activated, then the screen displays message \"Unhandled Exception\".\n\nTo test the system, Vasya wrote a program that contains only try, catch and throw operators, one line contains no more than one operator, the whole program contains exactly one throw operator.\n\nYour task is: given a program in VPL, determine, what message will be displayed on the screen.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer: *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) the number of lines in the program. Next *n* lines contain the program in language VPL. Each line contains no more than one operator. It means that input file can contain empty lines and lines, consisting only of spaces.\n\nThe program contains only operators try, catch and throw. It is guaranteed that the program is correct. It means that each started try-catch-block was closed, the catch operators aren't used unless there is an open try-catch-block. The program has exactly one throw operator. The program may have spaces at the beginning of a line, at the end of a line, before and after a bracket, a comma or a quote mark.\n\nThe exception type is a nonempty string, that consists only of upper and lower case english letters. The length of the string does not exceed 20 symbols. Message is a nonempty string, that consists only of upper and lower case english letters, digits and spaces. Message is surrounded with quote marks. Quote marks shouldn't be printed. The length of the string does not exceed 20 symbols.\n\nLength of any line in the input file does not exceed 50 symbols..

The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.\n\nCreating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section. At that, the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section. That is, for example, the garden can be represented by a 1<=\u00d7<=5 rectangle, where the section heights are equal to 4, 2, 3, 3, 2.

He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture.

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes. The second line contains integers *x**c* and *y**c* \u2014 the initial square's coordinates (1<=\u2264<=*x**c*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y**c*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nThe third line contains an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the number of vectors. Then follow *k* lines, each of them contains two integers *dx**i* and *dy**i* (|*dx**i*|,<=|*dy**i*|<=\u2264<=109,<=|*dx*|<=+<=|*dy*|<=\u2265<=1).. Output specification: Print the single number \u2014 the number of steps Vasya had made.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++.

So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091). He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: You're a mikemon breeder currently in the middle of your journey to become a mikemon master. Your current obstacle is go through the infamous Biridian Forest.\n\nThe forest\n\nThe Biridian Forest is a two-dimensional grid consisting of *r* rows and *c* columns. Each cell in Biridian Forest may contain a tree, or may be vacant. A vacant cell may be occupied by zero or more mikemon breeders (there may also be breeders other than you in the forest). Mikemon breeders (including you) cannot enter cells with trees. One of the cells is designated as the exit cell.\n\nThe initial grid, including your initial position, the exit cell, and the initial positions of all other breeders, will be given to you. Here's an example of such grid (from the first example):\n\nMoves\n\nBreeders (including you) may move in the forest. In a single move, breeders may perform one of the following actions: \n -  Do nothing. -  Move from the current cell to one of the four adjacent cells (two cells are adjacent if they share a side). Note that breeders cannot enter cells with trees. -  If you are located on the exit cell, you may leave the forest. Only you can perform this move \u2014 all other mikemon breeders will never leave the forest by using this type of movement. \nAfter each time you make a single move, each of the other breeders simultaneously make a single move (the choice of which move to make may be different for each of the breeders).\n\nMikemon battle\n\nIf you and *t* (*t*<=&gt;<=0) mikemon breeders are located on the same cell, exactly *t* mikemon battles will ensue that time (since you will be battling each of those *t* breeders once). After the battle, all of those *t* breeders will leave the forest to heal their respective mikemons.\n\nNote that the moment you leave the forest, no more mikemon battles can ensue, even if another mikemon breeder move to the exit cell immediately after that. Also note that a battle only happens between you and another breeders \u2014 there will be no battle between two other breeders (there may be multiple breeders coexisting in a single cell).\n\nYour goal\n\nYou would like to leave the forest. In order to do so, you have to make a sequence of moves, ending with a move of the final type. Before you make any move, however, you post this sequence on your personal virtual idol Blog. Then, you will follow this sequence of moves faithfully.\n\nGoal of other breeders\n\nBecause you post the sequence in your Blog, the other breeders will all know your exact sequence of moves even before you make your first move. All of them will move in such way that will guarantee a mikemon battle with you, if possible. The breeders that couldn't battle you will do nothing.\n\nYour task\n\nPrint the minimum number of mikemon battles that you must participate in, assuming that you pick the sequence of moves that minimize this number. Note that you are not required to minimize the number of moves you make.\nInput specification: The first line consists of two integers: *r* and *c* (1<=\u2264<=*r*,<=*c*<=\u2264<=1000), denoting the number of rows and the number of columns in Biridian Forest. The next *r* rows will each depict a row of the map, where each character represents the content of a single cell: \n -  'T': A cell occupied by a tree. -  'S': An empty cell, and your starting position. There will be exactly one occurence of this in the map. -  'E': An empty cell, and where the exit is located. There will be exactly one occurence of this in the map. -  A digit (0-9): A cell represented by a digit X means that the cell is empty and is occupied by X breeders (in particular, if X is zero, it means that the cell is not occupied by any breeder). \nIt is guaranteed that it will be possible for you to go from your starting position to the exit cell through a sequence of moves.. Output specification: A single line denoted the minimum possible number of mikemon battles that you have to participate in if you pick a strategy that minimize this number.\nDemo input: ['5 7\\n000E0T3\\nT0TT0T0\\n010T0T0\\n2T0T0T0\\n0T0S000\\n', '1 4\\nSE23\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: The following picture illustrates the first example. The blue line denotes a possible sequence of moves that you should post in your blog:\n\nThe three breeders on the left side of the map will be able to battle you \u2014 the lone breeder can simply stay in his place until you come while the other two breeders can move to where the lone breeder is and stay there until you come. The three breeders on the right does not have a way to battle you, so they will stay in their place.\n\nFor the second example, you should post this sequence in your Blog:\n\nHere's what happens. First, you move one cell to the right.\n\nThen, the two breeders directly to the right of the exit will simultaneously move to the left. The other three breeder cannot battle you so they will do nothing.\n\nYou end up in the same cell with 2 breeders, so 2 mikemon battles are conducted. After those battles, all of your opponents leave the forest.\n\nFinally, you make another move by leaving the forest."}]}}

Then he woke up, started to look through the window and noticed that every railway station has a flag of a particular colour.\n\nThe boy started to memorize the order of the flags' colours that he had seen. But soon he fell asleep again. Unfortunately, he didn't sleep long, he woke up and went on memorizing the colours. Then he fell asleep again, and that time he slept till the end of the journey.\n\nAt the station he told his parents about what he was doing, and wrote two sequences of the colours that he had seen before and after his sleep, respectively.\n\nPeter's parents know that their son likes to fantasize. They give you the list of the flags' colours at the stations that the train passes sequentially on the way from A to B, and ask you to find out if Peter could see those sequences on the way from A to B, or from B to A.

Write a python script for the following problem: Igor has been into chess for a long time and now he is sick of the game by the ordinary rules. He is going to think of new rules of the game and become world famous.\n\nIgor's chessboard is a square of size *n*<=\u00d7<=*n* cells. Igor decided that simple rules guarantee success, that's why his game will have only one type of pieces. Besides, all pieces in his game are of the same color. The possible moves of a piece are described by a set of shift vectors. The next passage contains a formal description of available moves.\n\nLet the rows of the board be numbered from top to bottom and the columns be numbered from left to right from 1 to *n*. Let's assign to each square a pair of integers (*x*,<=*y*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of the corresponding column and row. Each of the possible moves of the piece is defined by a pair of integers (*dx*,<=*dy*); using this move, the piece moves from the field (*x*,<=*y*) to the field (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). You can perform the move if the cell (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*) is within the boundaries of the board and doesn't contain another piece. Pieces that stand on the cells other than (*x*,<=*y*) and (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*) are not important when considering the possibility of making the given move (for example, like when a knight moves in usual chess).\n\nIgor offers you to find out what moves his chess piece can make. He placed several pieces on the board and for each unoccupied square he told you whether it is attacked by any present piece (i.e. whether some of the pieces on the field can move to that cell). Restore a possible set of shift vectors of the piece, or else determine that Igor has made a mistake and such situation is impossible for any set of shift vectors.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50).\n\nThe next *n* lines contain *n* characters each describing the position offered by Igor. The *j*-th character of the *i*-th string can have the following values:\n-  o \u2014 in this case the field (*i*,<=*j*) is occupied by a piece and the field may or may not be attacked by some other piece;-  x \u2014 in this case field (*i*,<=*j*) is attacked by some piece;-  . \u2014 in this case field (*i*,<=*j*) isn't attacked by any piece.\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one piece on the board..

Sometimes they receive parcels from Uncle Fyodor\u2019s parents and sometimes from anonymous benefactors, in which case it is hard to determine to which one of them the package has been sent. A photographic rifle is obviously for Sharic who loves hunting and fish is for Matroskin, but for whom was a new video game console meant? Every one of the three friends claimed that the present is for him and nearly quarreled. Uncle Fyodor had an idea how to solve the problem justly: they should suppose that the console was sent to all three of them and play it in turns. Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up \u2014 who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that\u2019s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player wins. Otherwise, another game round is required.

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, Mike was very busy with studying for exams and contests. Now he is going to chill a bit by doing some sight seeing in the city.\n\nCity consists of *n* intersections numbered from 1 to *n*. Mike starts walking from his house located at the intersection number 1 and goes along some sequence of intersections. Walking from intersection number *i* to intersection *j* requires |*i*<=-<=*j*| units of energy. The total energy spent by Mike to visit a sequence of intersections *p*1<==<=1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**k* is equal to  units of energy.\n\nOf course, walking would be boring if there were no shortcuts. A shortcut is a special path that allows Mike walking from one intersection to another requiring only 1 unit of energy. There are exactly *n* shortcuts in Mike's city, the *i**th* of them allows walking from intersection *i* to intersection *a**i* (*i*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=+<=1) (but not in the opposite direction), thus there is exactly one shortcut starting at each intersection. Formally, if Mike chooses a sequence *p*1<==<=1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**k* then for each 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*k* satisfying *p**i*<=+<=1<==<=*a**p**i* and *a**p**i*<=\u2260<=*p**i* Mike will spend only 1 unit of energy instead of |*p**i*<=-<=*p**i*<=+<=1| walking from the intersection *p**i* to intersection *p**i*<=+<=1. For example, if Mike chooses a sequence *p*1<==<=1,<=*p*2<==<=*a**p*1,<=*p*3<==<=*a**p*2,<=...,<=*p**k*<==<=*a**p**k*<=-<=1, he spends exactly *k*<=-<=1 units of total energy walking around them.\n\nBefore going on his adventure, Mike asks you to find the minimum amount of energy required to reach each of the intersections from his home. Formally, for each 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n* Mike is interested in finding minimum possible total energy of some sequence *p*1<==<=1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**k*<==<=*i*.\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of Mike's city intersection.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (*i*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n* , , describing shortcuts of Mike's city, allowing to walk from intersection *i* to intersection *a**i* using only 1 unit of energy.

For another trip between floors you choose some floor with number *y* (*y*<=\u2260<=*x*) and the lift travels to this floor.

Write a python script for the following problem: Anna and Maria are in charge of the math club for junior students. When the club gathers together, the students behave badly. They've brought lots of shoe laces to the club and got tied with each other. Specifically, each string ties together two students. Besides, if two students are tied, then the lace connects the first student with the second one as well as the second student with the first one.\n\nTo restore order, Anna and Maria do the following. First, for each student Anna finds out what other students he is tied to. If a student is tied to exactly one other student, Anna reprimands him. Then Maria gathers in a single group all the students who have been just reprimanded. She kicks them out from the club. This group of students immediately leaves the club. These students takes with them the laces that used to tie them. Then again for every student Anna finds out how many other students he is tied to and so on. And they do so until Anna can reprimand at least one student.\n\nDetermine how many groups of students will be kicked out of the club.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* \u2014 the initial number of students and laces (). The students are numbered from 1 to *n*, and the laces are numbered from 1 to *m*. Next *m* lines each contain two integers *a* and *b* \u2014 the numbers of students tied by the *i*-th lace (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*a*<=\u2260<=*b*). It is guaranteed that no two students are tied with more than one lace. No lace ties a student to himself..

First Anna and Maria kick out the two students from both ends of the chain (1 and 4), then \u2014 two other students from the chain (2 and 3). At that the students who are running by themselves will stay in the club.\n\nIn the third sample Anna and Maria will momentarily kick out all students except for the fourth one and the process stops at that point. The correct answer is one."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: A famous Berland's painter Kalevitch likes to shock the public. One of his last obsessions is chess. For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards.\n\nAs before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8<=\u00d7<=8 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke.\n\nKalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client's requirements.\n\nIt goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything \u2014 for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's needs. You are asked to help Kalevitch with this task.\nInput specification: The input file contains 8 lines, each of the lines contains 8 characters. The given matrix describes the client's requirements, W character stands for a white square, and B character \u2014 for a square painted black.\n\nIt is guaranteed that client's requirments can be fulfilled with a sequence of allowed strokes (vertical/column or horizontal/row)..

Guests from all over the kingdom gather here to discuss new trends in the world of confectionery. Yet some of the things discussed here are not supposed to be disclosed to the general public: the information can cause discord in the kingdom of Sweetland in case it turns out to reach the wrong hands. So it's a necessity to not let any uninvited guests in.\n\nThere are 26 entrances in Jelly Castle, enumerated with uppercase English letters from A to Z. Because of security measures, each guest is known to be assigned an entrance he should enter the castle through. The door of each entrance is opened right before the first guest's arrival and closed right after the arrival of the last guest that should enter the castle through this entrance. No two guests can enter the castle simultaneously.\n\nFor an entrance to be protected from possible intrusion, a candy guard should be assigned to it. There are *k* such guards in the castle, so if there are more than *k* opened doors, one of them is going to be left unguarded!

And, as the boy loves hockey very much, even more than physics, he forgot to do the homework. Specifically, he forgot to complete his physics tasks. Next day the teacher got very angry at Vasya and decided to teach him a lesson. He gave the lazy student a seemingly easy task: You are given an idle body in space and the forces that affect it. The body can be considered as a material point with coordinates (0; 0; 0). Vasya had only to answer whether it is in equilibrium. \"Piece of cake\" \u2014 thought Vasya, we need only to check if the sum of all vectors is equal to 0. So, Vasya began to solve the problem.

Write a python script for the following problem: Alice has a very important message *M* consisting of some non-negative integers that she wants to keep secret from Eve. Alice knows that the only theoretically secure cipher is one-time pad. Alice generates a random key *K* of the length equal to the message's length. Alice computes the bitwise xor of each element of the message and the key (, where  denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR)) and stores this encrypted message *A*.

For example, each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform and guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well.

People live in cells. However, it was hard to move between distinct cells, because of the difficulty of escaping the cell. People wanted to meet people who live in other cells.\n\nSo, user tncks0121 has made a transportation system to move between these cells, to celebrate the New Year. First, he thought of *n*<=-<=1 positive integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1. For every integer *i* where 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1 the condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* holds. Next, he made *n*<=-<=1 portals, numbered by integers from 1 to *n*<=-<=1. The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) portal connects cell *i* and cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*), and one can travel from cell *i* to cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) using the *i*-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) to cell *i* using the *i*-th portal. It is easy to see that because of condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* one can't leave the Line World using portals.\n\nCurrently, I am standing at cell 1, and I want to go to cell *t*. However, I don't know whether it is possible to go there. Please determine whether I can go to cell *t* by only using the construted transportation system.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3<=\u00d7<=104) and *t* (2<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of cells, and the index of the cell which I want to go to.\n\nThe second line contains *n*<=-<=1 space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1 (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i*). It is guaranteed, that using the given transportation system, one cannot leave the Line World.. Output specification: If I can go to cell *t* using the transportation system, print \"YES\". Otherwise, print \"NO\".\nDemo input: ['8 4\\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1\\n', '8 5\\n1 2 1 2 1 1 1\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, the visited cells are: 1,\u20092,\u20094; so we can successfully visit the cell 4.\n\nIn the second sample, the possible cells to visit are: 1,\u20092,\u20094,\u20096,\u20097,\u20098; so we can't visit the cell 5, which we want to visit."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes. The second line contains integers *x**c* and *y**c* \u2014 the initial square's coordinates (1<=\u2264<=*x**c*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y**c*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nThe third line contains an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the number of vectors. Then follow *k* lines, each of them contains two integers *dx**i* and *dy**i* (|*dx**i*|,<=|*dy**i*|<=\u2264<=109,<=|*dx*|<=+<=|*dy*|<=\u2265<=1).. Output specification: Print the single number \u2014 the number of steps Vasya had made.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++.

So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091). He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

After putting all chessmen, DZY wants that no two chessmen with the same color are on two adjacent cells. Two cells are adjacent if and only if they share a common edge.\n\nYou task is to find any suitable placement of chessmen on the given chessboard.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100).\n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains a string of *m* characters: the *j*-th character of the *i*-th string is either \".\" or \"-\". A \".\" means that the corresponding cell (in the *i*-th row and the *j*-th column) is good, while a \"-\" means it is bad.. Output specification: Output must contain *n* lines, each line must contain a string of *m* characters. The *j*-th character of the *i*-th string should be either \"W\", \"B\" or \"-\".

Write a python script for the following problem: After winning gold and silver in IOI 2014, Akshat and Malvika want to have some fun. Now they are playing a game on a grid made of *n* horizontal and *m* vertical sticks.\n\nAn intersection point is any point on the grid which is formed by the intersection of one horizontal stick and one vertical stick.\n\nIn the grid shown below, *n*<==<=3 and *m*<==<=3. There are *n*<=+<=*m*<==<=6 sticks in total (horizontal sticks are shown in red and vertical sticks are shown in green). There are *n*\u00b7*m*<==<=9 intersection points, numbered from 1 to 9.\n\nThe rules of the game are very simple. The players move in turns. Akshat won gold, so he makes the first move. During his/her move, a player must choose any remaining intersection point and remove from the grid all sticks which pass through this point. A player will lose the game if he/she cannot make a move (i.e. there are no intersection points remaining on the grid at his/her move).\n\nAssume that both players play optimally. Who will win the game?\nInput specification: The first line of input contains two space-separated integers, *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100).. Output specification: Print a single line containing \"Akshat\" or \"Malvika\" (without the quotes), depending on the winner of the game.\nDemo input: ['2 2\\n', '2 3\\n', '3 3\\n'], Demo output: ['Malvika\\n', 'Malvika\\n', 'Akshat\\n']\nNote: Explanation of the first sample:\n\nThe grid has four intersection points, numbered from 1 to 4.\n\nIf Akshat chooses intersection point 1, then he will remove two sticks (1\u2009-\u20092 and 1\u2009-\u20093). The resulting grid will look like this.\n\nNow there is only one remaining intersection point (i.e. 4). Malvika must choose it and remove both remaining sticks. After her move the grid will be empty.\n\nIn the empty grid, Akshat cannot make any move, hence he will lose.\n\nSince all 4 intersection points of the grid are equivalent, Akshat will lose no matter which one he picks."}]}}

Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective. You are able to cope with it not worse, aren't you?\nInput specification: The first and single line contains two integers *A* and *B* (1<=\u2264<=*A*,<=*B*<=\u2264<=109,<=*min*(*A*,<=*B*)<=\u2264<=12)..

Vitya is a clever boy, so he managed to finish all the tasks pretty fast and Oksana Fillipovna gave him a new one, that is much harder.\n\nLet's denote a flip operation of an integer as follows: number is considered in decimal notation and then reverted. If there are any leading zeroes afterwards, they are thrown away. For example, if we flip 123 the result is the integer 321, but flipping 130 we obtain 31, and by flipping 31 we come to 13.\n\nOksana Fillipovna picked some number *a* without leading zeroes, and flipped it to get number *a**r*. Then she summed *a* and *a**r*, and told Vitya the resulting value *n*. His goal is to find any valid *a*.\n\nAs Oksana Fillipovna picked some small integers as *a* and *a**r*, Vitya managed to find the answer pretty fast and became interested in finding some general algorithm to deal with this problem.

Your task is to say if the hidden number is prime or composite.\n\nInteger *x*<=&gt;<=1 is called prime if it has exactly two distinct divisors, 1 and *x*. If integer *x*<=&gt;<=1 is not prime, it's called composite.\n\nYou can ask up to 20 queries about divisors of the hidden number. In each query you should print an integer from interval [2,<=100]. The system will answer \"yes\" if your integer is a divisor of the hidden number. Otherwise, the answer will be \"no\".\n\nFor example, if the hidden number is 14 then the system will answer \"yes\" only if you print 2, 7 or 14.\n\nWhen you are done asking queries, print \"prime\" or \"composite\" and terminate your program.\n\nYou will get the Wrong Answer verdict if you ask more than 20 queries, or if you print an integer not from the range [2,<=100].

Output specification: Up to 20 times you can ask a query\u00a0\u2014 print an integer from interval [2,<=100] in one line. You have to both print the end-of-line character and flush the output. After flushing you should read a response from the input.\n\nIn any moment you can print the answer \"prime\" or \"composite\" (without the quotes). After that, flush the output and terminate your program.\n\nTo flush you can use (just after printing an integer and end-of-line): \n -  fflush(stdout) in C++; -  System.out.flush() in Java; -  stdout.flush() in Python; -  flush(output) in Pascal; -  See the documentation for other languages. \nHacking.

In the interval [2,\u2009100] there is only one number with this divisor. The hidden number must be 59, which is prime.

Upon arrival he immediately began to expand his network of hacked computers. During the week Leha managed to get access to *n* computers throughout the town. Incidentally all the computers, which were hacked by Leha, lie on the same straight line, due to the reason that there is the only one straight street in Vi\u010dkopolis.\n\nLet's denote the coordinate system on this street. Besides let's number all the hacked computers with integers from 1 to *n*. So the *i*-th hacked computer is located at the point *x**i*. Moreover the coordinates of all computers are distinct. \n\nLeha is determined to have a little rest after a hard week. Therefore he is going to invite his friend Noora to a restaurant. However the girl agrees to go on a date with the only one condition: Leha have to solve a simple task.\n\nLeha should calculate a sum of *F*(*a*) for all *a*, where *a* is a non-empty subset of the set, that consists of all hacked computers. Formally, let's denote *A* the set of all integers from 1 to *n*. Noora asks the hacker to find value of the expression . Here *F*(*a*) is calculated as the maximum among the distances between all pairs of computers from the set *a*. Formally, .

Specifically, the square plane contains *n* bombs, the *i*-th bomb is at point with coordinates (*x**i*,<=*y**i*). We know that no two bombs are at the same point and that no bomb is at point with coordinates (0,<=0). Initially, the robot is at point with coordinates (0,<=0). Also, let's mark the robot's current position as (*x*,<=*y*). In order to destroy all the bombs, the robot can perform three types of operations:\n 1.  Operation has format \"1 k dir\". To perform the operation robot have to move in direction *dir* *k* (*k*<=\u2265<=1) times. There are only 4 directions the robot can move in: \"R\", \"L\", \"U\", \"D\". During one move the robot can move from the current point to one of following points: (*x*<=+<=1,<=*y*), (*x*<=-<=1,<=*y*), (*x*,<=*y*<=+<=1), (*x*,<=*y*<=-<=1) (corresponding to directions). It is forbidden to move from point (*x*,<=*y*), if at least one point on the path (besides the destination point) contains a bomb. 1.  Operation has format \"2\". To perform the operation robot have to pick a bomb at point (*x*,<=*y*) and put it in a special container. Thus, the robot can carry the bomb from any point to any other point. The operation cannot be performed if point (*x*,<=*y*) has no bomb. It is forbidden to pick a bomb if the robot already has a bomb in its container. 1.  Operation has format \"3\". To perform the operation robot have to take a bomb out of the container and destroy it. You are allowed to perform this operation only if the robot is at point (0,<=0). It is forbidden to perform the operation if the container has no bomb. \nHelp the robot and find the shortest possible sequence of operations he can perform to destroy all bombs on the coordinate plane.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of bombs on the coordinate plane.

She also has put a robot at each end of the row (to the left of the first number and to the right of the last number). Sonya will give a number to each robot (they can be either same or different) and run them. When a robot is running, it is moving toward to another robot, reading numbers in the row. When a robot is reading a number that is equal to the number that was given to that robot, it will turn off and stay in the same position.\n\nSonya does not want robots to break, so she will give such numbers that robots will stop before they meet. That is, the girl wants them to stop at different positions so that the first robot is to the left of the second one.\n\nFor example, if the numbers $[1, 5, 4, 1, 3]$ are written, and Sonya gives the number $1$ to the first robot and the number $4$ to the second one, the first robot will stop in the $1$-st position while the second one in the $3$-rd position. In that case, robots will not meet each other. As a result, robots will not be broken. But if Sonya gives the number $4$ to the first robot and the number $5$ to the second one, they will meet since the first robot will stop in the $3$-rd position while the second one is in the $2$-nd position.\n\nSonya understands that it does not make sense to give a number that is not written in the row because a robot will not find this number and will meet the other robot.\n\nSonya is now interested in finding the number of different pairs that she can give to robots so that they will not meet. In other words, she wants to know the number of pairs ($p$, $q$), where she will give $p$ to the first robot and $q$ to the second one. Pairs ($p_i$, $q_i$) and ($p_j$, $q_j$) are different if $p_i\\neq p_j$ or $q_i\\neq q_j$.\n\nUnfortunately, Sonya is busy fixing robots that broke after a failed launch.

Unfortunately Max has forgotten the number which he had calculated. The only thing he knows is that the number is divisible by 4.\n\nYou are given a string *s* consisting of digits (the number on the display of the calculator after Yusuf randomly pressed the keys). Your task is to find the number of substrings which are divisible by 4.

Write a python script for the following problem: One foggy Stockholm morning, Karlsson decided to snack on some jam in his friend Lillebror Svantenson's house. Fortunately for Karlsson, there wasn't anybody in his friend's house. Karlsson was not going to be hungry any longer, so he decided to get some food in the house.\n\nKarlsson's gaze immediately fell on *n* wooden cupboards, standing in the kitchen. He immediately realized that these cupboards have hidden jam stocks. Karlsson began to fly greedily around the kitchen, opening and closing the cupboards' doors, grab and empty all the jars of jam that he could find.\n\nAnd now all jars of jam are empty, Karlsson has had enough and does not want to leave traces of his stay, so as not to let down his friend. Each of the cupboards has two doors: the left one and the right one. Karlsson remembers that when he rushed to the kitchen, all the cupboards' left doors were in the same position (open or closed), similarly, all the cupboards' right doors were in the same position (open or closed). Karlsson wants the doors to meet this condition as well by the time the family returns. Karlsson does not remember the position of all the left doors, also, he cannot remember the position of all the right doors.

For example, all the left doors may be closed, and all the right ones may be open.\n\nKarlsson needs one second to open or close a door of a cupboard. He understands that he has very little time before the family returns, so he wants to know the minimum number of seconds *t*, in which he is able to bring all the cupboard doors in the required position.\n\nYour task is to write a program that will determine the required number of seconds *t*.\nInput specification: The first input line contains a single integer *n* \u2014 the number of cupboards in the kitchen (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=104).

Write a python script for the following problem: Imagine that you have a twin brother or sister. Having another person that looks exactly like you seems very unusual. It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.\n\nNow let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins. The second line contains a sequence of *n* integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the coins' values. All numbers are separated with spaces..

If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too. You can pick coins with values 1,\u20092 or 2,\u20092. In any case, the minimum number of coins equals 2."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Attention: we lost all the test cases for this problem, so instead of solving the problem, we need you to generate test cases. We're going to give you the answer, and you need to print a test case that produces the given answer. The original problem is in the following paragraph.\n\nPeople don't use cash as often as they used to. Having a credit card solves some of the hassles of cash, such as having to receive change when you can't form the exact amount of money needed to purchase an item. Typically cashiers will give you as few coins as possible in change, but they don't have to. For example, if your change is 30 cents, a cashier could give you a 5 cent piece and a 25 cent piece, or they could give you three 10 cent pieces, or ten 1 cent pieces, two 5 cent pieces, and one 10 cent piece. Altogether there are 18 different ways to make 30 cents using only 1 cent pieces, 5 cent pieces, 10 cent pieces, and 25 cent pieces. Two ways are considered different if they contain a different number of at least one type of coin. Given the denominations of the coins and an amount of change to be made, how many different ways are there to make change?\n\nAs we mentioned before, we lost all the test cases for this problem, so we're actually going to give you the number of ways, and want you to produce a test case for which the number of ways is the given number. There could be many ways to achieve this (we guarantee there's always at least one), so you can print any, as long as it meets the constraints described below.\nInput specification: Input will consist of a single integer *A* (1<=\u2264<=*A*<=\u2264<=105), the desired number of ways..

Uncle Fyodor had an idea how to solve the problem justly: they should suppose that the console was sent to all three of them and play it in turns. Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up \u2014 who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that\u2019s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player wins.

In our case *A* is between 0 and 9 and *B* is non-negative.\n\nBarney doesn't know anything about scientific notation (as well as anything scientific at all). So he asked you to tell him the distance value in usual decimal representation with minimal number of digits after the decimal point (and no decimal point if it is an integer). See the output format for better understanding.\nInput specification: The first and only line of input contains a single string of form *a*.*deb* where *a*, *d* and *b* are integers and *e* is usual character 'e' (0<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=9,<=0<=\u2264<=*d*<=&lt;<=10100,<=0<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the scientific notation of the desired distance value.\n\n*a* and *b* contain no leading zeros and *d* contains no trailing zeros (but may be equal to 0). Also, *b* can not be non-zero if *a* is zero.. Output specification: Print the only real number *x* (the desired distance value) in the only line in its decimal notation. \n\nThus if *x* is an integer, print it's integer value without decimal part and decimal point and without leading zeroes. \n\nOtherwise print *x* in a form of *p*.*q* such that *p* is an integer that have no leading zeroes (but may be equal to zero), and *q* is an integer that have no trailing zeroes (and may not be equal to zero).\nDemo input: ['8.549e2\\n', '8.549e3\\n', '0.33e0\\n'], Demo output: ['854.9\\n', '8549\\n', '0.33\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

The worst mark is 1, the best is *k*. Mark that is going to the certificate, is calculated as an average of all the marks, rounded to the closest integer. If several answers are possible, rounding up is produced. For example, 7.3 is rounded to 7, but 7.5 and 7.8784\u00a0\u2014 to 8. \n\nFor instance, if Noora has marks [8,<=9], then the mark to the certificate is 9, because the average is equal to 8.5 and rounded to 9, but if the marks are [8,<=8,<=9], Noora will have graduation certificate with 8.\n\nTo graduate with \u00abA\u00bb certificate, Noora has to have mark *k*.\n\nNoora got *n* marks in register this year. However, she is afraid that her marks are not enough to get final mark *k*. Noora decided to ask for help in the internet, where hacker Leha immediately responded to her request. He is ready to hack class register for Noora and to add Noora any number of additional marks from 1 to *k*. At the same time, Leha want his hack be unseen to everyone, so he decided to add as less as possible additional marks. Please help Leha to calculate the minimal number of marks he has to add, so that final Noora's mark will become equal to *k*.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100,<=1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=100) denoting the number of marks, received by Noora and the value of highest possible mark.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*k*) denoting marks received by Noora before Leha's hack.. Output specification: Print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 minimal number of additional marks, that Leha has to add in order to change Noora's final mark to *k*.\nDemo input: ['2 10\\n8 9\\n', '3 5\\n4 4 4\\n'], Demo output: ['4', '3']\nNote: Consider the first example testcase.\n\nMaximal mark is 10, Noora received two marks\u00a0\u2014 8 and 9, so current final mark is 9. To fix it, Leha can add marks [10,\u200910,\u200910,\u200910] (4 marks in total) to the registry, achieving Noora having average mark equal to <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/1b961585522f76271546da990a6228e7c666277f.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>. Consequently, new final mark is 10. Less number of marks won't fix the situation.\n\nIn the second example Leha can add [5,\u20095,\u20095] to the registry, so that making average mark equal to 4.5, which is enough to have 5 in the certificate."}]}}

This time they are located at opposite ends of the corridor of length *l*. Two opponents simultaneously charge a deadly spell in the enemy. We know that the impulse of Harry's magic spell flies at a speed of *p* meters per second, and the impulse of You-Know-Who's magic spell flies at a speed of *q* meters per second.\n\nThe impulses are moving through the corridor toward each other, and at the time of the collision they turn round and fly back to those who cast them without changing their original speeds. Then, as soon as the impulse gets back to it's caster, the wizard reflects it and sends again towards the enemy, without changing the original speed of the impulse.\n\nSince Harry has perfectly mastered the basics of magic, he knows that after the second collision both impulses will disappear, and a powerful explosion will occur exactly in the place of their collision. However, the young wizard isn't good at math, so he asks you to calculate the distance from his position to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses, provided that the opponents do not change positions during the whole fight.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer *l* (1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=1<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the corridor where the fight takes place.\n\nThe second line contains integer *p*, the third line contains integer *q* (1<=\u2264<=*p*,<=*q*<=\u2264<=500)\u00a0\u2014 the speeds of magical impulses for Harry Potter and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, respectively..

At the *i*-th stop *a**i* passengers exit the tram, while *b**i* passengers enter it. The tram is empty before it arrives at the first stop. Also, when the tram arrives at the last stop, all passengers exit so that it becomes empty.\n\nYour task is to calculate the tram's minimum capacity such that the number of people inside the tram at any time never exceeds this capacity. Note that at each stop all exiting passengers exit before any entering passenger enters the tram.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single number *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the number of the tram's stops. \n\nThen *n* lines follow, each contains two integers *a**i* and *b**i* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the number of passengers that exits the tram at the *i*-th stop, and the number of passengers that enter the tram at the *i*-th stop. The stops are given from the first to the last stop in the order of tram's movement.\n -  The number of people who exit at a given stop does not exceed the total number of people in the tram immediately before it arrives at the stop. More formally, . This particularly means that *a*1<==<=0. -  At the last stop, all the passengers exit the tram and it becomes empty. More formally, . -  No passenger will enter the train at the last stop. That is, *b**n*<==<=0.. Output specification: Print a single integer denoting the minimum possible capacity of the tram (0 is allowed).\nDemo input: ['4\\n0 3\\n2 5\\n4 2\\n4 0\\n'], Demo output: ['6\\n']\nNote: For the first example, a capacity of 6 is sufficient: \n -  At the first stop, the number of passengers inside the tram before arriving is 0. Then, 3 passengers enter the tram, and the number of passengers inside the tram becomes 3. -  At the second stop, 2 passengers exit the tram (1 passenger remains inside). Then, 5 passengers enter the tram. There are 6 passengers inside the tram now. -  At the third stop, 4 passengers exit the tram (2 passengers remain inside). Then, 2 passengers enter the tram. There are 4 passengers inside the tram now. -  Finally, all the remaining passengers inside the tram exit the tram at the last stop. There are no passenger inside the tram now, which is in line with the constraints. \nSince the number of passengers inside the tram never exceeds 6, a capacity of 6 is sufficient. Furthermore it is not possible for the tram to have a capacity less than 6. Hence, 6 is the correct answer."}]}}

Having learned the news, the colonel ordered to all *n* squad soldiers to line up on the parade ground.\n\nBy the military charter the soldiers should stand in the order of non-increasing of their height. But as there's virtually no time to do that, the soldiers lined up in the arbitrary order. However, the general is rather short-sighted and he thinks that the soldiers lined up correctly if the first soldier in the line has the maximum height and the last soldier has the minimum height. Please note that the way other solders are positioned does not matter, including the case when there are several soldiers whose height is maximum or minimum. Only the heights of the first and the last soldier are important.\n\nFor example, the general considers the sequence of heights (4, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1) correct and the sequence (4, 3, 1, 2, 2) wrong.\n\nWithin one second the colonel can swap any two neighboring soldiers.

The first character of the slogan must be in the first square (the leftmost) of the poster, the second character must be in the second square, and so on.\n\nOf course, the R1 programmers want to write the slogan on the poster themselves. To do this, they have a large (and a very heavy) ladder which was put exactly opposite the *k*-th square of the poster. To draw the *i*-th character of the slogan on the poster, you need to climb the ladder, standing in front of the *i*-th square of the poster. This action (along with climbing up and down the ladder) takes one hour for a painter. The painter is not allowed to draw characters in the adjacent squares when the ladder is in front of the *i*-th square because the uncomfortable position of the ladder may make the characters untidy. Besides, the programmers can move the ladder. In one hour, they can move the ladder either a meter to the right or a meter to the left.\n\nDrawing characters and moving the ladder is very tiring, so the programmers want to finish the job in as little time as possible.

The ladder can only stand in front of some square of the poster. For example, you cannot shift a ladder by half a meter and position it between two squares.

The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.\nInput specification: There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number. It is guaranteed that the numbers are made from 0 and 1 only and that their length is same. The numbers may start with 0. The length of each number doesn't exceed 100.. Output specification: Write one line \u2014 the corresponding answer. Do not omit the leading 0s.\nDemo input: ['1010100\\n0100101\\n', '000\\n111\\n', '1110\\n1010\\n', '01110\\n01100\\n'], Demo output: ['1110001\\n', '111\\n', '0100\\n', '00010\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

That's why a question arises: \"Which integer type to use if one wants to store a positive integer *n*?\"\n\nPetya knows only 5 integer types:\n\n1) byte occupies 1 byte and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=128 to 127\n\n2) short occupies 2 bytes and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=32768 to 32767\n\n3) int occupies 4 bytes and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=2147483648 to 2147483647\n\n4) long occupies 8 bytes and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807\n\n5) BigInteger can store any integer number, but at that it is not a primitive type, and operations with it are much slower.\n\nFor all the types given above the boundary values are included in the value range.\n\nFrom this list, Petya wants to choose the smallest type that can store a positive integer *n*. Since BigInteger works much slower, Peter regards it last. Help him.\nInput specification: The first line contains a positive number *n*. It consists of no more than 100 digits and doesn't contain any leading zeros. The number *n* can't be represented as an empty string.\n\nPlease, do not use %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use cout (also you may use %I64d).. Output specification: Print the first type from the list \"byte, short, int, long, BigInteger\", that can store the natural number *n*, in accordance with the data given above.\nDemo input: ['127\\n', '130\\n', '123456789101112131415161718192021222324\\n'], Demo output: ['byte\\n', 'short\\n', 'BigInteger\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Your success rate will be equal to 7\u2009/\u200914, or 1\u2009/\u20092.\n\nIn the second example, you have to make 2 successful and 8 unsuccessful submissions. Your success rate will be equal to 9\u2009/\u200924, or 3\u2009/\u20098.\n\nIn the third example, there is no need to make any new submissions. Your success rate is already equal to 20\u2009/\u200970, or 2\u2009/\u20097.\n\nIn the fourth example, the only unsuccessful submission breaks your hopes of having the success rate equal to 1."}]}}

Besides, the keys are of two types. Some of the keys have lowercase Latin letters on them and some of the keys work like the \"Shift\" key on standard keyboards, that is, they make lowercase letters uppercase.\n\nVasya can press one or two keys with one hand. However, he can only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the keys does not exceed *x*. The keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.\n\nVasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest \"Shift\" key is strictly larger than *x*. In this case he will have to use his other hand. Having typed the symbol, Vasya returns other hand back to the chips.\n\nYou are given Vasya's keyboard and the text. Count the minimum number of times Vasya will have to use the other hand.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *x* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=30,<=1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=50).\n\nNext *n* lines contain descriptions of all the keyboard keys. Each line contains the descriptions of exactly *m* keys, without spaces. The letter keys are marked with the corresponding lowercase letters. The \"Shift\" keys are marked with the \"S\" symbol. \n\nThen follow the length of the text *q* (1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=5\u00b7105). The last line contains the text *T*, which consists of *q* symbols, which are uppercase and lowercase Latin letters..

In particular, he needs to automate the hard decision: which main characters will get married by the end of the series.\n\nThere are *n* single men and *n* single women among the main characters. An opinion poll showed that viewers like several couples, and a marriage of any of them will make the audience happy. The Smart Beaver formalized this fact as *k* triples of numbers (*h*,<=*w*,<=*r*), where *h* is the index of the man, *w* is the index of the woman, and *r* is the measure of the audience's delight in case of the marriage of this couple. The same poll showed that the marriage of any other couple will leave the audience indifferent, so the screenwriters decided not to include any such marriages in the plot.\n\nThe script allows you to arrange several marriages between the heroes or not to arrange marriages at all. A subset of some of the *k* marriages is considered acceptable if each man and each woman is involved in at most one marriage of the subset (the series won't allow any divorces). The value of the acceptable set of marriages is the total delight the spectators will get from the marriages included in this set.\n\nObviously, there is a finite number of acceptable sets, and they all describe some variants of the script. The screenwriters do not want to choose a set with maximum value \u2014 it would make the plot too predictable. So the Smart Beaver offers the following option: sort all the acceptable sets in increasing order of value and choose the *t*-th set from the sorted list. Thus, *t*<==<=1 corresponds to a plot without marriages, *t*<==<=2 \u2014 to a single marriage resulting in minimal delight for the audience, and so on.\n\nHelp the Beaver to implement the algorithm for selecting the desired set.\nInput specification: The first input line contains integers *n*, *k* and *t* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*min*(100,<=*n*2), 1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105), separated by single spaces.

If the time needed with the second oven is the same as with one oven, then it is unreasonable.\nInput specification: The only line contains four integers *n*, *t*, *k*, *d* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*t*,<=*k*,<=*d*<=\u2264<=1<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cakes needed, the time needed for one oven to bake *k* cakes, the number of cakes baked at the same time, the time needed to build the second oven.. Output specification: If it is reasonable to build the second oven, print \"YES\". Otherwise print \"NO\".\nDemo input: ['8 6 4 5\\n', '8 6 4 6\\n', '10 3 11 4\\n', '4 2 1 4\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n', 'NO\\n', 'YES\\n']\nNote: In the first example it is possible to get 8 cakes in 12 minutes using one oven. The second oven can be built in 5 minutes, so after 6 minutes the first oven bakes 4 cakes, the second oven bakes 4 more ovens after 11 minutes. Thus, it is reasonable to build the second oven. \n\nIn the second example it doesn't matter whether we build the second oven or not, thus it takes 12 minutes to bake 8 cakes in both cases. Thus, it is unreasonable to build the second oven.\n\nIn the third example the first oven bakes 11 cakes in 3 minutes, that is more than needed 10. It is unreasonable to build the second oven, because its building takes more time that baking the needed number of cakes using the only oven."}]}}

Recently, he has decided to take a couple of old songs and make dubstep remixes from them.\n\nLet's assume that a song consists of some number of words. To make the dubstep remix of this song, Vasya inserts a certain number of words \"WUB\" before the first word of the song (the number may be zero), after the last word (the number may be zero), and between words (at least one between any pair of neighbouring words), and then the boy glues together all the words, including \"WUB\", in one string and plays the song at the club.\n\nFor example, a song with words \"I AM X\" can transform into a dubstep remix as \"WUBWUBIWUBAMWUBWUBX\" and cannot transform into \"WUBWUBIAMWUBX\".\n\nRecently, Petya has heard Vasya's new dubstep track, but since he isn't into modern music, he decided to find out what was the initial song that Vasya remixed.

He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of dogs.\nDemo input: ['6 6\\n..S...\\n..S.W.\\n.S....\\n..W...\\n...W..\\n......\\n', '1 2\\nSW\\n', '5 5\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS....\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n..SD..\\n..SDW.\\n.SD...\\n.DW...\\nDD.W..\\n......\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS.D..\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n']\nNote: In the first example, we can split the pasture into two halves, one containing wolves and one containing sheep. Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Let's define the permutation of length *n* as an array *p*<==<=[*p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n*] consisting of *n* distinct integers from range from 1 to *n*. We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value *p*1, value 2 into the value *p*2 and so on.\n\nKyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a permutation. A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle). The cyclic representation is a representation of *p* as a collection of cycles forming *p*. For example, permutation *p*<==<=[4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] has a cyclic representation that looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are swapped, and 5 remains in place. \n\nPermutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya defines the standard cyclic representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first. Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation of [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] is (421)(5)(63).\n\nNow, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For instance, [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] will become [4,<=2,<=1,<=5,<=6,<=3].\n\nKyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of length *n* that do not change in a list in lexicographic order. Unfortunately, his friend Tamaki Suoh lost this list. Kyoya wishes to reproduce the list and he needs your help. Given the integers *n* and *k*, print the permutation that was *k*-th on Kyoya's list.\nInput specification: The first line will contain two integers *n*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*min*{1018,<=*l*} where *l* is the length of the Kyoya's list).. Output specification: Print *n* space-separated integers, representing the permutation that is the answer for the question.\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n', '10 1\\n'], Demo output: ['1 3 2 4\\n', '1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\\n']\nNote: The standard cycle representation is (1)(32)(4), which after removing parenthesis gives us the original permutation. The first permutation on the list would be [1,\u20092,\u20093,\u20094], while the second permutation would be [1,\u20092,\u20094,\u20093]."}]}}

Flowrisa is a town where there are many strong-scent flowers, and Beetopia is another town where many bees live.

He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.\n\nOne day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too.

Write a python script for the following problem: In this problem you need to write job distribution subsystem for testing submissions.\n\nInvokers (simplistically) are components of testing system, which test given submission on single test and give back a verdict. In this problem two verdicts are possible \u2014 OK (test passed) or RJ (rejected, test failed).\n\nJob distribution subsystem will be named scheduler. You have to implement it.\n\nFor each problem two parameters are given: number of tests in a problem and time limit for a problem.\n\nWe will consider that the system works discreetly and one tick equals 10 milliseconds. If some event occupied in time moment not divisible by 10 ms then scheduler will get it in the nearest next tick.\n\nAfter the end of the contest (i.e., a week after its start) the last solution you sent (having positive score) will be chosen to be launched on the final tests. The final tests are confidential and distinct from those that will be used during the competition. The total number of points that will be scored in the final tests will determine the winner of the competition.\n\nSpecially for this round we implemented feature to submit ZIP-archive with multiple source files. All files should be in root of ZIP-file, no directories are allowed. You can use this feature for:\n -  Java 8: main should be in a class Main of default package; -  GNU C++ 11: exactly one file should contain the entry point main, all files to compile should have extension cpp. \nYou will be receiving submissions and invoker verdicts in interactive mode. Please be sure to use the stream flushing operation after each of your moves to prevent output buffering. For example, you can use \"fflush(stdout)\" in C or C++, \"System.out.flush()\" in Java and \"flush(output)\" in Pascal.\n\nThe problem is estimated as follows: let *a**i* is a full testing time (including expectations) of the *i*-th submission, that is time, passed from the moment of receiving the submission until the moment when it is fully tested. Let's find , where *n* is the number of submissions to test. The exact number of points for single test is calculated by the formula , where *A* is a *r* for some simple scheduler, written by jury, and *B* is a *r* for your scheduler.\n\nMaterials for local testing will be published soon. The package with materials will contain an interactor and a set of test data for the interactor.\nInput specification: On the start your program reads the following data from standard input:\n -  in the first line you are given an integer number *t* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=500) \u2014 the number of available invokers (all invokers work simultaneously and independently, free invoker starts testing a job as soon as it is appointed to him); -  in the second line you are given an integer number *p* (1<=\u2264<=*p*<=\u2264<=10000) \u2014 the number of problems, submissions to which are expected to be tested. \nFurther *p* lines with description of problems are followed. Each description contains problem time limit (integer number between 250 and 30000) and the number of tests (from 1 to 1000). \n\nThe following data is given in interactive mode. It means that a following block of data will be available only after your scheduler writes information of its behavior on the previous tick. Firstly, block of data about new submissions, needed to be tested, follows for a tick. Each submission is described by single integer number \u2014 index of the problem (from 0 to *p*<=-<=1). The value -1 means that there are no new submissions, needed to be tested, in this tick.\n\nFurther block of testing results (from invokers) in this tick follows. These lines contain three elements: index of submission, a number of test and the verdict of test (OK or RJ). The block of testing results ends with a line \"-1 -1\".\n\nConsider that problems and tests are numbered (from zero) in the order of its appearance. Total number of submissions for one test does not exceed 20000.. Output specification: After reading the data about the next tick your scheduler can decide to send submissions for exact testing. The submission can be tested in any test at any time. Your scheduler must output a couple of integers \u2014 index of submission and a number of test in a single line in order to start a test for the submission. If there are a free invoker, a testing of a submission immediately begins (invoker becomes busy until the result comes back). Otherwise, your request will be ignored. When you are done sending requests, output line \"-1 -1\".\n\nYou can simply maintain the amount of free invokers in your program, reducing each time variable *t* while sending the task to invokers (if *t*<==<=0, there is no need to send) and increasing *t*, if invoker returns a verdict. \n\nIt is considered that the submission was tested if it was tested on all tests of the problem, or if it was tested on all tests up to first RJ verdict (inclusive).\n\nInteractor breaks out at a time when all the planned submissions will be tested completely. In this case your submission should stop, as soon as it finds closing of input data stream.\nDemo input: ['1\\n1\\n500 2\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n0\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n0\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n0 0 OK\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n0 1 OK\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n-1 -1\\n-1\\n1 0 RJ\\n-1 -1\\n'], Demo output: ['-1 -1\\n-1 -1\\n-1 -1\\n-1 -1\\n-1 -1\\n0 0\\n-1 -1\\n-1 -1\\n-1 -1\\n-1 -1\\n-1 -1\\n0 1\\n-1 -1\\n-1 -1\\n-1 -1\\n-1 -1\\n-1 -1\\n-1 -1\\n1 0\\n-1 -1\\n-1 -1\\n-1 -1\\n-1 -1\\n-1 -1\\n-1 -1\\n1 1\\n-1 -1\\n']\nNote: Materials and tests are available now at [http://assets.codeforces.com/files/vk/vkcup-2016-wr2-materials-v1.tar.gz](//assets.codeforces.com/files/vk/vkcup-2016-wr2-materials-v1.tar.gz).

The Dark Lord is going to be busy sucking life out of Ginny.\n\nThe Chamber of Secrets is an *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* rectangular grid in which some of the cells are columns. A light ray (and a basilisk's gaze) passes through the columns without changing its direction. But with some spell we can make a column magic to reflect the light ray (or the gaze) in all four directions when it receives the ray. This is shown in the figure below.\n\nThe basilisk is located at the right side of the lower right cell of the grid and is looking to the left (in the direction of the lower left cell). According to the legend, anyone who meets a basilisk's gaze directly dies immediately. But if someone meets a basilisk's gaze through a column, this person will get petrified. We know that the door to the Chamber is located on the left side of the upper left corner of the grid and anyone who wants to enter will look in the direction of its movement (in the direction of the upper right cell) from that position.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the chamber and the location of regular columns, Lord Voldemort has asked you to find the minimum number of columns that we need to make magic so that anyone who wants to enter the chamber would be petrified or just declare that it's impossible to secure the chamber.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integer numbers *n* and *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000).

A dormitory is a whole new world of funny amusements and possibilities but it does have its drawbacks. \n\nThere is only one shower and there are multiple students who wish to have a shower in the morning. That's why every morning there is a line of five people in front of the dormitory shower door. As soon as the shower opens, the first person from the line enters the shower. After a while the first person leaves the shower and the next person enters the shower. The process continues until everybody in the line has a shower.\n\nHaving a shower takes some time, so the students in the line talk as they wait.

As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1.

Write a python script for the following problem: Developers often face with regular expression patterns. A pattern is usually defined as a string consisting of characters and metacharacters that sets the rules for your search. These patterns are most often used to check whether a particular string meets the certain rules.\n\nIn this task, a pattern will be a string consisting of small English letters and question marks ('?'). The question mark in the pattern is a metacharacter that denotes an arbitrary small letter of the English alphabet. We will assume that a string matches the pattern if we can transform the string into the pattern by replacing the question marks by the appropriate characters. For example, string aba matches patterns: ???, ??a, a?a, aba.\n\nProgrammers that work for the R1 company love puzzling each other (and themselves) with riddles. One of them is as follows: you are given *n* patterns of the same length, you need to find a pattern that contains as few question marks as possible, and intersects with each of the given patterns. Two patterns intersect if there is a string that matches both the first and the second pattern.

Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$.. Output specification: Print the only integer \u2014 maximum possible total time when the lamp is lit.\nDemo input: ['3 10\\n4 6 7\\n', '2 12\\n1 10\\n', '2 7\\n3 4\\n'], Demo output: ['8\\n', '9\\n', '6\\n']\nNote: In the first example, one of possible optimal solutions is to insert value $x = 3$ before $a_1$, so program will be $[3, 4, 6, 7]$ and time of lamp being lit equals $(3 - 0) + (6 - 4) + (10 - 7) = 8$. Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$."}]}}

We should remind you that a string is called a palindrome if it can be read the same way both from left to right and from right to left. Here are examples of such strings: \u00abeye\u00bb, \u00abpop\u00bb, \u00ablevel\u00bb, \u00ababa\u00bb, \u00abdeed\u00bb, \u00abracecar\u00bb, \u00abrotor\u00bb, \u00abmadam\u00bb. \n\nNick started to look carefully for all palindromes in the text that they were reading in the class. For each occurrence of each palindrome in the text he wrote a pair \u2014 the position of the beginning and the position of the ending of this occurrence in the text. Nick called each occurrence of each palindrome he found in the text subpalindrome. When he found all the subpalindromes, he decided to find out how many different pairs among these subpalindromes cross. Two subpalindromes cross if they cover common positions in the text. No palindrome can cross itself.\n\nLet's look at the actions, performed by Nick, by the example of text \u00abbabb\u00bb.

These pairs were six:\n\nSince it's very exhausting to perform all the described actions manually, Nick asked you to help him and write a program that can find out the amount of different subpalindrome pairs that cross.

Petya wanted to create a maximally simple language that would be enough to chat with friends, that's why all the language's grammar can be described with the following set of rules:\n-  There are three parts of speech: the adjective, the noun, the verb. Each word in his language is an adjective, noun or verb. -  There are two genders: masculine and feminine. Each word in his language has gender either masculine or feminine. -  Masculine adjectives end with -lios, and feminine adjectives end with -liala. -  Masculine nouns end with -etr, and feminime nouns end with -etra. -  Masculine verbs end with -initis, and feminime verbs end with -inites. -  Thus, each word in the Petya's language has one of the six endings, given above. There are no other endings in Petya's language. -  It is accepted that the whole word consists of an ending. That is, words \"lios\", \"liala\", \"etr\" and so on belong to the Petya's language. -  There aren't any punctuation marks, grammatical tenses, singular/plural forms or other language complications. -  A sentence is either exactly one valid language word or exactly one statement. \nStatement is any sequence of the Petya's language, that satisfy both conditions:\n-  Words in statement follow in the following order (from the left to the right): zero or more adjectives followed by exactly one noun followed by zero or more verbs. -  All words in the statement should have the same gender.\nAfter Petya's friend Vasya wrote instant messenger (an instant messaging program) that supported the Petya's language, Petya wanted to add spelling and grammar checking to the program. As Vasya was in the country and Petya didn't feel like waiting, he asked you to help him with this problem.

Thus, for each of the *n* pairs she knows if there will be a class at that time or not.\n\nAlena's House is far from the university, so if there are breaks, she doesn't always go home. Alena has time to go home only if the break consists of at least two free pairs in a row, otherwise she waits for the next pair at the university.\n\nOf course, Alena does not want to be sleepy during pairs, so she will sleep as long as possible, and will only come to the first pair that is presented in her schedule.

Ever since, she tried to avoid contact with others, for fear that this secret might be noticed.\n\nTo get rid of the oddity and recover her weight, a special integer sequence is needed. Hitagi's sequence has been broken for a long time, but now Kaiki provides an opportunity.\n\nHitagi's sequence *a* has a length of *n*. Lost elements in it are denoted by zeros. Kaiki provides another sequence *b*, whose length *k* equals the number of lost elements in *a* (i.e. the number of zeros). Hitagi is to replace each zero in *a* with an element from *b* so that each element in *b* should be used exactly once. Hitagi knows, however, that, apart from 0, no integer occurs in *a* and *b* more than once in total.\n\nIf the resulting sequence is not an increasing sequence, then it has the power to recover Hitagi from the oddity. You are to determine whether this is possible, or Kaiki's sequence is just another fake. In other words, you should detect whether it is possible to replace each zero in *a* with an integer from *b* so that each integer from *b* is used exactly once, and the resulting sequence is not increasing.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains two space-separated positive integers *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the lengths of sequence *a* and *b* respectively.\n\nThe second line contains *n* space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=200) \u2014 Hitagi's broken sequence with exactly *k* zero elements.\n\nThe third line contains *k* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**k* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=200) \u2014 the elements to fill into Hitagi's sequence.\n\nInput guarantees that apart from 0, no integer occurs in *a* and *b* more than once in total..

In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body.

The game is played by two persons: operator and player. Operator takes three similar opaque shells and places a ball beneath one of them. Then he shuffles the shells by swapping some pairs and the player has to guess the current position of the ball.\n\nBomboslav noticed that guys are not very inventive, so the operator always swaps the left shell with the middle one during odd moves (first, third, fifth, etc.) and always swaps the middle shell with the right one during even moves (second, fourth, etc.).\n\nLet's number shells from 0 to 2 from left to right. Thus the left shell is assigned number 0, the middle shell is 1 and the right shell is 2. Bomboslav has missed the moment when the ball was placed beneath the shell, but he knows that exactly *n* movements were made by the operator and the ball was under shell *x* at the end.

During the first move operator swapped the left shell and the middle shell. The ball is now under the left shell. 1.  During the second move operator swapped the middle shell and the right one. The ball is still under the left shell. 1.  During the third move operator swapped the left shell and the middle shell again. The ball is again in the middle. 1.  Finally, the operators swapped the middle shell and the right shell. The ball is now beneath the right shell."}]}}

Output specification: Print the only integer \u2014 the minimum value of *v* that lets Vasya write the program in one night.\nDemo input: ['7 2\\n', '59 9\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n', '54\\n']\nNote: In the first sample the answer is *v*\u2009=\u20094. Vasya writes the code in the following portions: first 4 lines, then 2, then 1, and then Vasya falls asleep. Thus, he manages to write 4\u2009+\u20092\u2009+\u20091\u2009=\u20097 lines in a night and complete the task.\n\nIn the second sample the answer is *v*\u2009=\u200954. Vasya writes the code in the following portions: 54, 6. The total sum is 54\u2009+\u20096\u2009=\u200960, that's even more than *n*\u2009=\u200959."}]}}

Independent researchers confirmed that the nervous system of a zombie is highly complicated \u2013 it consists of *n* brains (much like a cow has several stomachs). They are interconnected by brain connectors, which are veins capable of transmitting thoughts between brains. There are two important properties such a brain network should have to function properly: \n 1.  It should be possible to exchange thoughts between any two pairs of brains (perhaps indirectly, through other brains). 1.  There should be no redundant brain connectors, that is, removing any brain connector would make property 1 false. \nIf both properties are satisfied, we say that the nervous system is valid.
