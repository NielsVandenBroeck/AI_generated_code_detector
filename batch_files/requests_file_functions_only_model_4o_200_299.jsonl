For example, number sequence written like \"1,2\u00a0,3,...,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a010\" will be corrected to \"1,\u00a02,\u00a03,\u00a0...,\u00a010\".\n\nIn this task you are given a string *s*, which is composed by a concatination of terms, each of which may be: \n -  a positive integer of an arbitrary length (leading zeroes are not allowed), -  a \"comma\" symbol (\",\"), -  a \"space\" symbol (\" \"), -  \"three dots\" (\"...\", that is, exactly three points written one after another, also known as suspension points). \nPolycarp wants to add and remove spaces in the string *s* to ensure the following: \n -  each comma is followed by exactly one space (if the comma is the last character in the string, this rule does not apply to it), -  each \"three dots\" term is preceded by exactly one space (if the dots are at the beginning of the string, this rule does not apply to the term), -  if two consecutive numbers were separated by spaces only (one or more), then exactly one of them should be left, -  there should not be other spaces. \nAutomate Polycarp's work and write a program that will process the given string *s*.\nInput specification: The input data contains a single string *s*.

On the positions from second to fifth the elements became larger, so the answer for this permutation is 4.\n\nIn the second sample, there is no way to increase any element with a permutation, so the answer is 0."}]}}

The third line contains *m* distinct integers *p**i* in ascending order (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=1010, *p**i*<=&lt;<=*p**i*<=+<=1) - the numbers of tracks to read.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is recommended to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.. Output specification: Print a single number \u2014 the minimum time required, in seconds, to read all the needed tracks.\nDemo input: ['3 4\\n2 5 6\\n1 3 6 8\\n', '3 3\\n1 2 3\\n1 2 3\\n', '1 2\\n165\\n142 200\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '0\\n', '81\\n']\nNote: The first test coincides with the figure. In this case the given tracks can be read in 2 seconds in the following way: \n 1.  during the first second move the 1-st head to the left and let it stay there; 1.  move the second head to the left twice; 1.  move the third head to the right twice (note that the 6-th track has already been read at the beginning). \nOne cannot read the tracks in 1 second as the 3-rd head is at distance 2 from the 8-th track."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Far Far Away lived Sam the Farmer. Sam had a cow named Dawn and he was deeply attached to her. Sam would spend the whole summer stocking hay to feed Dawn in winter. Sam scythed hay and put it into haystack. As Sam was a bright farmer, he tried to make the process of storing hay simpler and more convenient to use. He collected the hay into cubical hay blocks of the same size. Then he stored the blocks in his barn. After a summer spent in hard toil Sam stored *A*\u00b7*B*\u00b7*C* hay blocks and stored them in a barn as a rectangular parallelepiped *A* layers high. Each layer had *B* rows and each row had *C* blocks.\n\nAt the end of the autumn Sam came into the barn to admire one more time the hay he'd been stacking during this hard summer. Unfortunately, Sam was horrified to see that the hay blocks had been carelessly scattered around the barn. The place was a complete mess. As it turned out, thieves had sneaked into the barn. They completely dissembled and took away a layer of blocks from the parallelepiped's front, back, top and sides. As a result, the barn only had a parallelepiped containing (*A*<=-<=1)<=\u00d7<=(*B*<=-<=2)<=\u00d7<=(*C*<=-<=2) hay blocks. To hide the evidence of the crime, the thieves had dissembled the parallelepiped into single 1<=\u00d7<=1<=\u00d7<=1 blocks and scattered them around the barn. After the theft Sam counted *n* hay blocks in the barn but he forgot numbers *A*, *B* \u0438 *C*.\n\nGiven number *n*, find the minimally possible and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks.\nInput specification: The only line contains integer *n* from the problem's statement (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=109)..

Will the equation remain correct after removing all zeros?\n\nFor example if the equation is 101<=+<=102<==<=203, if we removed all zeros it will be 11<=+<=12<==<=23 which is still a correct equation.\n\nBut if the equation is 105<=+<=106<==<=211, if we removed all zeros it will be 15<=+<=16<==<=211 which is not a correct equation.\nInput specification: The input will consist of two lines, the first line will contain the integer *a*, and the second line will contain the integer *b* which are in the equation as described above (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=109). There won't be any leading zeros in both. The value of *c* should be calculated as *c*<==<=*a*<=+<=*b*.. Output specification: The output will be just one line, you should print \"YES\" if the equation will remain correct after removing all zeros, and print \"NO\" otherwise.\nDemo input: ['101\\n102\\n', '105\\n106\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture.

Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy.

Write a python script for the following problem: In one little known, but very beautiful country called Waterland, lives a lovely shark Valerie. Like all the sharks, she has several rows of teeth, and feeds on crucians. One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are \"relaxing\".\n\nFor a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap).\n\nIt turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again. \n\nUnhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her. For sure, the shark couldn't say no to her favourite meal, but she had no desire to go back to the dentist. That's why she decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that the viability of no tooth becomes negative. \n\nAs Valerie is not good at mathematics, she asked you to help her to find out the total amount of crucians that she can consume for dinner.\n\nWe should remind you that while eating one crucian Valerie uses exactly one row of teeth and the viability of each tooth from this row decreases by one.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000,<=0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 total amount of Valerie's teeth, amount of tooth rows and amount of crucians in Valerie's portion for dinner.

As the lecture was boring, Vasya decided to complete the picture by composing a graph *G* with the following properties: \n -  *G* has exactly *n* vertices, numbered from 1 to *n*. -  For all pairs of vertices *i* and *j*, where *i*<=\u2260<=*j*, there is an edge connecting them if and only if characters *s**i* and *s**j* are either equal or neighbouring in the alphabet. That is, letters in pairs \"a\"-\"b\" and \"b\"-\"c\" are neighbouring, while letters \"a\"-\"c\" are not. \nVasya painted the resulting graph near the string and then erased the string. Next day Vasya's friend Petya came to a lecture and found some graph at his desk. He had heard of Vasya's adventure and now he wants to find out whether it could be the original graph *G*, painted by Vasya.
