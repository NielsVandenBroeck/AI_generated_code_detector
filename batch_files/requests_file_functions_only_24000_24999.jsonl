The tree consists of *n* nodes numbered from 1 to *n*, each node *i* having an initial value *a**i*. The root of the tree is node 1.\n\nThis tree has a special property: when a value *val* is added to a value of node *i*, the value -*val* is added to values of all the children of node *i*. Note that when you add value -*val* to a child of node *i*, you also add -(-*val*) to all children of the child of node *i* and so on.

For example, {0,<=1,<=0,<=1}, {1,<=0,<=1}, and {1,<=0,<=1,<=0} are alternating sequences, while {1,<=0,<=0} and {0,<=1,<=0,<=1,<=1} are not.\n\nKevin, being the sneaky little puffball that he is, is willing to hack into the USAICO databases to improve his score.

The wires are considered entangled if there are one or more places where one wire runs above the other one. For example, the picture below has four such places (top view):\n\nMike knows the sequence in which the wires run above each other.

Some cells were wasteland, and other each cell contained crop plants: either carrots or kiwis or grapes. \n\nAfter seeing the field carefully, Ciel found that the crop plants of each cell were planted in following procedure:\n -  Assume that the rows are numbered 1 to *n* from top to bottom and the columns are numbered 1 to *m* from left to right, and a cell in row *i* and column *j* is represented as (*i*,<=*j*). -  First, each field is either cultivated or waste.

Waste cells will be ignored. -  Crop plants (either carrots or kiwis or grapes) will be planted in each cell one after another cyclically. Carrots will be planted in the first cell, then kiwis in the second one, grapes in the third one, carrots in the forth one, kiwis in the fifth one, and so on. \nThe following figure will show you the example of this procedure.

Byteforces is a country that consists of *n* cities, connected by *n*<=-<=1 bidirectional roads. Every road connects exactly two distinct cities, and the whole road system is designed in a way that one is able to go from any city to any other city using only the given roads. There are *m* cities being attacked by humans. So Ari... we meant Super M have to immediately go to each of the cities being attacked to scare those bad humans. Super M can pass from one city to another only using the given roads. Moreover, passing through one road takes her exactly one kron - the time unit used in Byteforces. \n\nHowever, Super M is not on Byteforces now - she is attending a training camp located in a nearby country Codeforces. Fortunately, there is a special device in Codeforces that allows her to instantly teleport from Codeforces to any city of Byteforces. The way back is too long, so for the purpose of this problem teleportation is used exactly once.\n\nYou are to help Super M, by calculating the city in which she should teleport at the beginning in order to end her job in the minimum time (measured in krons).

Write a python script for the following problem: Bob is a farmer. He has a large pasture with many sheep. Recently, he has lost some of them due to wolf attacks. He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of dogs.\nDemo input: ['6 6\\n..S...\\n..S.W.\\n.S....\\n..W...\\n...W..\\n......\\n', '1 2\\nSW\\n', '5 5\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS....\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n..SD..\\n..SDW.\\n.SD...\\n.DW...\\nDD.W..\\n......\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS.D..\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n']\nNote: In the first example, we can split the pasture into two halves, one containing wolves and one containing sheep. Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.\n\nVasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest \"Shift\" key is strictly larger than *x*. In this case he will have to use his other hand. Having typed the symbol, Vasya returns other hand back to the chips.\n\nYou are given Vasya's keyboard and the text.

People live in cells. However, it was hard to move between distinct cells, because of the difficulty of escaping the cell. People wanted to meet people who live in other cells.\n\nSo, user tncks0121 has made a transportation system to move between these cells, to celebrate the New Year. First, he thought of *n*<=-<=1 positive integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1. For every integer *i* where 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1 the condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* holds. Next, he made *n*<=-<=1 portals, numbered by integers from 1 to *n*<=-<=1. The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) portal connects cell *i* and cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*), and one can travel from cell *i* to cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) using the *i*-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) to cell *i* using the *i*-th portal. It is easy to see that because of condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* one can't leave the Line World using portals.\n\nCurrently, I am standing at cell 1, and I want to go to cell *t*.

Write a python script for the following problem: Merge sort is a well-known sorting algorithm. The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:\n 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=\u2264<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* \u2014 *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\nInput specification: The first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it..

Otherwise output *n* integer numbers *a*[0],<=*a*[1],<=...,<=*a*[*n*<=-<=1] \u2014 the elements of a permutation that would meet the required conditions.

He happens to know which ones out of the *N*<=-<=1 roads in Ruritania are currently unidirectional, but he is unable to compute the least amount of money he needs to prepare for bribing the police. Help Borna by providing him with an answer and you will be richly rewarded.\nInput specification: The first line contains *N*, the number of towns in Ruritania. The following *N*<=-<=1 lines contain information regarding individual roads between towns. A road is represented by a tuple of integers (*a*,*b*,*x*), which are separated with a single whitespace character. The numbers *a* and *b* represent the cities connected by this particular road, and x is either 0 or 1: 0 means that the road is bidirectional, 1 means that only the *a*<=\u2192<=*b* direction is legal. The next line contains *K*, the number of stops Borna has to make. The final line of input contains K positive integers *s*1,<=\u2026,<=*s**K*: the towns Borna has to visit.\n -  1<=\u2264<=*N*<=\u2264<=105 -  1<=\u2264<=*K*<=\u2264<=106 -  1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=*N* for all roads -   for all roads -  1<=\u2264<=*s**i*<=\u2264<=*N* for all 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*K*. Output specification: The output should contain a single number: the least amount of thousands of Ruritanian dinars Borna should allocate for bribes, modulo 109<=+<=7.\nDemo input: ['5\\n1 2 0\\n2 3 0\\n5 1 1\\n3 4 1\\n5\\n5 4 5 2 2\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n']\nNote: Borna first takes the route 1\u2009\u2192\u20095 and has to pay 1000 dinars. After that, he takes the route 5\u2009\u2192\u20091\u2009\u2192\u20092\u2009\u2192\u20093\u2009\u2192\u20094 and pays nothing this time. However, when he has to return via 4\u2009\u2192\u20093\u2009\u2192\u20092\u2009\u2192\u20091\u2009\u2192\u20095, he needs to prepare 3000 (1000+2000) dinars. Afterwards, getting to 2 via 5\u2009\u2192\u20091\u2009\u2192\u20092 will cost him nothing. Finally, he doesn't even have to leave town 2 to get to 2, so there is no need to prepare any additional bribe money. Hence he has to prepare 4000 dinars in total."}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the elements of array. \n\nThe third line contains integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs. Separate the numbers by spaces.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nDemo input: ['2\\n1 2\\n1\\n1\\n', '2\\n2 1\\n1\\n1\\n', '3\\n3 1 2\\n3\\n1 2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['1 2\\n', '2 1\\n', '6 6\\n']\nNote: In the first sample Vasya's approach will make one comparison (it starts with the 1-st element and immediately finds the required number), and Petya's approach makes two comparisons (first he compares with the 2-nd array element, doesn't find the search item and compares with the 1-st element).\n\nIn the second sample, on the contrary, Vasya's approach will need two comparisons (first with 1-st element, and then with the 2-nd), and Petya's approach will find the required value in one comparison (the first comparison with the 2-nd element)."}]}}

For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.\n\nIt's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.\n\nIt's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.\n\nIn this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.\n\nDetermine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of round participants.\n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains two integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=4126)\u00a0\u2014 the rating of the *i*-th participant before and after the round, respectively.

Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.\n\nIn the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not."}]}}

To achieve this goal, Polycarp has spent several hours in front of his laptop and implemented a chat server that can process three types of commands:\n -  Include a person to the chat ('Add' command). -  Remove a person from the chat ('Remove' command). -  Send a message from a person to all people, who are currently in the chat, including the one, who sends the message ('Send' command). \nNow Polycarp wants to find out the amount of outgoing traffic that the server will produce while processing a particular set of commands.\n\nPolycarp knows that chat server sends no traffic for 'Add' and 'Remove' commands. When 'Send' command is processed, server sends *l* bytes to each participant of the chat, where *l* is the length of the message.\n\nAs Polycarp has no time, he is asking for your help in solving this problem.\nInput specification: Input file will contain not more than 100 commands, each in its own line. No line will exceed 100 characters. Formats of the commands will be the following:\n -  +&lt;name&gt; for 'Add' command. -  -&lt;name&gt; for 'Remove' command. -  &lt;sender_name&gt;:&lt;message_text&gt; for 'Send' command. \n&lt;name&gt; and &lt;sender_name&gt; is a non-empty sequence of Latin letters and digits. &lt;message_text&gt; can contain letters, digits and spaces, but can't start or end with a space. &lt;message_text&gt; can be an empty line.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that input data are correct, i.e. there will be no 'Add' command if person with such a name is already in the chat, there will be no 'Remove' command if there is no person with such a name in the chat etc.\n\nAll names are case-sensitive.. Output specification: Print a single number \u2014 answer to the problem.\nDemo input: ['+Mike\\nMike:hello\\n+Kate\\n+Dmitry\\n-Dmitry\\nKate:hi\\n-Kate\\n', '+Mike\\n-Mike\\n+Mike\\nMike:Hi   I am here\\n-Mike\\n+Kate\\n-Kate\\n'], Demo output: ['9\\n', '14\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

For example, {0,<=1,<=0,<=1}, {1,<=0,<=1}, and {1,<=0,<=1,<=0} are alternating sequences, while {1,<=0,<=0} and {0,<=1,<=0,<=1,<=1} are not.\n\nKevin, being the sneaky little puffball that he is, is willing to hack into the USAICO databases to improve his score.

Like all the sharks, she has several rows of teeth, and feeds on crucians. One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are \"relaxing\".\n\nFor a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap).\n\nIt turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again. \n\nUnhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her.

However, Vasilisa the Wise does not know what the box's secret is, since she cannot open it again. She hopes that you will help her one more time with that.\n\nThe box's lock looks as follows: it contains 4 identical deepenings for gems as a 2<=\u00d7<=2 square, and some integer numbers are written at the lock's edge near the deepenings. The example of a lock is given on the picture below.\n\nThe box is accompanied with 9 gems.

In one move, you can apply a single transformation to the matrix: choose an arbitrary element of the matrix and increase it by 1. Each element can be increased an arbitrary number of times.\n\nYou are really curious about prime numbers. Let us remind you that a prime number is a positive integer that has exactly two distinct positive integer divisors: itself and number one. For example, numbers 2, 3, 5 are prime and numbers 1, 4, 6 are not. \n\nA matrix is prime if at least one of the two following conditions fulfills:\n -  the matrix has a row with prime numbers only; -  the matrix has a column with prime numbers only; \nYour task is to count the minimum number of moves needed to get a prime matrix from the one you've got.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n*,<=*m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=500) \u2014 the number of rows and columns in the matrix, correspondingly.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains *m* integers \u2014 the initial matrix. All matrix elements are positive integers. All numbers in the initial matrix do not exceed 105.\n\nThe numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.. Output specification: Print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of moves needed to get a prime matrix from the one you've got. If you've got a prime matrix, print 0.\nDemo input: ['3 3\\n1 2 3\\n5 6 1\\n4 4 1\\n', '2 3\\n4 8 8\\n9 2 9\\n', '2 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '3\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: In the first sample you need to increase number 1 in cell (1, 1). Thus, the first row will consist of prime numbers: 2, 2, 3.\n\nIn the second sample you need to increase number 8 in cell (1, 2) three times. Thus, the second column will consist of prime numbers: 11, 2.\n\nIn the third sample you don't have to do anything as the second column already consists of prime numbers: 3, 2."}]}}

Indeed, unoccupied houses can be purchased.\n\nYou will be given *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* that denote the availability and the prices of the houses. If house *i* is occupied, and therefore cannot be bought, then *a**i* equals 0.

The only limitation that Vasya has \u2014 he does not want to do the same activity on two consecutive days: it means, he will not do sport on two consecutive days, and write the contest on two consecutive days.\nInput specification: The first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of days of Vasya's vacations.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence of integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=3) separated by space, where: \n -  *a**i* equals 0, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is closed and the contest is not carried out; -  *a**i* equals 1, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is closed, but the contest is carried out; -  *a**i* equals 2, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is open and the contest is not carried out; -  *a**i* equals 3, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is open and the contest is carried out.. Output specification: Print the minimum possible number of days on which Vasya will have a rest. Remember that Vasya refuses:\n -  to do sport on any two consecutive days, -  to write the contest on any two consecutive days.\nDemo input: ['4\\n1 3 2 0\\n', '7\\n1 3 3 2 1 2 3\\n', '2\\n2 2\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '0\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: In the first test Vasya can write the contest on the day number 1 and do sport on the day number 3. Thus, he will have a rest for only 2 days.\n\nIn the second test Vasya should write contests on days number 1, 3, 5 and 7, in other days do sport. Thus, he will not have a rest for a single day.\n\nIn the third test Vasya can do sport either on a day number 1 or number 2. He can not do sport in two days, because it will be contrary to the his limitation. Thus, he will have a rest for only one day."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: One particularly well-known fact about zombies is that they move and think terribly slowly. While we still don't know why their movements are so sluggish, the problem of laggy thinking has been recently resolved. It turns out that the reason is not (as previously suspected) any kind of brain defect \u2013 it's the opposite! Independent researchers confirmed that the nervous system of a zombie is highly complicated \u2013 it consists of *n* brains (much like a cow has several stomachs). They are interconnected by brain connectors, which are veins capable of transmitting thoughts between brains. There are two important properties such a brain network should have to function properly: \n 1.  It should be possible to exchange thoughts between any two pairs of brains (perhaps indirectly, through other brains). 1.  There should be no redundant brain connectors, that is, removing any brain connector would make property 1 false. \nIf both properties are satisfied, we say that the nervous system is valid. Unfortunately (?), if the system is not valid, the zombie stops thinking and becomes (even more) dead. Your task is to analyze a given nervous system of a zombie and find out whether it is valid.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000) denoting the number of brains (which are conveniently numbered from 1 to *n*) and the number of brain connectors in the nervous system, respectively.

Write a python script for the following problem: Little Artem likes electronics. He can spend lots of time making different schemas and looking for novelties in the nearest electronics store. The new control element was delivered to the store recently and Artem immediately bought it.\n\nThat element can store information about the matrix of integers size *n*<=\u00d7<=*m*. There are *n*<=+<=*m* inputs in that element, i.e. each row and each column can get the signal. When signal comes to the input corresponding to some row, this row cyclically shifts to the left, that is the first element of the row becomes last element, second element becomes first and so on. When signal comes to the input corresponding to some column, that column shifts cyclically to the top, that is first element of the column becomes last element, second element becomes first and so on. Rows are numbered with integers from 1 to *n* from top to bottom, while columns are numbered with integers from 1 to *m* from left to right.\n\nArtem wants to carefully study this element before using it. For that purpose he is going to set up an experiment consisting of *q* turns. On each turn he either sends the signal to some input or checks what number is stored at some position of the matrix.\n\nArtem has completed his experiment and has written down the results, but he has lost the chip!

Write a python script for the following problem: After the big birthday party, Katie still wanted Shiro to have some more fun. Later, she came up with a game called treasure hunt. Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\n\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.. Output specification: Print the name of the winner (\"Kuro\", \"Shiro\" or \"Katie\"). If there are at least two cats that share the maximum beauty, print \"Draw\".\nDemo input: ['3\\nKuroo\\nShiro\\nKatie\\n', '7\\ntreasurehunt\\nthreefriends\\nhiCodeforces\\n', '1\\nabcabc\\ncbabac\\nababca\\n', '15\\nfoPaErcvJ\\nmZaxowpbt\\nmkuOlaHRE\\n'], Demo output: ['Kuro\\n', 'Shiro\\n', 'Katie\\n', 'Draw\\n']\nNote: In the first example, after $3$ turns, Kuro can change his ribbon into ooooo, which has the beauty of $5$, while reaching such beauty for Shiro and Katie is impossible (both Shiro and Katie can reach the beauty of at most $4$, for example by changing Shiro's ribbon into SSiSS and changing Katie's ribbon into Kaaaa). Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice.

Like all the sharks, she has several rows of teeth, and feeds on crucians. One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are \"relaxing\".\n\nFor a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap).\n\nIt turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again. \n\nUnhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her. For sure, the shark couldn't say no to her favourite meal, but she had no desire to go back to the dentist. That's why she decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that the viability of no tooth becomes negative. \n\nAs Valerie is not good at mathematics, she asked you to help her to find out the total amount of crucians that she can consume for dinner.\n\nWe should remind you that while eating one crucian Valerie uses exactly one row of teeth and the viability of each tooth from this row decreases by one.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000,<=0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 total amount of Valerie's teeth, amount of tooth rows and amount of crucians in Valerie's portion for dinner.

Of course, big snacks should be at the bottom of the tower, while small snacks should be at the top.\n\nYears passed, and once different snacks started to fall onto the city, and the residents began to build the Snacktower.\n\nHowever, they faced some troubles. Each day exactly one snack fell onto the city, but their order was strange. So, at some days the residents weren't able to put the new stack on the top of the Snacktower: they had to wait until all the bigger snacks fell. Of course, in order to not to anger miss Fortune again, the residents placed each snack on the top of the tower immediately as they could do it.\n\nWrite a program that models the behavior of Ankh-Morpork residents.\nInput specification: The first line contains single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the total number of snacks.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers, the *i*-th of them equals the size of the snack which fell on the *i*-th day. Sizes are distinct integers from 1 to *n*.. Output specification: Print *n* lines. On the *i*-th of them print the sizes of the snacks which the residents placed on the top of the Snacktower on the *i*-th day in the order they will do that. If no snack is placed on some day, leave the corresponding line empty.\nDemo input: ['3\\n3 1 2\\n', '5\\n4 5 1 2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n\\xa0\\n2 1', '5 4\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n3 2 1\\n']\nNote: In the example a snack of size 3 fell on the first day, and the residents immediately placed it. On the second day a snack of size 1 fell, and the residents weren't able to place it because they were missing the snack of size 2. On the third day a snack of size 2 fell, and the residents immediately placed it. Right after that they placed the snack of size 1 which had fallen before."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes. The second line contains integers *x**c* and *y**c* \u2014 the initial square's coordinates (1<=\u2264<=*x**c*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y**c*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nThe third line contains an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the number of vectors. Then follow *k* lines, each of them contains two integers *dx**i* and *dy**i* (|*dx**i*|,<=|*dy**i*|<=\u2264<=109,<=|*dx*|<=+<=|*dy*|<=\u2265<=1).. Output specification: Print the single number \u2014 the number of steps Vasya had made.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.\nDemo input: ['4 5\\n1 1\\n3\\n1 1\\n1 1\\n0 -2\\n', '10 10\\n1 2\\n1\\n-1 0\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: In the first sample Vasya is initially positioned at square (1,\u20091) and makes 3 steps by the first vector (1,\u20091). So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091). He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

That's why he decided to obfuscate (intentionally make less readable) his code before upcoming contest.\n\nTo obfuscate the code, Kostya first looks at the first variable name used in his program and replaces all its occurrences with a single symbol *a*, then he looks at the second variable name that has not been replaced yet, and replaces all its occurrences with *b*, and so on. Kostya is well-mannered, so he doesn't use any one-letter names before obfuscation.

Write a python script for the following problem: First-rate specialists graduate from Berland State Institute of Peace and Friendship. You are one of the most talented students in this university. The education is not easy because you need to have fundamental knowledge in different areas, which sometimes are not related to each other. \n\nFor example, you should know linguistics very well. You learn a structure of Reberland language as foreign language. In this language words are constructed according to the following rules. First you need to choose the \"root\" of the word \u2014 some string which has more than 4 letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3 symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction \u2014  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row. All these strings are considered to be suffixes of the word (this time we use word \"suffix\" to describe a morpheme but not the few last characters of the string as you may used to). \n\nHere is one exercise that you have found in your task list. You are given the word *s*. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language. \n\nTwo strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match. \n\nLet's look at the example: the word *abacabaca* is given. This word can be obtained in the following ways: , where the root of the word is overlined, and suffixes are marked by \"corners\". Thus, the set of possible suffixes for this word is {*aca*,<=*ba*,<=*ca*}.\nInput specification: The only line contains a string *s* (5<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=104) consisting of lowercase English letters.. Output specification: On the first line print integer *k* \u2014 a number of distinct possible suffixes. On the next *k* lines print suffixes. \n\nPrint suffixes in lexicographical (alphabetical) order.\nDemo input: ['abacabaca\\n', 'abaca\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\naca\\nba\\nca\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: The first test was analysed in the problem statement. \n\nIn the second example the length of the string equals 5. The length of the root equals 5, so no string can be used as a suffix."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: \n -  alloc n \u2014 to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; \nThe memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.\n\nThe first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.\nInput specification: The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100;1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *t* \u2014 the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* \u2014 the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.. Output specification: Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession. Output lines should go in the same order in which the operations are processed. Successful procession of alloc operation should return integers, starting with 1, as the identifiers of the allocated blocks.\nDemo input: ['6 10\\nalloc 5\\nalloc 3\\nerase 1\\nalloc 6\\ndefragment\\nalloc 6\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n2\\nNULL\\n3\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

To untangle the wires, one can first move the \"plus\" wire lower, thus eliminating the two crosses in the middle, and then draw it under the \"minus\" wire, eliminating also the remaining two crosses.\n\nIn the second testcase the \"plus\" wire makes one full revolution around the \"minus\" wire. Thus the wires cannot be untangled: \n\nIn the third testcase the \"plus\" wire simply runs above the \"minus\" wire twice in sequence. The wires can be untangled by lifting \"plus\" and moving it higher: \n\nIn the fourth testcase the \"minus\" wire runs above the \"plus\" wire once. The wires cannot be untangled without moving the device itself:"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Reforms have started in Berland again! At this time, the Parliament is discussing the reform of the calendar. To make the lives of citizens of Berland more varied, it was decided to change the calendar. As more and more people are complaining that \"the years fly by...\", it was decided that starting from the next year the number of days per year will begin to grow. So the coming year will have exactly *a* days, the next after coming year will have *a*<=+<=1 days, the next one will have *a*<=+<=2 days and so on. This schedule is planned for the coming *n* years (in the *n*-th year the length of the year will be equal *a*<=+<=*n*<=-<=1 day).\n\nNo one has yet decided what will become of months. An MP Palevny made the following proposal. \n -  The calendar for each month is comfortable to be printed on a square sheet of paper. We are proposed to make the number of days in each month be the square of some integer. The number of days per month should be the same for each month of any year, but may be different for different years. -  The number of days in each year must be divisible by the number of days per month in this year. This rule ensures that the number of months in each year is an integer. -  The number of days per month for each year must be chosen so as to save the maximum amount of paper to print the calendars. In other words, the number of days per month should be as much as possible. \nThese rules provide an unambiguous method for choosing the number of days in each month for any given year length. For example, according to Palevny's proposition, a year that consists of 108 days will have three months, 36 days each. The year that consists of 99 days will have 11 months, 9 days each, and a year of 365 days will have 365 months, one day each.\n\nThe proposal provoked heated discussion in the community, the famous mathematician Perelmanov quickly calculated that if the proposal is supported, then in a period of *n* years, beginning with the year that has *a* days, the country will spend *p* sheets of paper to print a set of calendars for these years. Perelmanov's calculations take into account the fact that the set will contain one calendar for each year and each month will be printed on a separate sheet.\n\nRepeat Perelmanov's achievement and print the required number *p*. You are given positive integers *a* and *n*. Perelmanov warns you that your program should not work longer than four seconds at the maximum test.\nInput specification: The only input line contains a pair of integers *a*, *n* (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*n*<=\u2264<=107; *a*<=+<=*n*<=-<=1<=\u2264<=107)..

It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nDemo input: ['25 3\\n', '50 5\\n'], Demo output: ['30\\n', '125\\n']\nNote: A note to the first sample test. A year of 25 days will consist of one month containing 25 days. A year of 26 days will consist of 26 months, one day each. A year of 27 days will have three months, 9 days each."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here.

Formally: we number all the planets from $1$ to $n$. $1$ is Earth, $n$ is Mars. Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt. Assume, that the rocket takes off and lands instantly.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 number of planets.\n\nThe second line contains the only integer $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 weight of the payload.\n\nThe third line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$), where $a_i$ is the number of tons, which can be lifted off by one ton of fuel.\n\nThe fourth line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le 1000$), where $b_i$ is the number of tons, which can be landed by one ton of fuel. \n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel.. Output specification: If Natasha can fly to Mars through $(n - 2)$ planets and return to Earth, print the minimum mass of fuel (in tons) that Natasha should take. Otherwise, print a single number $-1$.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel.\n\nThe answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $10^{-6}$.

Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons.-  During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining.-  While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. There will be $14$ tons of rocket with fuel after that.-  During landing on Earth, one ton of fuel can land $7$ tons of cargo, so for landing $14$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel.

The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:\n 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=\u2264<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* \u2014 *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\nInput specification: The first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it..

The tree consists of *n* nodes numbered from 1 to *n*, each node *i* having an initial value *a**i*. The root of the tree is node 1.\n\nThis tree has a special property: when a value *val* is added to a value of node *i*, the value -*val* is added to values of all the children of node *i*. Note that when you add value -*val* to a child of node *i*, you also add -(-*val*) to all children of the child of node *i* and so on. Look an example explanation to understand better how it works.\n\nThis tree supports two types of queries:\n -  \"1 *x* *val*\" \u2014 *val* is added to the value of node *x*; -  \"2 *x*\" \u2014 print the current value of node *x*. \nIn order to help Iahub understand the tree better, you must answer *m* queries of the preceding type.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=200000). The second line contains *n* integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=1000). Each of the next *n*\u20131 lines contains two integers *v**i* and *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*v**i*,<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*), meaning that there is an edge between nodes *v**i* and *u**i*.\n\nEach of the next *m* lines contains a query in the format described above.

In other words, for every *x*,<=*y* such that 1<=\u2264<=*x*,<=*y*<=\u2264<=*n* and *a**x*,<=*y*<=\u2260<=1, there should exist two indices *s* and *t* so that *a**x*,<=*y*<==<=*a**x*,<=*s*<=+<=*a**t*,<=*y*, where *a**i*,<=*j* denotes the integer in *i*-th row and *j*-th column.\n\nHelp Okabe determine whether a given lab is good!\nInput specification: The first line of input contains the integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the lab. \n\nThe next *n* lines contain *n* space-separated integers denoting a row of the grid. The *j*-th integer in the *i*-th row is *a**i*,<=*j* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=105).. Output specification: Print \"Yes\" if the given lab is good and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nYou can output each letter in upper or lower case.\nDemo input: ['3\\n1 1 2\\n2 3 1\\n6 4 1\\n', '3\\n1 5 2\\n1 1 1\\n1 2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n', 'No\\n']\nNote: In the first sample test, the 6 in the bottom left corner is valid because it is the sum of the 2 above it and the 4 on the right. The same holds for every number not equal to 1 in this table, so the answer is \"Yes\".\n\nIn the second sample test, the 5 cannot be formed as the sum of an integer in the same row and an integer in the same column.

Each description is a map of an *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* checkered rectangular field. Some cells of the field contain candies (each cell has at most one candy).

The levels can be transmitted in any order. There are two ways to transmit the current level *A*:\n 1.  You can transmit the whole level *A*. Then you need to transmit *n*\u00b7*m* bytes via the network. 1.  You can transmit the difference between level *A* and some previously transmitted level *B* (if it exists); this operation requires to transmit *d**A*,<=*B*\u00b7*w* bytes, where *d**A*,<=*B* is the number of cells of the field that are different for *A* and *B*, and *w* is a constant. Note, that you should compare only the corresponding cells of levels *A* and *B* to calculate *d**A*,<=*B*. You cannot transform the maps of levels, i.e. rotate or shift them relatively to each other. \nYour task is to find a way to transfer all the *k* levels and minimize the traffic.\nInput specification: The first line contains four integers *n*,<=*m*,<=*k*,<=*w* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=10;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*k*,<=*w*<=\u2264<=1000).

Pair *x**i*, *y**i* means that level *x**i* needs to be transferred by way *y**i*. If *y**i* equals 0, that means that the level must be transferred using the first way, otherwise *y**i* must be equal to the number of a previously transferred level.

Write a python script for the following problem: Vasya studies music. \n\nHe has learned lots of interesting stuff. For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\n\nVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads \u2014 major and minor.\n\nLet's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes *X*, *Y* and *Z*. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between *X* and *Y* equals 4 semitones and the distance between *Y* and *Z* is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between *X* and *Z*, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.\n\nA minor triad is different in that the distance between *X* and *Y* should be 3 semitones and between *Y* and *Z* \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nFor example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nHelp Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\nInput specification: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.. Output specification: Print \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\nDemo input: ['C E G\\n', 'C# B F\\n', 'A B H\\n'], Demo output: ['major\\n', 'minor\\n', 'strange\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

The grandmother has a large garden, which can be represented as a rectangle 1<=\u00d7<=*n* in size, when viewed from above. This rectangle is divided into *n* equal square sections. The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.\n\nCreating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section. At that, the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section. That is, for example, the garden can be represented by a 1<=\u00d7<=5 rectangle, where the section heights are equal to 4, 2, 3, 3, 2. Then if we create an artificial rain over any of the sections with the height of 3, the water will flow over all the sections, except the ones with the height of 4.

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes. The second line contains integers *x**c* and *y**c* \u2014 the initial square's coordinates (1<=\u2264<=*x**c*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y**c*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nThe third line contains an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the number of vectors. Then follow *k* lines, each of them contains two integers *dx**i* and *dy**i* (|*dx**i*|,<=|*dy**i*|<=\u2264<=109,<=|*dx*|<=+<=|*dy*|<=\u2265<=1).. Output specification: Print the single number \u2014 the number of steps Vasya had made.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.\nDemo input: ['4 5\\n1 1\\n3\\n1 1\\n1 1\\n0 -2\\n', '10 10\\n1 2\\n1\\n-1 0\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: In the first sample Vasya is initially positioned at square (1,\u20091) and makes 3 steps by the first vector (1,\u20091). So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091). He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

That's why Yakko, as the cleverest, came up with a truly genius idea: let each of the three roll an ordinary six-sided die, and the one with the highest amount of points will be the winner, and will take the other two to the place of his/her dreams.\n\nYakko thrown a die and got Y points, Wakko \u2014 W points. It was Dot's turn. But she didn't hurry. Dot wanted to know for sure what were her chances to visit Transylvania.\n\nIt is known that Yakko and Wakko are true gentlemen, that's why if they have the same amount of points with Dot, they will let Dot win.\nInput specification: The only line of the input file contains two natural numbers Y and W \u2014 the results of Yakko's and Wakko's die rolls.. Output specification: Output the required probability in the form of irreducible fraction in format \u00abA/B\u00bb, where A \u2014 the numerator, and B \u2014 the denominator. If the required probability equals to zero, output \u00ab0/1\u00bb. If the required probability equals to 1, output \u00ab1/1\u00bb.\nDemo input: ['4 2\\n'], Demo output: ['1/2\\n']\nNote: Dot will go to Transylvania, if she is lucky to roll 4, 5 or 6 points."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length *n* such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.\n\nOstap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly *k* cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if *k*<==<=1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if *k*<==<=2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.\n\nYour goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.\n\nThe second line contains a string of length *n* consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'.

Once the exam starts, Felix will get just a few seconds for all his attempts, and he can't learn the right answers so fast.\n\nThe robot will try to pass the exam in the following way. First, Felix fixes the answers for all questions. The result is a string of *n* bits: answers for the first, second, ..., *n*-th questions. In this string, 0 means that the answer is \"no\", and 1 is for \"yes\". Then he answers the questions according to this string, spending one attempt. After that, Felix can fix another string of *n* bits and make another attempt, and so on until there are no more attempts.\n\nIn the online system for exam, the following optimization is implemented: if at some moment of time, the examinee already got *k*<==<=2000 answers wrong, the attempt is immediately terminated with the corresponding message. For Felix, this means that the remaining bits in the string he fixed are ignored. If there were strictly less than *k* wrong answers for all *n* questions, the exam is considered passed.\n\nThe result of an attempt is a number from *k* to *n* inclusive: the number of questions after which the attempt was terminated. If the exam is passed, this number is considered to be *n*<=+<=1. The exam result is the highest result among all attempts. If there were no attempts, the exam result is zero.\n\nYour task is to write a program which will determine the bit strings for all attempts Felix makes. After each attempt, your program will get its result immediately. Help Felix get the highest exam result you can!\n\nInteraction Protocol\n\nYour solution can make from 0 to *x* attempts inclusive. To make an attempt, print a string to the standard output. The string must consist of exactly *n* binary digits without spaces and end with a newline character.\n\nTo prevent output buffering, after printing a string, insert a command to flush the buffer: for example, it can be fflush\u00a0(stdout) in C or C++, System.out.flush\u00a0() in Java, flush\u00a0(output) in Pascal or sys.stdout.flush\u00a0() in Python.\n\nAfter each attempt you make, you can immediately read its result from the standard input. The result is an integer from *k* to *n*<=+<=1 inclusive, followed by a newline character.\n\nScoring System\n\nA test is defined by a string of *n* binary digits: the right answers to *n* questions. This string is kept secret from the solution. Each test is evaluated separately.\n\nIf a solution followed the interaction protocol and terminated correctly on a test, it gets a score of *max* (0,<=*S*<=-<=4000) where *S* is the exam result. Otherwise, the solution gets zero score for the test.\n\nTesting\n\nYour solution will be checked on sets of tests generated in advance. Each test is created using a pseudo-random number generator. You can consider that the answers are uniformly distributed (the probabilities of digits 0 and 1 are the same) and mutually independent (the probabilities of all 2*n* possible strings are the same). A solution gets the score which is the sum of its score on all the tests.\n\nDuring the main phase of the contest, there are two ways to send a solution for checking.\n -  The first one is to check on examples. There are 10 example tests which are also available for local testing. As soon as the solution is checked, you can see reports for all examples by clicking on the submission result.-  The second way is to check on preliminary tests. There are 100 preliminary tests which are generated in advance but kept secret. The score for preliminary tests (but not for example tests) is used in the preliminary scoreboard. This score does not affect the final results, but nevertheless allows to roughly compare a solution with others. \nAfter the main phase ends, for each participant, the system chooses the final solution:\n -  consider all solutions sent for preliminary testing; -  choose the ones which got a total score strictly greater than zero; -  define the final solution as the one of chosen solutions which has the latest submission time. \nNote that the solutions sent only to be checked on examples are not considered when choosing the final solution.\n\nDuring the final testing, all final solutions will be checked on the same large set of a large number (<=\u2248<=1000) of final tests. The score for final tests determines the final scoreboard. The winner is the contestant whose solution gets the highest total score. In case two or more participants have equal total score, the contestants with such score tie for the same place.\n\nA package for local development is available on GitHub at the following address: [https://github.com/GassaFM/online-exam](https://github.com/GassaFM/online-exam). You can download sources or the latest release: [https://github.com/GassaFM/online-exam/releases](https://github.com/GassaFM/online-exam/releases).\n\nExample\n\nTo have an example which fits into the problem statement, let *n*<==<=10, *k*<==<=2, and *x*<==<=3 (recall that in the real problem, *n*<==<=5000, *k*<==<=2000, and *x*<==<=100, so this example is not a correct test for the problem). Let the right answers be defined by the string 1010001111. Before any attempts are made, the exam result is zero.\n\nConsider a solution making three attempts.\n\nLet the first attempt be defined by the string 0100100100. The result of this attempt is the number 2: the first wrong answer is the answer to the first question, and the second is to the second question. The exam result at this moment is 2.\n\nLet the second attempt be defined by the string 1010101010. The result of this attempt is the number 8: the first wrong answer is the answer to the fifth question, and the second is to the eighth question. The exam result at this moment is 8.\n\nLet the second attempt be defined by the string 1001011001. The result of this attempt is the number 4: the first wrong answer is the answer to the third question, and the second is to the fourth question. The exam result at this moment is still 8.\n\nAs *x*<==<=3 in our example, further attempts are impossible, so if the solution terminates correctly, the exam result is 8.\n\nNow consider another solution making two attempts.\n\nLet the first attempt be defined by the string 1010001110. Its result is the number 11: the first and only wrong answer is the answer to the tenth question, *k*<==<=2, so the exam is considered passed.\n\nLet the first attempt be defined by the string 0000011111. Its result is the number 3: the first wrong answer is the answer to the first question, and the second one is to the third question.\n\nIf the solution terminates correctly after the above two attempts, the exam result is 11.\nInput specification: none. Output specification: none\nDemo input: [], Demo output: []\nNote: none"}]}}

They are developing an algorithm for two bots playing a two-player game. The game is cooperative and turn based. In each turn, one of the players makes a move (it doesn\u2019t matter which player, it's possible that players turns do not alternate). \n\nAlgorithm for bots that Sasha and Ira are developing works by keeping track of the state the game is in. Each time either bot makes a move, the state changes. And, since the game is very dynamic, it will never go back to the state it was already in at any point in the past.\n\nSasha and Ira are perfectionists and want their algorithm to have an optimal winning strategy. They have noticed that in the optimal winning strategy, both bots make exactly *N* moves each. But, in order to find the optimal strategy, their algorithm needs to analyze all possible states of the game (they haven\u2019t learned about alpha-beta pruning yet) and pick the best sequence of moves.\n\nThey are worried about the efficiency of their algorithm and are wondering what is the total number of states of the game that need to be analyzed?\nInput specification: The first and only line contains integer N.\n -  1<=\u2264<=*N*<=\u2264<=106.

It can make moves when in state E, F and G, so states I, K and M are added to the list. Similarly, blue bot cannot make a move when in state G, but can when in D, E and F, so states H, J and L are added. -  Turn 4: Red bot already did N=2 moves when in states H, I and K, so it can only make moves when in J, L and M, so states P, R and S are added. Blue bot cannot make a move when in states J, L and M, but only when in H, I and K, so states N, O and Q are added. \nOverall, there are 19 possible states of the game their algorithm needs to analyze.\n\n<img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/3d9ef2ab59018319b986a58a65362116fa5be88d.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Little Artem has invented a time machine! He could go anywhere in time, but all his thoughts of course are with computer science. He wants to apply this time machine to a well-known data structure: multiset.\n\nArtem wants to create a basic multiset of integers. He wants these structure to support operations of three types:\n 1.  Add integer to the multiset. Note that the difference between set and multiset is that multiset may store several instances of one integer. 1.  Remove integer from the multiset. Only one instance of this integer is removed. Artem doesn't want to handle any exceptions, so he assumes that every time remove operation is called, that integer is presented in the multiset. 1.  Count the number of instances of the given integer that are stored in the multiset. \nBut what about time machine? Artem doesn't simply apply operations to the multiset one by one, he now travels to different moments of time and apply his operation there. Consider the following example.\n -  First Artem adds integer 5 to the multiset at the 1-st moment of time. -  Then Artem adds integer 3 to the multiset at the moment 5. -  Then Artem asks how many 5 are there in the multiset at moment 6. The answer is 1. -  Then Artem returns back in time and asks how many integers 3 are there in the set at moment 4. Since 3 was added only at moment 5, the number of integers 3 at moment 4 equals to 0. -  Then Artem goes back in time again and removes 5 from the multiset at moment 3. -  Finally Artyom asks at moment 7 how many integers 5 are there in the set. The result is 0, since we have removed 5 at the moment 3. \nNote that Artem dislikes exceptions so much that he assures that after each change he makes all delete operations are applied only to element that is present in the multiset. The answer to the query of the third type is computed at the moment Artem makes the corresponding query and are not affected in any way by future changes he makes.\n\nHelp Artem implement time travellers multiset.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of Artem's queries.\n\nThen follow *n* lines with queries descriptions.

Let's enumerate players from both teams by integers from 1 to 4. The first and second player play in the first team, the third and the fourth one play in the second team. For each of the four players we know their game skills in defence and attack. The defence skill of the *i*-th player is *a**i*, the attack skill is *b**i*.\n\nBefore the game, the teams determine how they will play. First the players of the first team decide who will play in the attack, and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do the same, based on the choice of their opponents.\n\nWe will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.\n\nThe teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally.

Write a python script for the following problem: Once upon a time, when the world was more beautiful, the sun shone brighter, the grass was greener and the sausages tasted better Arlandia was the most powerful country. And its capital was the place where our hero DravDe worked. He couldn\u2019t program or make up problems (in fact, few people saw a computer those days) but he was nevertheless happy. He worked in a warehouse where a magical but non-alcoholic drink Ogudar-Olok was kept. We won\u2019t describe his work in detail and take a better look at a simplified version of the warehouse.\n\nThe warehouse has one set of shelving. It has *n* shelves, each of which is divided into *m* sections. The shelves are numbered from top to bottom starting from 1 and the sections of each shelf are numbered from left to right also starting from 1. Each section can contain exactly one box of the drink, and try as he might, DravDe can never put a box in a section that already has one. In the course of his work DravDe frequently notices that he has to put a box in a filled section. In that case his solution is simple. DravDe ignores that section and looks at the next one to the right. If it is empty, he puts the box there. Otherwise he keeps looking for the first empty section to the right. If no empty section is found by the end of the shelf, he looks at the shelf which is under it, then the next one, etc. Also each time he looks at a new shelf he starts from the shelf\u2019s beginning. If DravDe still can\u2019t find an empty section for the box, he immediately drinks it all up and throws the empty bottles away not to be caught.\n\nAfter one great party with a lot of Ogudar-Olok drunk DravDe asked you to help him. Unlike him, you can program and therefore modeling the process of counting the boxes in the warehouse will be easy work for you.\n\nThe process of counting contains two types of query messages: \n -  \u00ab+1 x y id\u00bb (where *x*, *y* are integers, 1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*, 1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*, and *id* is a string of lower case Latin letters \u2014 from 1 to 10 characters long). That query means that the warehouse got a box identified as *id*, which should be put in the section *y* on the shelf *x*. If the section is full, use the rules described above. It is guaranteed that every moment of the process the identifiers of all the boxes in the warehouse are different. You don\u2019t have to answer this query. -  \u00ab-1 id\u00bb (where *id* is a string of lower case Latin letters \u2014 from 1 to 10 characters long). That query means that a box identified as *id* is removed from the warehouse. You have to answer this query (see output format).\nInput specification: The first input line contains integers *n*, *m* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=30, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=2000) \u2014 the height, the width of shelving and the amount of the operations in the warehouse that you need to analyze. In the following *k* lines the queries are given in the order of appearance in the format described above.. Output specification: For each query of the \u00ab-1 id\u00bb type output two numbers in a separate line \u2014 index of the shelf and index of the section where the box with this identifier lay. If there was no such box in the warehouse when the query was made, output \u00ab-1 -1\u00bb without quotes.\nDemo input: ['2 2 9\\n+1 1 1 cola\\n+1 1 1 fanta\\n+1 1 1 sevenup\\n+1 1 1 whitekey\\n-1 cola\\n-1 fanta\\n-1 sevenup\\n-1 whitekey\\n-1 cola\\n', '2 2 8\\n+1 1 1 cola\\n-1 cola\\n+1 1 1 fanta\\n-1 fanta\\n+1 1 1 sevenup\\n-1 sevenup\\n+1 1 1 whitekey\\n-1 whitekey\\n'], Demo output: ['1 1\\n1 2\\n2 1\\n2 2\\n-1 -1\\n', '1 1\\n1 1\\n1 1\\n1 1\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.\n\nOne day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest.

In a table below you can see a better form of the provided example of the communication process.\n\n<img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/ea790051c34ea7d2761cd9b096412ca7c647a173.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\nThe hidden number is divisible by both 2 and 5. Thus, it must be composite. Note that it isn't necessary to know the exact value of the hidden number. In this test, the hidden number is 30.\n\n<img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/35c6952617fa94ec3e0ea8e63aa1c3c49b3ba420.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\n59 is a divisor of the hidden number. In the interval [2,\u2009100] there is only one number with this divisor. The hidden number must be 59, which is prime. Note that the answer is known even after the second query and you could print it then and terminate. Though, it isn't forbidden to ask unnecessary queries (unless you exceed the limit of 20 queries)."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Vadim is really keen on travelling. Recently he heard about kayaking activity near his town and became very excited about it, so he joined a party of kayakers.\n\nNow the party is ready to start its journey, but firstly they have to choose kayaks. There are 2\u00b7*n* people in the group (including Vadim), and they have exactly *n*<=-<=1 tandem kayaks (each of which, obviously, can carry two people) and 2 single kayaks. *i*-th person's weight is *w**i*, and weight is an important matter in kayaking \u2014 if the difference between the weights of two people that sit in the same tandem kayak is too large, then it can crash. And, of course, people want to distribute their seats in kayaks in order to minimize the chances that kayaks will crash.\n\nFormally, the instability of a single kayak is always 0, and the instability of a tandem kayak is the absolute difference between weights of the people that are in this kayak. Instability of the whole journey is the total instability of all kayaks.\n\nHelp the party to determine minimum possible total instability!\nInput specification: The first line contains one number *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50).\n\nThe second line contains 2\u00b7*n* integer numbers *w*1, *w*2, ..., *w*2*n*, where *w**i* is weight of person *i* (1<=\u2264<=*w**i*<=\u2264<=1000)..

Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!).

First, he asks you to tell him a positive integer *X*\u00a0\u2014 the required total volume of the tower. Then, Limak adds new blocks greedily, one by one. Each time he adds the biggest block such that the total volume doesn't exceed *X*.\n\nLimak asks you to choose *X* not greater than *m*.

The armies of flatlanders stand on the borders of circles, the circles' centers are in the surrounded cities. At any moment all points of the flatland ring can begin to move quickly in the direction of the city \u2014 that's the strategy the flatlanders usually follow when they besiege cities.\n\nThe berlanders are sure that they can repel the enemy's attack if they learn the exact time the attack starts. For that they need to construct a radar that would register any movement at the distance of at most *r* from it. Thus, we can install a radar at such point, that at least one point of the enemy ring will be in its detecting range (that is, at a distance of at most *r*). Then the radar can immediately inform about the enemy's attack. \n\nDue to the newest technologies, we can place a radar at any point without any problems. But the problem is that the berlanders have the time to make only one radar. Besides, the larger the detection radius (*r*) is, the more the radar costs.\n\nThat's why Vasya's task (that is, your task) is to find the minimum possible detection radius for the radar. In other words, your task is to find the minimum radius *r* (*r*<=\u2265<=0) such, that a radar with radius *r* can be installed at some point and it can register the start of the movements of both flatland rings from that point. \n\nIn this problem you can consider the cities as material points, the attacking enemy rings - as circles with centers in the cities, the radar's detection range \u2014 as a disk (including the border) with the center at the point where the radar is placed.\nInput specification: The input files consist of two lines.

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$..

Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$."}]}}

You should put *k* ones in it in such a way that the resulting matrix is symmetrical with respect to the main diagonal (the diagonal that goes from the top left to the bottom right corner) and is lexicographically maximal.\n\nOne matrix is lexicographically greater than the other if the first different number in the first different row from the top in the first matrix is greater than the corresponding number in the second one.\n\nIf there exists no such matrix then output -1.\nInput specification: The first line consists of two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100, 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=106).. Output specification: If the answer exists then output resulting matrix. Otherwise output -1.\nDemo input: ['2 1\\n', '3 2\\n', '2 5\\n'], Demo output: ['1 0 \\n0 0 \\n', '1 0 0 \\n0 1 0 \\n0 0 0 \\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}
