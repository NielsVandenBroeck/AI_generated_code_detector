The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.\nInput specification: There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number. It is guaranteed that the numbers are made from 0 and 1 only and that their length is same. The numbers may start with 0. The length of each number doesn't exceed 100.. Output specification: Write one line \u2014 the corresponding answer. Do not omit the leading 0s.\nDemo input: ['1010100\\n0100101\\n', '000\\n111\\n', '1110\\n1010\\n', '01110\\n01100\\n'], Demo output: ['1110001\\n', '111\\n', '0100\\n', '00010\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

A network topology is the way of describing the network configuration, the scheme that shows the location and the connections of network devices.\n\nPolycarpus knows three main network topologies: bus, ring and star. A bus is the topology that represents a shared cable with all computers connected with it. In the ring topology the cable connects each computer only with two other ones. A star is the topology where all computers of a network are connected to the single central node.\n\nLet's represent each of these network topologies as a connected non-directed graph. A bus is a connected graph that is the only path, that is, the graph where all nodes are connected with two other ones except for some two nodes that are the beginning and the end of the path. A ring is a connected graph, where all nodes are connected with two other ones. A star is a connected graph, where a single central node is singled out and connected with all other nodes. For clarifications, see the picture.\n\nYou've got a connected non-directed graph that characterizes the computer network in Polycarpus' corporation.

The computer network of this corporation consists of *n* computers, some of them are connected by a cable. The computers are indexed by integers from 1 to *n*. It's known that any two computers connected by cable directly or through other computers\n\nPolycarpus decided to find out the network's topology. A network topology is the way of describing the network configuration, the scheme that shows the location and the connections of network devices.\n\nPolycarpus knows three main network topologies: bus, ring and star. A bus is the topology that represents a shared cable with all computers connected with it. In the ring topology the cable connects each computer only with two other ones. A star is the topology where all computers of a network are connected to the single central node.\n\nLet's represent each of these network topologies as a connected non-directed graph. A bus is a connected graph that is the only path, that is, the graph where all nodes are connected with two other ones except for some two nodes that are the beginning and the end of the path. A ring is a connected graph, where all nodes are connected with two other ones. A star is a connected graph, where a single central node is singled out and connected with all other nodes. For clarifications, see the picture.\n\nYou've got a connected non-directed graph that characterizes the computer network in Polycarpus' corporation.

However, the child is so naughty that he can't wait to destroy the toy.\n\nThe toy consists of *n* parts and *m* ropes. Each rope links two parts, but every pair of parts is linked by at most one rope. To split the toy, the child must remove all its parts. The child can remove a single part at a time, and each remove consume an energy. Let's define an energy value of part *i* as *v**i*. The child spend *v**f*1<=+<=*v**f*2<=+<=...<=+<=*v**f**k* energy for removing part *i* where *f*1,<=*f*2,<=...,<=*f**k* are the parts that are directly connected to the *i*-th and haven't been removed.\n\nHelp the child to find out, what is the minimum total energy he should spend to remove all *n* parts.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000; 0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=2000). The second line contains *n* integers: *v*1,<=*v*2,<=...,<=*v**n* (0<=\u2264<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=105). Then followed *m* lines, each line contains two integers *x**i* and *y**i*, representing a rope from part *x**i* to part *y**i* (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=*n*;\u00a0*x**i*<=\u2260<=*y**i*).\n\nConsider all the parts are numbered from 1 to *n*..

Here is a simplified description of the scheme. \n\nThree distinct states *i*, *j* and *k* are selected, where *i*<=&lt;<=*j*<=&lt;<=*k*. After that the following process happens: \n 1.  initially the atom is in the state *i*,1.  we spend *E**k*<=-<=*E**i* energy to put the atom in the state *k*,1.  the atom emits a photon with useful energy *E**k*<=-<=*E**j* and changes its state to the state *j*,1.  the atom spontaneously changes its state to the state *i*, losing energy *E**j*<=-<=*E**i*,1.  the process repeats from step 1. \nLet's define the energy conversion efficiency as , i.\u00a0e. the ration between the useful energy of the photon and spent energy.\n\nDue to some limitations, Arkady can only choose such three states that *E**k*<=-<=*E**i*<=\u2264<=*U*.\n\nHelp Arkady to find such the maximum possible energy conversion efficiency within the above constraints.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *U* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 1<=\u2264<=*U*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the number of states and the maximum possible difference between *E**k* and *E**i*.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers *E*1,<=*E*2,<=...,<=*E**n* (1<=\u2264<=*E*1<=&lt;<=*E*2...<=&lt;<=*E**n*<=\u2264<=109).

And the indexes in the big array are {2, 3, 1, 3}. So the actual values in the big array after formatting it as concatenation of the small arrays will be {3, 3, -5, 1, 1, 6, -2, -5, 1}. In this example the maximum sum is 9.\n\nCan you help Mostafa solve this problem?\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m*, *n* is the number of the small arrays (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50), and *m* is the number of indexes in the big array (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=250000). Then follow *n* lines, the *i*-th line starts with one integer *l* which is the size of the *i*-th array (1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=5000), followed by *l* integers each one will be greater than or equal -1000 and less than or equal 1000. The last line contains *m* integers which are the indexes in the big array, and you should concatenate the small arrays in the same order, and each index will be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to *n*.\n\nThe small arrays are numbered from 1 to *n* in the same order as given in the input. Some of the given small arrays may not be used in big array.\n\nNote, that the array is very big. So if you try to build it straightforwardly, you will probably get time or/and memory limit exceeded.. Output specification: Print one line containing the maximum sum in the big array after formatting it as described above. You must choose at least one element for the sum, i. e. it cannot be empty.\n\nPlease, do not use %lld specificator to write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use cout (also you may use %I64d).\nDemo input: ['3 4\\n3 1 6 -2\\n2 3 3\\n2 -5 1\\n2 3 1 3\\n', '6 1\\n4 0 8 -3 -10\\n8 3 -2 -5 10 8 -9 -5 -4\\n1 0\\n1 -3\\n3 -8 5 6\\n2 9 6\\n1\\n'], Demo output: ['9\\n', '8\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Grigoriy, like the hero of one famous comedy film, found a job as a night security guard at the museum. At first night he received embosser and was to take stock of the whole exposition.\n\nEmbosser is a special devise that allows to \"print\" the text of a plastic tape. Text is printed sequentially, character by character. The device consists of a wheel with a lowercase English letters written in a circle, static pointer to the current letter and a button that print the chosen letter. At one move it's allowed to rotate the alphabetic wheel one step clockwise or counterclockwise. Initially, static pointer points to letter 'a'. Other letters are located as shown on the picture:\n\nAfter Grigoriy add new item to the base he has to print its name on the plastic tape and attach it to the corresponding exhibit. It's not required to return the wheel to its initial position with pointer on the letter 'a'.\n\nOur hero is afraid that some exhibits may become alive and start to attack him, so he wants to print the names as fast as possible. Help him, for the given string find the minimum number of rotations of the wheel required to print it.\nInput specification: The only line of input contains the name of some exhibit\u00a0\u2014 the non-empty string consisting of no more than 100 characters.

Write a python script for the following problem: This problem uses a simplified network topology model, please read the problem statement carefully and use it as a formal document as you develop the solution.\n\nPolycarpus continues working as a system administrator in a large corporation. The computer network of this corporation consists of *n* computers, some of them are connected by a cable. The computers are indexed by integers from 1 to *n*. It's known that any two computers connected by cable directly or through other computers\n\nPolycarpus decided to find out the network's topology. A network topology is the way of describing the network configuration, the scheme that shows the location and the connections of network devices.\n\nPolycarpus knows three main network topologies: bus, ring and star. A bus is the topology that represents a shared cable with all computers connected with it. In the ring topology the cable connects each computer only with two other ones. A star is the topology where all computers of a network are connected to the single central node.\n\nLet's represent each of these network topologies as a connected non-directed graph. A bus is a connected graph that is the only path, that is, the graph where all nodes are connected with two other ones except for some two nodes that are the beginning and the end of the path. A ring is a connected graph, where all nodes are connected with two other ones. A star is a connected graph, where a single central node is singled out and connected with all other nodes. For clarifications, see the picture.\n\nYou've got a connected non-directed graph that characterizes the computer network in Polycarpus' corporation. Help him find out, which topology type the given network is. If that is impossible to do, say that the network's topology is unknown.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (4<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105;\u00a03<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of nodes and edges in the graph, correspondingly.

There is at most one edge between any two nodes. No edge connects a node with itself.. Output specification: In a single line print the network topology name of the given graph.

All Berland roads are bidirectional. As there are many fools in Berland, between each pair of cities there is a path (or else the fools would get upset). Also, between each pair of cities there is no more than one simple path (or else the fools would get lost). \n\nBut that is not the end of Berland's special features. In this country fools sometimes visit each other and thus spoil the roads. The fools aren't very smart, so they always use only the simple paths.\n\nA simple path is the path which goes through every Berland city not more than once.\n\nThe Berland government knows the paths which the fools use. Help the government count for each road, how many distinct fools can go on it.\n\nNote how the fools' paths are given in the input.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of cities. \n\nEach of the next *n*<=-<=1 lines contains two space-separated integers *u**i*,<=*v**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, *u**i*<=\u2260<=*v**i*), that means that there is a road connecting cities *u**i* and *v**i*. \n\nThe next line contains integer *k* (0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of pairs of fools who visit each other. \n\nNext *k* lines contain two space-separated numbers. The *i*-th line (*i*<=&gt;<=0) contains numbers *a**i*,<=*b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*). That means that the fool number 2*i*<=-<=1 lives in city *a**i* and visits the fool number 2*i*, who lives in city *b**i*. The given pairs describe simple paths, because between every pair of cities there is only one simple path.. Output specification: Print *n*<=-<=1 integer. The integers should be separated by spaces. The *i*-th number should equal the number of fools who can go on the *i*-th road. The roads are numbered starting from one in the order, in which they occur in the input.\nDemo input: ['5\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n2 4\\n2 5\\n2\\n1 4\\n3 5\\n', '5\\n3 4\\n4 5\\n1 4\\n2 4\\n3\\n2 3\\n1 3\\n3 5\\n'], Demo output: ['2 1 1 1 \\n', '3 1 1 1 \\n']\nNote: In the first sample the fool number one goes on the first and third road and the fool number 3 goes on the second, first and fourth ones.\n\nIn the second sample, the fools number 1, 3 and 5 go on the first road, the fool number 5 will go on the second road, on the third road goes the fool number 3, and on the fourth one goes fool number 1."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective. You are able to cope with it not worse, aren't you?\nInput specification: The first and single line contains two integers *A* and *B* (1<=\u2264<=*A*,<=*B*<=\u2264<=109,<=*min*(*A*,<=*B*)<=\u2264<=12)..

The organizers of some event want to choose a place to accommodate the participants (junction *v*), and the place to set up the contests (junction *u*). Besides, at the one hand, they want the participants to walk about the city and see the neighbourhood (that's why the distance between *v* and *u* should be no less than *l*). On the other hand, they don't want the participants to freeze (so the distance between *v* and *u* should be no more than *r*). Besides, for every street we know its beauty \u2014 some integer from 0 to 109. Your task is to choose the path that fits in the length limits and has the largest average beauty. We shall define the average beauty as a median of sequence of the beauties of all roads along the path.\n\nWe can put it more formally like that: let there be a path with the length *k*. Let *a**i* be a non-decreasing sequence that contains exactly *k* elements. Each number occurs there exactly the number of times a road with such beauty occurs along on path. We will represent the path median as number *a*\u230a*k*<=/<=2\u230b, assuming that indexation starting from zero is used. \u230a*x*\u230b \u2014 is number *\u0445*, rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\nFor example, if *a*<==<={0,<=5,<=12}, then the median equals to 5, and if *a*<==<={0,<=5,<=7,<=12}, then the median is number 7.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there will be at least one path with the suitable quantity of roads.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *l*, *r* (1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=*r*<=&lt;<=*n*<=\u2264<=105).\n\nNext *n*<=-<=1 lines contain descriptions of roads of the Nvodsk, each line contains three integers *a**i*, *b**i*, *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, 0<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=109, *a**i*<=\u2260<=*b**i*) \u2014 junctions *a**i* and *b**i* are connected with a street whose beauty equals *c**i*..

Vasya-8800 is an economy-class android which is produced by a little-known company. His design is not perfect, his characteristics also could be better. So he is bullied by other androids.\n\nOne of the popular pranks on Vasya is to force him to compare $x^y$ with $y^x$. Other androids can do it in milliseconds while Vasya's memory is too small to store such big numbers.\n\nPlease help Vasya!

For every integer *i* where 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1 the condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* holds. Next, he made *n*<=-<=1 portals, numbered by integers from 1 to *n*<=-<=1. The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) portal connects cell *i* and cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*), and one can travel from cell *i* to cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) using the *i*-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) to cell *i* using the *i*-th portal. It is easy to see that because of condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* one can't leave the Line World using portals.\n\nCurrently, I am standing at cell 1, and I want to go to cell *t*. However, I don't know whether it is possible to go there. Please determine whether I can go to cell *t* by only using the construted transportation system.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3<=\u00d7<=104) and *t* (2<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of cells, and the index of the cell which I want to go to.\n\nThe second line contains *n*<=-<=1 space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1 (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i*). It is guaranteed, that using the given transportation system, one cannot leave the Line World.. Output specification: If I can go to cell *t* using the transportation system, print \"YES\". Otherwise, print \"NO\".\nDemo input: ['8 4\\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1\\n', '8 5\\n1 2 1 2 1 1 1\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, the visited cells are: 1,\u20092,\u20094; so we can successfully visit the cell 4.\n\nIn the second sample, the possible cells to visit are: 1,\u20092,\u20094,\u20096,\u20097,\u20098; so we can't visit the cell 5, which we want to visit."}]}}

For statement consists of a header written in a separate line which starts with \"for\" prefix, and loop body. Loop body is a block of statements indented one level further than the header of the loop. Loop body can contain both types of statements. Loop body can't be empty.\n\nYou are given a sequence of statements without indentation. Find the number of ways in which the statements can be indented to form a valid Python program.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *N* (1<=\u2264<=*N*<=\u2264<=5000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of commands in the program. *N* lines of the program follow, each line describing a single command. Each command is either \"f\" (denoting \"for statement\") or \"s\" (\"simple statement\"). It is guaranteed that the last line is a simple statement.. Output specification: Output one line containing an integer - the number of ways the given sequence of statements can be indented modulo 109<=+<=7.\nDemo input: ['4\\ns\\nf\\nf\\ns\\n', '4\\nf\\ns\\nf\\ns\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: In the first test case, there is only one way to indent the program: the second for statement must be part of the body of the first one.\n\nIn the second test case, there are two ways to indent the program: the second for statement can either be part of the first one's body or a separate statement following the first one.\n\nor"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Petya loves computer games. Finally a game that he's been waiting for so long came out!\n\nThe main character of this game has *n* different skills, each of which is characterized by an integer *a**i* from 0 to 100. The higher the number *a**i* is, the higher is the *i*-th skill of the character. The total rating of the character is calculated as the sum of the values \u200b\u200bof  for all *i* from 1 to *n*. The expression \u230a *x*\u230b denotes the result of rounding the number *x* down to the nearest integer.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Petya got *k* improvement units as a bonus that he can use to increase the skills of his character and his total rating. One improvement unit can increase any skill of Petya's character by exactly one. For example, if *a*4<==<=46, after using one imporvement unit to this skill, it becomes equal to 47. A hero's skill cannot rise higher more than 100. Thus, it is permissible that some of the units will remain unused.\n\nYour task is to determine the optimal way of using the improvement units so as to maximize the overall rating of the character. It is not necessary to use all the improvement units.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two positive integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=107) \u2014 the number of skills of the character and the number of units of improvements at Petya's disposal.\n\nThe second line of the input contains a sequence of *n* integers *a**i* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100), where *a**i* characterizes the level of the *i*-th skill of the character.. Output specification: The first line of the output should contain a single non-negative integer \u2014 the maximum total rating of the character that Petya can get using *k* or less improvement units.\nDemo input: ['2 4\\n7 9\\n', '3 8\\n17 15 19\\n', '2 2\\n99 100\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '5\\n', '20\\n']\nNote: In the first test case the optimal strategy is as follows. Petya has to improve the first skill to 10 by spending 3 improvement units, and the second skill to 10, by spending one improvement unit. Thus, Petya spends all his improvement units and the total rating of the character becomes equal to  *lfloor* *frac*{100}{10} *rfloor*\u2009+\u2009 *lfloor* *frac*{100}{10} *rfloor*\u2009=\u200910\u2009+\u200910\u2009=\u2009 20.\n\nIn the second test the optimal strategy for Petya is to improve the first skill to 20 (by spending 3 improvement units) and to improve the third skill to 20 (in this case by spending 1 improvement units). Thus, Petya is left with 4 improvement units and he will be able to increase the second skill to 19 (which does not change the overall rating, so Petya does not necessarily have to do it). Therefore, the highest possible total rating in this example is <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/ccaa4e1e435ea3a339c322e03a32de69d214a257.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>.\n\nIn the third test case the optimal strategy for Petya is to increase the first skill to 100 by spending 1 improvement unit. Thereafter, both skills of the character will be equal to 100, so Petya will not be able to spend the remaining improvement unit. So the answer is equal to <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/b246630ca7d1b95b91970759bd8455cb3e930bf9.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>."}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Alice wants to send an important message to Bob. Message *a*<==<=(*a*1,<=...,<=*a**n*) is a sequence of positive integers (characters).\n\nTo compress the message Alice wants to use binary Huffman coding. We recall that binary Huffman code, or binary prefix code is a function *f*, that maps each letter that appears in the string to some binary string (that is, string consisting of characters '0' and '1' only) such that for each pair of different characters *a**i* and *a**j* string *f*(*a**i*) is not a prefix of *f*(*a**j*) (and vice versa). The result of the encoding of the message *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* is the concatenation of the encoding of each character, that is the string *f*(*a*1)*f*(*a*2)... *f*(*a**n*). Huffman codes are very useful, as the compressed message can be easily and uniquely decompressed, if the function *f* is given. Code is usually chosen in order to minimize the total length of the compressed message, i.e. the length of the string *f*(*a*1)*f*(*a*2)... *f*(*a**n*).\n\nBecause of security issues Alice doesn't want to send the whole message. Instead, she picks some substrings of the message and wants to send them separately. For each of the given substrings *a**l**i*... *a**r**i* she wants to know the minimum possible length of the Huffman coding. Help her solve this problem.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains the single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the initial message.

Positions are numbered from 1. Substrings may overlap in any way. The same substring may appear in the input more than once.. Output specification: Print *q* lines.

If you teach him a subject, then time required to teach any chapter of the next subject will require exactly 1 hour less than previously required (see the examples to understand it more clearly). Note that his per chapter learning power can not be less than 1 hour.\n\nYou can teach him the *n* subjects in any possible order.

Consider the order of subjects: 1, 2. When you teach Devu the first subject, it will take him 3 hours per chapter, so it will take 12 hours to teach first subject. After teaching first subject, his per chapter learning time will be 2 hours. Now teaching him second subject will take 2\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009=\u20092 hours. Hence you will need to spend 12\u2009+\u20092\u2009=\u200914 hours.\n\nConsider the order of subjects: 2, 1. When you teach Devu the second subject, then it will take him 3 hours per chapter, so it will take 3\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009=\u20093 hours to teach the second subject.

When you teach Devu the first subject, it will take him 3 hours per chapter. When you teach Devu the second subject, it will take him 2 hours per chapter. When you teach Devu the third subject, it will take him 1 hours per chapter. In total it takes 6 hours."}]}}

He already has a rectangular *w* mm <=\u00d7<= *h* mm sheet of glass, a diamond glass cutter and lots of enthusiasm. What he lacks is understanding of what to carve and how.\n\nIn order not to waste time, he decided to practice the technique of carving. To do this, he makes vertical and horizontal cuts through the entire sheet. This process results in making smaller rectangular fragments of glass. Leonid does not move the newly made glass fragments. In particular, a cut divides each fragment of glass that it goes through into smaller fragments.\n\nAfter each cut Leonid tries to determine what area the largest of the currently available glass fragments has. Since there appear more and more fragments, this question takes him more and more time and distracts him from the fascinating process.\n\nLeonid offers to divide the labor \u2014 he will cut glass, and you will calculate the area of the maximum fragment after each cut.

Vasya-8800 is an economy-class android which is produced by a little-known company. His design is not perfect, his characteristics also could be better. So he is bullied by other androids.\n\nOne of the popular pranks on Vasya is to force him to compare $x^y$ with $y^x$.

The round was 120 minutes long and featured five problems with maximum point values of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500, respectively. Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.\n\nCodeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is *x*, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute *m* but made *w* wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is . His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.\n\nAll arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains five space-separated integers *m*1, *m*2, *m*3, *m*4, *m*5, where *m**i* (0<=\u2264<=*m**i*<=\u2264<=119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem *i*. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted.\n\nThe second line contains five space-separated integers *w*1, *w*2, *w*3, *w*4, *w*5, where *w**i* (0<=\u2264<=*w**i*<=\u2264<=10) is Kevin's number of wrong submissions on problem *i*.\n\nThe last line contains two space-separated integers *h**s* and *h**u* (0<=\u2264<=*h**s*,<=*h**u*<=\u2264<=20), denoting the Kevin's numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively..

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes. The second line contains integers *x**c* and *y**c* \u2014 the initial square's coordinates (1<=\u2264<=*x**c*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y**c*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nThe third line contains an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the number of vectors. Then follow *k* lines, each of them contains two integers *dx**i* and *dy**i* (|*dx**i*|,<=|*dy**i*|<=\u2264<=109,<=|*dx*|<=+<=|*dy*|<=\u2265<=1).. Output specification: Print the single number \u2014 the number of steps Vasya had made.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++.

So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091). He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: After the big birthday party, Katie still wanted Shiro to have some more fun. Later, she came up with a game called treasure hunt. Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\n\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.. Output specification: Print the name of the winner (\"Kuro\", \"Shiro\" or \"Katie\"). If there are at least two cats that share the maximum beauty, print \"Draw\".\nDemo input: ['3\\nKuroo\\nShiro\\nKatie\\n', '7\\ntreasurehunt\\nthreefriends\\nhiCodeforces\\n', '1\\nabcabc\\ncbabac\\nababca\\n', '15\\nfoPaErcvJ\\nmZaxowpbt\\nmkuOlaHRE\\n'], Demo output: ['Kuro\\n', 'Shiro\\n', 'Katie\\n', 'Draw\\n']\nNote: In the first example, after $3$ turns, Kuro can change his ribbon into ooooo, which has the beauty of $5$, while reaching such beauty for Shiro and Katie is impossible (both Shiro and Katie can reach the beauty of at most $4$, for example by changing Shiro's ribbon into SSiSS and changing Katie's ribbon into Kaaaa). Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice. Therefore, the game ends in a draw."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$..

Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$."}]}}

He's been working there for a long time and is satisfied with his job, as it allows him to eat out in the best restaurants and order the most expensive and exotic wood types there. \n\nThe content special agent has got an important task: to get the latest research by British scientists on the English Language. These developments are encoded and stored in a large safe. The Beaver's teeth are strong enough, so the authorities assured that upon arriving at the place the beaver won't have any problems with opening the safe.\n\nAnd he finishes his aspen sprig and leaves for this important task. Of course, the Beaver arrived at the location without any problems, but alas. He can't open the safe with his strong and big teeth. At this point, the Smart Beaver get a call from the headquarters and learns that opening the safe with the teeth is not necessary, as a reliable source has sent the following information: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. There also is a special hint, which can be used to open the safe. The hint is string *s* with the following structure:\n -  if *s**i* = \"?\", then the digit that goes *i*-th in the safe code can be anything (between 0 to 9, inclusively); -  if *s**i* is a digit (between 0 to 9, inclusively), then it means that there is digit *s**i* on position *i* in code; -  if the string contains letters from \"A\" to \"J\", then all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits and the positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits. -  The length of the safe code coincides with the length of the hint. \nFor example, hint \"?JGJ9\" has such matching safe code variants: \"51919\", \"55959\", \"12329\", \"93539\" and so on, and has wrong variants such as: \"56669\", \"00111\", \"03539\" and \"13666\".\n\nAfter receiving such information, the authorities change the plan and ask the special agents to work quietly and gently and not to try to open the safe by mechanical means, and try to find the password using the given hint.\n\nAt a special agent school the Smart Beaver was the fastest in his platoon finding codes for such safes, but now he is not in that shape: the years take their toll ... Help him to determine the number of possible variants of the code to the safe, matching the given hint.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: This problem is a little bit unusual. Here you are to implement an interaction with a testing system. That means that you can make queries and get responses in the online mode. Please be sure to use the stream flushing operation after each query's output in order not to leave part of your output in some buffer. For example, in C++ you've got to use the fflush(stdout) function, in Java \u2014 call System.out.flush(), and in Pascal \u2014 flush(output).\n\nBulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls or Bulls and Cleots) is an old code-breaking paper and pencil game for two players, predating the similar commercially marketed board game Mastermind.\n\nOn a sheet of paper, the first player thinks a secret string. This string consists only of digits and has the length 4. The digits in the string must be all different, no two or more equal digits are allowed.\n\nThen the second player tries to guess his opponent's string. For every guess the first player gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are on their right positions, they are \"bulls\", if on different positions, they are \"cows\". Thus a response is a pair of numbers \u2014 the number of \"bulls\" and the number of \"cows\". A try can contain equal digits.\n\nMore formally, let's the secret string is *s* and the second player are trying to guess it with a string *x*. The number of \"bulls\" is a number of such positions *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=4) where *s*[*i*]<==<=*x*[*i*]. The number of \"cows\" is a number of such digits *c* that *s* contains *c* in the position *i* (i.e. *s*[*i*]<==<=*c*), *x* contains *c*, but *x*[*i*]<=\u2260<=*c*.\n\nFor example, the secret string is \"0427\", the opponent's try is \"0724\", then the answer is 2 bulls and 2 cows (the bulls are \"0\" and \"2\", the cows are \"4\" and \"7\"). If the secret string is \"0123\", the opponent's try is \"0330\", then the answer is 1 bull and 1 cow.\n\nIn this problem you are to guess the string *s* that the system has chosen. You only know that the chosen string consists of 4 distinct digits.\n\nYou can make queries to the testing system, each query is the output of a single 4-digit string. The answer to the query is the number of bulls and number of cows. If the system's response equals \"4 0\", that means the interaction with your problem is over and the program must terminate. That is possible for two reasons \u2014 the program either guessed the number *x* or made an invalid action (for example, printed letters instead of digits).\n\nYour program is allowed to do at most 50 queries.\n\nYou can hack solutions of other participants providing a 4-digit string containing distinct digits \u2014 the secret string.\nInput specification: To read answers to the queries, the program must use the standard input.\n\nThe program will receive pairs of non-negative integers in the input, one pair per line. The first number in a pair is a number of bulls and the second one is a number of cows of the string *s* and the string *x**i* printed by your program. If the system response equals \"4 0\", then your solution should terminate.\n\nThe testing system will let your program read the *i*-th pair of integers from the input only after your program displays the corresponding system query in the output: prints value *x**i* in a single line and executes operation flush.. Output specification: The program must use the standard output to print queries.\n\nYour program must output requests \u2014 4-digit strings *x*1,<=*x*2,<=..., one per line. After the output of each line the program must execute flush operation. The program should read the answer to the query from the standard input.\n\nYour program is allowed to do at most 50 queries.\nDemo input: ['0 1\\n2 0\\n1 1\\n0 4\\n2 1\\n4 0\\n'], Demo output: ['8000\\n0179\\n3159\\n3210\\n0112\\n0123']\nNote: The secret string *s* in the example is \"0123\"."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Imagine that you have a twin brother or sister. Having another person that looks exactly like you seems very unusual. It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.\n\nNow let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins. The second line contains a sequence of *n* integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the coins' values. All numbers are separated with spaces.. Output specification: In the single line print the single number \u2014 the minimum needed number of coins.\nDemo input: ['2\\n3 3\\n', '3\\n2 1 2\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: In the first sample you will have to take 2 coins (you and your twin have sums equal to 6,\u20090 correspondingly). If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too. You can pick coins with values 1,\u20092 or 2,\u20092. In any case, the minimum number of coins equals 2."}]}}

Each cell of the field is a 1<=\u00d7<=1 square. The robotic arm has two lasers pointed at the field perpendicularly to its surface.

Since the lasers are on the robotic hand, their movements are synchronized \u2014 if you move one of the lasers by a vector, another one moves by the same vector.\n\nThe following facts about the experiment are known: \n -  initially the whole field is covered with a chocolate bar of the size *n*<=\u00d7<=*m*, both lasers are located above the field and are active; -  the chocolate melts within one cell of the field at which the laser is pointed; -  all moves of the robotic arm should be parallel to the sides of the field, after each move the lasers should be pointed at the centres of some two cells; -  at any one time both lasers should be pointed at the field.

Otherwise, according to Vasya's method, the temperature of the (*n*<=+<=1)-th day will be equal to the temperature of the *n*-th day.\n\nYour task is to help Vasya predict the average temperature for tomorrow, i. e. for the (*n*<=+<=1)-th day.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of days for which the average air temperature is known.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n* (<=-<=1000<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=1000)\u00a0\u2014 where *t**i* is the average temperature in the *i*-th day..

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here.

Write a python script for the following problem: Peter got a new snow blower as a New Year present. Of course, Peter decided to try it immediately. After reading the instructions he realized that it does not work like regular snow blowing machines.

Then, after the machine is switched on, it will make a circle around the point to which Peter tied it (this point lies strictly outside the polygon).

Write a python script for the following problem: Vasya learns to type. He has an unusual keyboard at his disposal: it is rectangular and it has *n* rows of keys containing *m* keys in each row. Besides, the keys are of two types. Some of the keys have lowercase Latin letters on them and some of the keys work like the \"Shift\" key on standard keyboards, that is, they make lowercase letters uppercase.\n\nVasya can press one or two keys with one hand. However, he can only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the keys does not exceed *x*. The keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.\n\nVasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest \"Shift\" key is strictly larger than *x*. In this case he will have to use his other hand. Having typed the symbol, Vasya returns other hand back to the chips.\n\nYou are given Vasya's keyboard and the text. Count the minimum number of times Vasya will have to use the other hand.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *x* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=30,<=1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=50).\n\nNext *n* lines contain descriptions of all the keyboard keys. Each line contains the descriptions of exactly *m* keys, without spaces. The letter keys are marked with the corresponding lowercase letters. The \"Shift\" keys are marked with the \"S\" symbol. \n\nThen follow the length of the text *q* (1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=5\u00b7105). The last line contains the text *T*, which consists of *q* symbols, which are uppercase and lowercase Latin letters..

So he wondered what maximum and minimum sum of money these passengers could have paid for the ride.\n\nThe bus fare equals one berland ruble in High Bertown. However, not everything is that easy \u2014 no more than one child can ride for free with each grown-up passenger. That means that a grown-up passenger who rides with his *k* (*k*<=&gt;<=0) children, pays overall *k* rubles: a ticket for himself and (*k*<=-<=1) tickets for his children. Also, a grown-up can ride without children, in this case he only pays one ruble.\n\nWe know that in High Bertown children can't ride in a bus unaccompanied by grown-ups.\n\nHelp Vasya count the minimum and the maximum sum in Berland rubles, that all passengers of this bus could have paid in total.\nInput specification: The input file consists of a single line containing two space-separated numbers *n* and *m* (0<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of the grown-ups and the number of the children in the bus, correspondingly..

In this case the passengers pay two rubles in total. -  One of the grown-ups ride with two children's and pays two rubles, the another one rides alone and pays one ruble for himself. So, they pay three rubles in total."}]}}

The King had a beautiful daughter, Victoria. They lived happily, but not happily ever after: one day a vicious dragon attacked the kingdom and stole Victoria. The King was full of grief, yet he gathered his noble knights and promised half of his kingdom and Victoria's hand in marriage to the one who will save the girl from the infernal beast.\n\nHaving travelled for some time, the knights found the dragon's lair and all of them rushed there to save Victoria. Each knight spat on the dragon once and, as the dragon had quite a fragile and frail heart, his heart broke and poor beast died. As for the noble knights, they got Victoria right to the King and started brawling as each one wanted the girl's hand in marriage.\n\nThe problem was that all the noble knights were equally noble and equally handsome, and Victoria didn't want to marry any of them anyway. Then the King (and he was a very wise man and didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings) decided to find out who will get his daughter randomly, i.e. tossing a coin. However, there turned out to be *n* noble knights and the coin only has two sides. The good thing is that when a coin is tossed, the coin falls on each side with equal probability. The King got interested how to pick one noble knight using this coin so that all knights had equal probability of being chosen (the probability in that case should always be equal to 1<=/<=*n*). First the King wants to know the expected number of times he will need to toss a coin to determine the winner.

He's been working there for a long time and is satisfied with his job, as it allows him to eat out in the best restaurants and order the most expensive and exotic wood types there. \n\nThe content special agent has got an important task: to get the latest research by British scientists on the English Language. These developments are encoded and stored in a large safe. The Beaver's teeth are strong enough, so the authorities assured that upon arriving at the place the beaver won't have any problems with opening the safe.\n\nAnd he finishes his aspen sprig and leaves for this important task. Of course, the Beaver arrived at the location without any problems, but alas. He can't open the safe with his strong and big teeth. At this point, the Smart Beaver get a call from the headquarters and learns that opening the safe with the teeth is not necessary, as a reliable source has sent the following information: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. There also is a special hint, which can be used to open the safe. The hint is string *s* with the following structure:\n -  if *s**i* = \"?\", then the digit that goes *i*-th in the safe code can be anything (between 0 to 9, inclusively); -  if *s**i* is a digit (between 0 to 9, inclusively), then it means that there is digit *s**i* on position *i* in code; -  if the string contains letters from \"A\" to \"J\", then all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits and the positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits. -  The length of the safe code coincides with the length of the hint. \nFor example, hint \"?JGJ9\" has such matching safe code variants: \"51919\", \"55959\", \"12329\", \"93539\" and so on, and has wrong variants such as: \"56669\", \"00111\", \"03539\" and \"13666\".\n\nAfter receiving such information, the authorities change the plan and ask the special agents to work quietly and gently and not to try to open the safe by mechanical means, and try to find the password using the given hint.\n\nAt a special agent school the Smart Beaver was the fastest in his platoon finding codes for such safes, but now he is not in that shape: the years take their toll ... Help him to determine the number of possible variants of the code to the safe, matching the given hint.

She offered the students a string consisting of *n* small Latin letters; the task was to learn the way the letters that the string contains are written. However, as Gerald is too lazy, he has no desire whatsoever to learn those letters. That's why he decided to lose some part of the string (not necessarily a connected part). The lost part can consist of any number of segments of any length, at any distance from each other. However, Gerald knows that if he loses more than *k* characters, it will be very suspicious. \n\nFind the least number of distinct characters that can remain in the string after no more than *k* characters are deleted. You also have to find any possible way to delete the characters.\nInput specification: The first input data line contains a string whose length is equal to *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105).

Thus, the right answer is 1 and any string consisting of characters \"a\" from 1 to 5 in length.\n\nIn the second sample you are allowed to delete 4 characters. You cannot delete all the characters, because the string has length equal to 7. However, you can delete all characters apart from \"a\" (as they are no more than four), which will result in the \"aaaa\" string.\n\nIn the third sample you are given a line whose length is equal to 8, and *k*\u2009=\u200910, so that the whole line can be deleted.

Output specification: If Simon wins, print \"0\" (without the quotes), otherwise print \"1\" (without the quotes).\nDemo input: ['3 5 9\\n', '1 1 100\\n'], Demo output: ['0', '1']\nNote: The greatest common divisor of two non-negative integers *a* and *b* is such maximum positive integer *k*, that *a* is divisible by *k* without remainder and similarly, *b* is divisible by *k* without remainder. Let *gcd*(*a*,\u2009*b*) represent the operation of calculating the greatest common divisor of numbers *a* and *b*. Specifically, *gcd*(*x*,\u20090)\u2009=\u2009*gcd*(0,\u2009*x*)\u2009=\u2009*x*.\n\nIn the first sample the game will go like that:\n-  Simon should take *gcd*(3,\u20099)\u2009=\u20093 stones from the heap. After his move the heap has 6 stones left.-  Antisimon should take *gcd*(5,\u20096)\u2009=\u20091 stone from the heap. After his move the heap has 5 stones left.-  Simon should take *gcd*(3,\u20095)\u2009=\u20091 stone from the heap. After his move the heap has 4 stones left.-  Antisimon should take *gcd*(5,\u20094)\u2009=\u20091 stone from the heap. After his move the heap has 3 stones left.-  Simon should take *gcd*(3,\u20093)\u2009=\u20093 stones from the heap. After his move the heap has 0 stones left.-  Antisimon should take *gcd*(5,\u20090)\u2009=\u20095 stones from the heap. As 0\u2009&lt;\u20095, it is impossible and Antisimon loses.\nIn the second sample each player during each move takes one stone from the heap. As *n* is even, Antisimon takes the last stone and Simon can't make a move after that."}]}}

Formally, a string *p* of length *n* is lexicographically less than string *q* of length *m*, if one of the two statements is correct:\n -  *n*<=&lt;<=*m*, and *p* is the beginning (prefix) of string *q* (for example, \"aba\" is less than string \"abaa\"), -  *p*1<==<=*q*1, *p*2<==<=*q*2, ..., *p**k*<=-<=1<==<=*q**k*<=-<=1, *p**k*<=&lt;<=*q**k* for some *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*min*(*n*,<=*m*)), here characters in strings are numbered starting from 1. \nWrite a program that, given string *s* and the heighbours' child's name *t* determines the string that is the result of permutation of letters in *s*. The string should be lexicographically strictly more than *t* and also, lexicographically minimum.\nInput specification: The first line contains a non-empty string *s* (1<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=5000), where |*s*| is its length. The second line contains a non-empty string *t* (1<=\u2264<=|*t*|<=\u2264<=5000), where |*t*| is its length. Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters.. Output specification: Print the sought name or -1 if it doesn't exist.\nDemo input: ['aad\\naac\\n', 'abad\\nbob\\n', 'abc\\ndefg\\n', 'czaaab\\nabcdef\\n'], Demo output: ['aad\\n', 'daab\\n', '-1\\n', 'abczaa\\n']\nNote: In the first sample the given string *s* is the sought one, consequently, we do not need to change the letter order there."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Mad scientist Mike has just finished constructing a new device to search for extraterrestrial intelligence! He was in such a hurry to launch it for the first time that he plugged in the power wires without giving it a proper glance and started experimenting right away. After a while Mike observed that the wires ended up entangled and now have to be untangled again.\n\nThe device is powered by two wires \"plus\" and \"minus\". The wires run along the floor from the wall (on the left) to the device (on the right). Both the wall and the device have two contacts in them on the same level, into which the wires are plugged in some order. The wires are considered entangled if there are one or more places where one wire runs above the other one. For example, the picture below has four such places (top view):\n\nMike knows the sequence in which the wires run above each other. Mike also noticed that on the left side, the \"plus\" wire is always plugged into the top contact (as seen on the picture). He would like to untangle the wires without unplugging them and without moving the device. Determine if it is possible to do that. A wire can be freely moved and stretched on the floor, but cannot be cut.\n\nTo understand the problem better please read the notes to the test samples.\nInput specification: The single line of the input contains a sequence of characters \"+\" and \"-\" of length *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000). The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) position of the sequence contains the character \"+\", if on the *i*-th step from the wall the \"plus\" wire runs above the \"minus\" wire, and the character \"-\" otherwise..

To untangle the wires, one can first move the \"plus\" wire lower, thus eliminating the two crosses in the middle, and then draw it under the \"minus\" wire, eliminating also the remaining two crosses.\n\nIn the second testcase the \"plus\" wire makes one full revolution around the \"minus\" wire. Thus the wires cannot be untangled: \n\nIn the third testcase the \"plus\" wire simply runs above the \"minus\" wire twice in sequence. The wires can be untangled by lifting \"plus\" and moving it higher: \n\nIn the fourth testcase the \"minus\" wire runs above the \"plus\" wire once. The wires cannot be untangled without moving the device itself:"}]}}

Also, each pair has different letters and each letter occurs in no more than one forbidden pair.\n\nNow Sergey wants to correct his sentence so that it doesn't contain any \"forbidden\" pairs of letters that stand next to each other. However, he is running out of time, so he decided to simply cross out some letters from the sentence. What smallest number of letters will he have to cross out? When a letter is crossed out, it is \"removed\" so that the letters to its left and right (if they existed), become neighboring. For example, if we cross out the first letter from the string \"aba\", we get the string \"ba\", and if we cross out the second letter, we get \"aa\".\nInput specification: The first line contains a non-empty string *s*, consisting of lowercase Latin letters \u2014 that's the initial sentence in *N*-ish, written by Sergey. The length of string *s* doesn't exceed 105.\n\nThe next line contains integer *k* (0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=13) \u2014 the number of forbidden pairs of letters.\n\nNext *k* lines contain descriptions of forbidden pairs of letters. Each line contains exactly two different lowercase Latin letters without separators that represent the forbidden pairs. It is guaranteed that each letter is included in no more than one pair.. Output specification: Print the single number \u2014 the smallest number of letters that need to be removed to get a string without any forbidden pairs of neighboring letters. Please note that the answer always exists as it is always possible to remove all letters.\nDemo input: ['ababa\\n1\\nab\\n', 'codeforces\\n2\\ndo\\ncs\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: In the first sample you should remove two letters b.\n\nIn the second sample you should remove the second or the third letter. The second restriction doesn't influence the solution."}]}}

Specifically, during step *t**i* (steps are numbered from 1) Xenia watches spies numbers *l**i*,<=*l**i*<=+<=1,<=*l**i*<=+<=2,<=...,<=*r**i* (1<=\u2264<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*). Of course, if during some step a spy is watched, he can't do anything: neither give the note nor take it from some other spy. Otherwise, Xenia reveals the spies' cunning plot. Nevertheless, if the spy at the current step keeps the note, Xenia sees nothing suspicious even if she watches him.\n\nYou've got *s* and *f*. Also, you have the steps during which Xenia watches spies and which spies she is going to watch during each step. Find the best way the spies should act in order to pass the note from spy *s* to spy *f* as quickly as possible (in the minimum number of steps).\nInput specification: The first line contains four integers *n*, *m*, *s* and *f* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*s*,<=*f*<=\u2264<=*n*;\u00a0*s*<=\u2260<=*f*;\u00a0*n*<=\u2265<=2). Each of the following *m* lines contains three integers *t**i*,<=*l**i*,<=*r**i* (1<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=109,<=1<=\u2264<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*). It is guaranteed that *t*1<=&lt;<=*t*2<=&lt;<=*t*3<=&lt;<=...<=&lt;<=*t**m*.. Output specification: Print *k* characters in a line: the *i*-th character in the line must represent the spies' actions on step *i*. If on step *i* the spy with the note must pass the note to the spy with a lesser number, the *i*-th character should equal \"L\". If on step *i* the spy with the note must pass it to the spy with a larger number, the *i*-th character must equal \"R\". If the spy must keep the note at the *i*-th step, the *i*-th character must equal \"X\".\n\nAs a result of applying the printed sequence of actions spy *s* must pass the note to spy *f*. The number of printed characters *k* must be as small as possible. Xenia must not catch the spies passing the note.\n\nIf there are miltiple optimal solutions, you can print any of them. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.\nDemo input: ['3 5 1 3\\n1 1 2\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 3\\n4 1 1\\n10 1 3\\n'], Demo output: ['XXRR\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: A new innovative ticketing systems for public transport is introduced in Bytesburg. Now there is a single travel card for all transport. To make a trip a passenger scan his card and then he is charged according to the fare.\n\nThe fare is constructed in the following manner. There are three types of tickets: \n 1.  a ticket for one trip costs 20 byteland rubles, 1.  a ticket for 90 minutes costs 50 byteland rubles, 1.  a ticket for one day (1440 minutes) costs 120 byteland rubles. \nNote that a ticket for *x* minutes activated at time *t* can be used for trips started in time range from *t* to *t*<=+<=*x*<=-<=1, inclusive. Assume that all trips take exactly one minute.\n\nTo simplify the choice for the passenger, the system automatically chooses the optimal tickets. After each trip starts, the system analyses all the previous trips and the current trip and chooses a set of tickets for these trips with a minimum total cost. Let the minimum total cost of tickets to cover all trips from the first to the current is *a*, and the total sum charged before is *b*. Then the system charges the passenger the sum *a*<=-<=*b*.\n\nYou have to write a program that, for given trips made by a passenger, calculates the sum the passenger is charged after each trip.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains integer number *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of trips made by passenger.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains the time of trip *t**i* (0<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=109), measured in minutes from the time of starting the system. All *t**i* are different, given in ascending order, i.\u00a0e. *t**i*<=+<=1<=&gt;<=*t**i* holds for all 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*n*.. Output specification: Output *n* integers.

This ticket costs 50 rubles, and the passenger had already paid 40 rubles, so it is necessary to charge 10 rubles only."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.\n\nThere are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.\n\nOfficer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:\n -  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$; -  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. \nFor example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\n\nThe structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.\n\nFormally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.\n\nBerland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.\n\nSuppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ \u2014 one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.\n\nLet's look at the following example:\n\nIf officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.\n\nIf officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.\n\nTo answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.\n\nYou should process queries independently.

Write a python script for the following problem: A Ministry for Defense sent a general to inspect the Super Secret Military Squad under the command of the Colonel SuperDuper. Having learned the news, the colonel ordered to all *n* squad soldiers to line up on the parade ground.\n\nBy the military charter the soldiers should stand in the order of non-increasing of their height. But as there's virtually no time to do that, the soldiers lined up in the arbitrary order. However, the general is rather short-sighted and he thinks that the soldiers lined up correctly if the first soldier in the line has the maximum height and the last soldier has the minimum height. Please note that the way other solders are positioned does not matter, including the case when there are several soldiers whose height is maximum or minimum. Only the heights of the first and the last soldier are important.\n\nFor example, the general considers the sequence of heights (4, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1) correct and the sequence (4, 3, 1, 2, 2) wrong.\n\nWithin one second the colonel can swap any two neighboring soldiers. Help him count the minimum time needed to form a line-up which the general will consider correct.\nInput specification: The first input line contains the only integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) which represents the number of soldiers in the line. The second line contains integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) the values of the soldiers' heights in the order of soldiers' heights' increasing in the order from the beginning of the line to its end. The numbers are space-separated. Numbers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* are not necessarily different.. Output specification: Print the only integer \u2014 the minimum number of seconds the colonel will need to form a line-up the general will like.\nDemo input: ['4\\n33 44 11 22\\n', '7\\n10 10 58 31 63 40 76\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '10\\n']\nNote: In the first sample the colonel will need to swap the first and second soldier and then the third and fourth soldier. That will take 2 seconds. The resulting position of the soldiers is (44, 33, 22, 11).\n\nIn the second sample the colonel may swap the soldiers in the following sequence:\n 1.

Write a python script for the following problem: Teacher thinks that we make a lot of progress. Now we are even allowed to use decimal notation instead of counting sticks. After the test the teacher promised to show us a \"very beautiful number\". But the problem is, he's left his paper with the number in the teachers' office.\n\nThe teacher remembers that the \"very beautiful number\" was strictly positive, didn't contain any leading zeroes, had the length of exactly *p* decimal digits, and if we move the last digit of the number to the beginning, it grows exactly *x* times. Besides, the teacher is sure that among all such numbers the \"very beautiful number\" is minimal possible.\n\nThe teachers' office isn't near and the teacher isn't young. But we've passed the test and we deserved the right to see the \"very beautiful number\". Help to restore the justice, find the \"very beautiful number\" for us!\nInput specification: The single line contains integers *p*, *x* (1<=\u2264<=*p*<=\u2264<=106,<=1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=9)..

Write a python script for the following problem: Developers often face with regular expression patterns. A pattern is usually defined as a string consisting of characters and metacharacters that sets the rules for your search. These patterns are most often used to check whether a particular string meets the certain rules.\n\nIn this task, a pattern will be a string consisting of small English letters and question marks ('?'). The question mark in the pattern is a metacharacter that denotes an arbitrary small letter of the English alphabet. We will assume that a string matches the pattern if we can transform the string into the pattern by replacing the question marks by the appropriate characters. For example, string aba matches patterns: ???, ??a, a?a, aba.\n\nProgrammers that work for the R1 company love puzzling each other (and themselves) with riddles. One of them is as follows: you are given *n* patterns of the same length, you need to find a pattern that contains as few question marks as possible, and intersects with each of the given patterns. Two patterns intersect if there is a string that matches both the first and the second pattern. Can you solve this riddle?\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of patterns. Next *n* lines contain the patterns.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the patterns can only consist of small English letters and symbols '?'. All patterns are non-empty and have the same length. The total length of all the patterns does not exceed 105 characters.. Output specification: In a single line print the answer to the problem \u2014 the pattern with the minimal number of signs '?', which intersects with each of the given ones.

Pattern xab intersects with each of the given patterns. Pattern ??? also intersects with each of the given patterns, but it contains more question signs, hence it is not an optimal answer. Clearly, xab is the optimal answer, because it doesn't contain any question sign. There are a lot of other optimal answers, for example: aab, bab, cab, dab and so on."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: As we all know, Max is the best video game player among her friends. Her friends were so jealous of hers, that they created an actual game just to prove that she's not the best at games. The game is played on a directed acyclic graph (a DAG) with *n* vertices and *m* edges. There's a character written on each edge, a lowercase English letter.\n\nMax and Lucas are playing the game. Max goes first, then Lucas, then Max again and so on. Each player has a marble, initially located at some vertex. Each player in his/her turn should move his/her marble along some edge (a player can move the marble from vertex *v* to vertex *u* if there's an outgoing edge from *v* to *u*). If the player moves his/her marble from vertex *v* to vertex *u*, the \"character\" of that round is the character written on the edge from *v* to *u*. There's one additional rule; the ASCII code of character of round *i* should be greater than or equal to the ASCII code of character of round *i*<=-<=1 (for *i*<=&gt;<=1). The rounds are numbered for both players together, i.\u00a0e. Max goes in odd numbers, Lucas goes in even numbers. The player that can't make a move loses the game. The marbles may be at the same vertex at the same time.\n\nSince the game could take a while and Lucas and Max have to focus on finding Dart, they don't have time to play. So they asked you, if they both play optimally, who wins the game?\n\nYou have to determine the winner of the game for all initial positions of the marbles.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains two integers *n* and *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100, ).\n\nThe next *m* lines contain the edges.

Your task is to find the number of connected components which are cycles.\n\nHere are some definitions of graph theory.\n\nAn undirected graph consists of two sets: set of nodes (called vertices) and set of edges. Each edge connects a pair of vertices. All edges are bidirectional (i.e. if a vertex $a$ is connected with a vertex $b$, a vertex $b$ is also connected with a vertex $a$). An edge can't connect vertex with itself, there is at most one edge between a pair of vertices.\n\nTwo vertices $u$ and $v$ belong to the same connected component if and only if there is at least one path along edges connecting $u$ and $v$.\n\nA connected component is a cycle if and only if its vertices can be reordered in such a way that:\n -  the first vertex is connected with the second vertex by an edge, -  the second vertex is connected with the third vertex by an edge, -  ... -  the last vertex is connected with the first vertex by an edge, -  all the described edges of a cycle are distinct. \nA cycle doesn't contain any other edges except described above.

Write a python script for the following problem: \"Eat a beaver, save a tree!\" \u2014 That will be the motto of ecologists' urgent meeting in Beaverley Hills.\n\nAnd the whole point is that the population of beavers on the Earth has reached incredible sizes! Each day their number increases in several times and they don't even realize how much their unhealthy obsession with trees harms the nature and the humankind. The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has dropped to 17 per cent and, as the best minds of the world think, that is not the end.\n\nIn the middle of the 50-s of the previous century a group of soviet scientists succeed in foreseeing the situation with beavers and worked out a secret technology to clean territory. The technology bears a mysterious title \"Beavermuncher-0xFF\". Now the fate of the planet lies on the fragile shoulders of a small group of people who has dedicated their lives to science.\n\nThe prototype is ready, you now need to urgently carry out its experiments in practice. \n\nYou are given a tree, completely occupied by beavers. A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. The tree consists of *n* vertices, the *i*-th vertex contains *k**i* beavers. \n\n\"Beavermuncher-0xFF\" works by the following principle: being at some vertex *u*, it can go to the vertex *v*, if they are connected by an edge, and eat exactly one beaver located at the vertex *v*. It is impossible to move to the vertex *v* if there are no beavers left in *v*. \"Beavermuncher-0xFF\" cannot just stand at some vertex and eat beavers in it. \"Beavermuncher-0xFF\" must move without stops.\n\nWhy does the \"Beavermuncher-0xFF\" works like this? Because the developers have not provided place for the battery in it and eating beavers is necessary for converting their mass into pure energy.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the beavers will be shocked by what is happening, which is why they will not be able to move from a vertex of the tree to another one. As for the \"Beavermuncher-0xFF\", it can move along each edge in both directions while conditions described above are fulfilled.\n\nThe root of the tree is located at the vertex *s*. This means that the \"Beavermuncher-0xFF\" begins its mission at the vertex *s* and it must return there at the end of experiment, because no one is going to take it down from a high place. \n\nDetermine the maximum number of beavers \"Beavermuncher-0xFF\" can eat and return to the starting vertex.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105).

Each line contains two integers separated by space. These integers represent two vertices connected by an edge. Vertices are numbered from 1 to *n*. The last line contains integer *s* \u2014 the number of the starting vertex (1<=\u2264<=*s*<=\u2264<=*n*)..

Write a python script for the following problem: Each year in the castle of Dwarven King there is a competition in growing mushrooms among the dwarves. The competition is one of the most prestigious ones, and the winner gets a wooden salad bowl. This year's event brought together the best mushroom growers from around the world, so we had to slightly change the rules so that the event gets more interesting to watch.\n\nEach mushroom grower has a mushroom that he will grow on the competition. Under the new rules, the competition consists of two parts. The first part lasts *t*1 seconds and the second part lasts *t*2 seconds. The first and the second part are separated by a little break.\n\nAfter the starting whistle the first part of the contest starts, and all mushroom growers start growing mushrooms at once, each at his individual speed of *v**i* meters per second. After *t*1 seconds, the mushroom growers stop growing mushrooms and go to have a break. During the break, for unexplained reasons, the growth of all mushrooms is reduced by *k* percent. After the break the second part of the contest starts and all mushrooms growers at the same time continue to grow mushrooms, each at his individual speed of *u**i* meters per second. After a *t*2 seconds after the end of the break, the competition ends. Note that the speeds before and after the break may vary.\n\nBefore the match dwarf Pasha learned from all participants, what two speeds they have chosen. However, the participants did not want to disclose to him all their strategy and therefore, did not say in what order they will be using these speeds. That is, if a participant chose speeds *a**i* and *b**i*, then there are two strategies: he either uses speed *a**i* before the break and speed *b**i* after it, or vice versa.\n\nDwarf Pasha really wants to win the totalizer. He knows that each participant chooses the strategy that maximizes the height of the mushroom. Help Dwarf Pasha make the final table of competition results.\n\nThe participants are sorted in the result table by the mushroom height (the participants with higher mushrooms follow earlier in the table).

All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.\nInput specification: The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100;1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *t* \u2014 the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* \u2014 the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.. Output specification: Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession. Output lines should go in the same order in which the operations are processed. Successful procession of alloc operation should return integers, starting with 1, as the identifiers of the allocated blocks.\nDemo input: ['6 10\\nalloc 5\\nalloc 3\\nerase 1\\nalloc 6\\ndefragment\\nalloc 6\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n2\\nNULL\\n3\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

The education is not easy because you need to have fundamental knowledge in different areas, which sometimes are not related to each other. \n\nFor example, you should know linguistics very well. You learn a structure of Reberland language as foreign language. In this language words are constructed according to the following rules. First you need to choose the \"root\" of the word \u2014 some string which has more than 4 letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3 symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction \u2014  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row. All these strings are considered to be suffixes of the word (this time we use word \"suffix\" to describe a morpheme but not the few last characters of the string as you may used to). \n\nHere is one exercise that you have found in your task list. You are given the word *s*. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language. \n\nTwo strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match. \n\nLet's look at the example: the word *abacabaca* is given. This word can be obtained in the following ways: , where the root of the word is overlined, and suffixes are marked by \"corners\".
