Write a python script for the following problem: Kevin Sun has just finished competing in Codeforces Round #334! The round was 120 minutes long and featured five problems with maximum point values of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500, respectively. Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.\n\nCodeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is *x*, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute *m* but made *w* wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is . His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.\n\nAll arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains five space-separated integers *m*1, *m*2, *m*3, *m*4, *m*5, where *m**i* (0<=\u2264<=*m**i*<=\u2264<=119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem *i*. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted.\n\nThe second line contains five space-separated integers *w*1, *w*2, *w*3, *w*4, *w*5, where *w**i* (0<=\u2264<=*w**i*<=\u2264<=10) is Kevin's number of wrong submissions on problem *i*.\n\nThe last line contains two space-separated integers *h**s* and *h**u* (0<=\u2264<=*h**s*,<=*h**u*<=\u2264<=20), denoting the Kevin's numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively.. Output specification: Print a single integer, the value of Kevin's final score.\nDemo input: ['20 40 60 80 100\\n0 1 2 3 4\\n1 0\\n', '119 119 119 119 119\\n0 0 0 0 0\\n10 0\\n'], Demo output: ['4900\\n', '4930\\n']\nNote: In the second sample, Kevin takes 119 minutes on all of the problems. Therefore, he gets <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/42158dc2bc78cd21fa679530ae9ef8b9ea298d15.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> of the points on each problem. So his score from solving problems is <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/fdf392d8508500b57f8057ac0c4c892ab5f925a2.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>. Adding in 10\u00b7100\u2009=\u20091000 points from hacks, his total score becomes 3930\u2009+\u20091000\u2009=\u20094930."}]}}

At first night he received embosser and was to take stock of the whole exposition.\n\nEmbosser is a special devise that allows to \"print\" the text of a plastic tape. Text is printed sequentially, character by character. The device consists of a wheel with a lowercase English letters written in a circle, static pointer to the current letter and a button that print the chosen letter. At one move it's allowed to rotate the alphabetic wheel one step clockwise or counterclockwise. Initially, static pointer points to letter 'a'. Other letters are located as shown on the picture:\n\nAfter Grigoriy add new item to the base he has to print its name on the plastic tape and attach it to the corresponding exhibit.

Also, he carefully wrote down all the operations and their results to his event log, following the format: \n -  insert *x*\u00a0\u2014 put the element with value *x* in the heap; -  getMin *x*\u00a0\u2014 the value of the minimum element contained in the heap was equal to *x*; -  removeMin\u00a0\u2014 the minimum element was extracted from the heap (only one instance, if there were many). \nAll the operations were correct, i.e. there was at least one element in the heap each time getMin or removeMin operations were applied.\n\nWhile Petya was away for a lunch, his little brother Vova came to the room, took away some of the pages from Petya's log and used them to make paper boats.\n\nNow Vova is worried, if he made Petya's sequence of operations inconsistent. For example, if one apply operations one-by-one in the order they are written in the event log, results of getMin operations might differ from the results recorded by Petya, and some of getMin or removeMin operations may be incorrect, as the heap is empty at the moment they are applied.\n\nNow Vova wants to add some new operation records to the event log in order to make the resulting sequence of operations correct. That is, the result of each getMin operation is equal to the result in the record, and the heap is non-empty when getMin ad removeMin are applied. Vova wants to complete this as fast as possible, as the Petya may get back at any moment. He asks you to add the least possible number of operation records to the current log.

Output specification: The first line of the output should contain a single integer *m*\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible number of records in the modified sequence of operations.\n\nNext *m* lines should contain the corrected sequence of records following the format of the input (described in the statement), one per line and in the order they are applied. All the numbers in the output should be integers not exceeding 109 by their absolute value.\n\nNote that the input sequence of operations must be the subsequence of the output sequence.\n\nIt's guaranteed that there exists the correct answer consisting of no more than 1<=000<=000 operations.\nDemo input: ['2\\ninsert 3\\ngetMin 4\\n', '4\\ninsert 1\\ninsert 1\\nremoveMin\\ngetMin 2\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\ninsert 3\\nremoveMin\\ninsert 4\\ngetMin 4\\n', '6\\ninsert 1\\ninsert 1\\nremoveMin\\nremoveMin\\ninsert 2\\ngetMin 2\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, after number 3 is inserted into the heap, the minimum number is 3.

For example, after letter 'c' can't go letters 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd', but can go letters 'e', 'f', ..., 'z'.\n\nFor the rocket to fly as far as possible, its weight should be minimal. The weight of the rocket is equal to the sum of the weights of its stages. The weight of the stage is the number of its letter in the alphabet. For example, the stage 'a 'weighs one ton,' b 'weighs two tons, and' z'\u00a0\u2014 $26$ tons.\n\nBuild the rocket with the minimal weight or determine, that it is impossible to build a rocket at all. Each stage can be used at most once.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains two integers\u00a0\u2014 $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n \\le 50$)\u00a0\u2013 the number of available stages and the number of stages to use in the rocket.\n\nThe second line contains string $s$, which consists of exactly $n$ lowercase Latin letters. Each letter defines a new stage, which can be used to build the rocket. Each stage can be used at most once.. Output specification: Print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimal total weight of the rocket or -1, if it is impossible to build the rocket at all.\nDemo input: ['5 3\\nxyabd\\n', '7 4\\nproblem\\n', '2 2\\nab\\n', '12 1\\nabaabbaaabbb\\n'], Demo output: ['29', '34', '-1', '1']\nNote: In the first example, the following rockets satisfy the condition:\n-  \"adx\" (weight is $1+4+24=29$);-  \"ady\" (weight is $1+4+25=30$);-  \"bdx\" (weight is $2+4+24=30$);-  \"bdy\" (weight is $2+4+25=31$).\nRocket \"adx\" has the minimal weight, so the answer is $29$.\n\nIn the second example, target rocket is \"belo\". Its weight is $2+5+12+15=34$.\n\nIn the third example, $n=k=2$, so the rocket must have both stages: 'a' and 'b'. This rocket doesn't satisfy the condition, because these letters are adjacent in the alphabet. Answer is -1."}]}}

You have a choice of making cuts at *n*<=+<=1 places, i.e., Before *b*0, between *b*0 and *b*1, between *b*1 and *b*2, ..., between *b**n*<=-<=2 and *b**n*<=-<=1, and after *b**n*<=-<=1.\n\nThe *n*<=+<=1 choices of making cuts are as follows (where a | denotes a possible cut):\n\nConsider a sequence of *k* cuts. Now each pair of consecutive cuts will contain a binary string between them, formed from the ingredient types. The ingredients before the first cut and after the last cut are wasted, which is to say they are not considered. So there will be exactly *k*<=-<=1 such binary substrings. Every substring can be read as a binary number. Let *m* be the maximum number out of the obtained numbers. If all the obtained numbers are positive and the set of the obtained numbers contains all integers from 1 to *m*, then this set of cuts is said to be a valid set of cuts.\n\nFor example, suppose the given PokeBlock sequence is 101101001110 and we made 5 cuts in the following way:\n\nSo the 4 binary substrings obtained are: 11, 010, 01 and 1, which correspond to the numbers 3, 2, 1 and 1 respectively. Here *m*<==<=3, as it is the maximum value among the obtained numbers. And all the obtained numbers are positive and we have obtained all integers from 1 to *m*. Hence this set of cuts is a valid set of 5 cuts.\n\nA Pokemon of type *k* will evolve only if the PokeBlock is cut using a valid set of *k* cuts. There can be many valid sets of the same size. Two valid sets of *k* cuts are considered different if there is a cut in one set which is not there in the other set.\n\nLet *f*(*k*) denote the number of valid sets of *k* cuts. Find the value of . Since the value of *s* can be very large, output *s* modulo 109<=+<=7.\nInput specification: The input consists of two lines. The first line consists an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=75)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the PokeBlock. The next line contains the PokeBlock, a binary string of length *n*.. Output specification: Output a single integer, containing the answer to the problem, i.e., the value of *s* modulo 109<=+<=7.\nDemo input: ['4\\n1011\\n', '2\\n10\\n'], Demo output: ['10\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, the sets of valid cuts are:\n\nSize 2: |1|011, 1|01|1, 10|1|1, 101|1|.\n\nSize 3: |1|01|1, |10|1|1, 10|1|1|, 1|01|1|.\n\nSize 4: |10|1|1|, |1|01|1|.\n\nHence, *f*(2)\u2009=\u20094, *f*(3)\u2009=\u20094 and *f*(4)\u2009=\u20092. So, the value of *s*\u2009=\u200910.\n\nIn the second sample, the set of valid cuts is:\n\nSize 2: |1|0.\n\nHence, *f*(2)\u2009=\u20091 and *f*(3)\u2009=\u20090. So, the value of *s*\u2009=\u20091."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Mahmoud and Ehab continue their adventures! As everybody in the evil land knows, Dr. Evil likes bipartite graphs, especially trees.\n\nA tree is a connected acyclic graph. A bipartite graph is a graph, whose vertices can be partitioned into 2 sets in such a way, that for each edge (*u*,<=*v*) that belongs to the graph, *u* and *v* belong to different sets. You can find more formal definitions of a tree and a bipartite graph in the notes section below.\n\nDr. Evil gave Mahmoud and Ehab a tree consisting of *n* nodes and asked them to add edges to it in such a way, that the graph is still bipartite. Besides, after adding these edges the graph should be simple (doesn't contain loops or multiple edges). What is the maximum number of edges they can add?\n\nA loop is an edge, which connects a node with itself. Graph doesn't contain multiple edges when for each pair of nodes there is no more than one edge between them. A cycle and a loop aren't the same .\nInput specification: The first line of input contains an integer *n*\u00a0\u2014 the number of nodes in the tree (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105).\n\nThe next *n*<=-<=1 lines contain integers *u* and *v* (1<=\u2264<=*u*,<=*v*<=\u2264<=*n*, *u*<=\u2260<=*v*)\u00a0\u2014 the description of the edges of the tree.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the given graph is a tree..
