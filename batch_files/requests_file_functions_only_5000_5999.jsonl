Write a python script for the following problem: Alas, finding one's true love is not easy. Masha has been unsuccessful in that yet. Her friend Dasha told Masha about a way to determine the phone number of one's Prince Charming through arithmancy. \n\nThe phone number is divined like that. First one needs to write down one's own phone numbers. For example, let's suppose that Masha's phone number is 12345. After that one should write her favorite digit from 0 to 9 under the first digit of her number. That will be the first digit of the needed number. For example, Masha's favorite digit is 9. The second digit is determined as a half sum of the second digit of Masha's number and the already written down first digit from her beloved one's number. In this case the arithmetic average equals to (2<=+<=9)<=/<=2<==<=5.5. Masha can round the number up or down, depending on her wishes. For example, she chooses the digit 5. Having written down the resulting digit under the second digit of her number, Masha moves to finding the third digit in the same way, i.e. finding the half sum the the third digit of her number and the second digit of the new number. The result is (5<=+<=3)<=/<=2<==<=4. In this case the answer is unique. Thus, every *i*-th digit is determined as an arithmetic average of the *i*-th digit of Masha's number and the *i*<=-<=1-th digit of her true love's number. If needed, the digit can be rounded up or down. For example, Masha can get:\nInput specification: The first line contains nonempty sequence consisting of digits from 0 to 9 \u2014 Masha's phone number. The sequence length does not exceed 50..

Write a python script for the following problem: After the contest in comparing numbers, Shapur's teacher found out that he is a real genius and that no one could possibly do the calculations faster than him even using a super computer!\n\nSome days before the contest, the teacher took a very simple-looking exam and all his *n* students took part in the exam. The teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation.\n\nUnfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.\n\nNow the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers.\n\nShapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: \n -  As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. -  As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include \"-\", \";\" and \"_\". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. -  The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600 -  My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. -  Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN -  You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong. Do this by writing \"WA\" for Wrong answer or \"ACC\" for a correct answer. -  I should remind you that none of the strings (initial strings or answers) are empty. -  Finally, do these as soon as possible. You have less than 2 hours to complete this.\nInput specification: The first three lines contain a string each. These are the initial strings.

Write a python script for the following problem: Mahmoud and Ehab continue their adventures! As everybody in the evil land knows, Dr. Evil likes bipartite graphs, especially trees.\n\nA tree is a connected acyclic graph. A bipartite graph is a graph, whose vertices can be partitioned into 2 sets in such a way, that for each edge (*u*,<=*v*) that belongs to the graph, *u* and *v* belong to different sets. You can find more formal definitions of a tree and a bipartite graph in the notes section below.\n\nDr. Evil gave Mahmoud and Ehab a tree consisting of *n* nodes and asked them to add edges to it in such a way, that the graph is still bipartite. Besides, after adding these edges the graph should be simple (doesn't contain loops or multiple edges). What is the maximum number of edges they can add?\n\nA loop is an edge, which connects a node with itself.

The tree consists of *n* nodes numbered from 1 to *n*, each node *i* having an initial value *a**i*. The root of the tree is node 1.\n\nThis tree has a special property: when a value *val* is added to a value of node *i*, the value -*val* is added to values of all the children of node *i*. Note that when you add value -*val* to a child of node *i*, you also add -(-*val*) to all children of the child of node *i* and so on. Look an example explanation to understand better how it works.\n\nThis tree supports two types of queries:\n -  \"1 *x* *val*\" \u2014 *val* is added to the value of node *x*; -  \"2 *x*\" \u2014 print the current value of node *x*. \nIn order to help Iahub understand the tree better, you must answer *m* queries of the preceding type.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=200000).

Fortunately for Karlsson, there wasn't anybody in his friend's house. Karlsson was not going to be hungry any longer, so he decided to get some food in the house.\n\nKarlsson's gaze immediately fell on *n* wooden cupboards, standing in the kitchen. He immediately realized that these cupboards have hidden jam stocks. Karlsson began to fly greedily around the kitchen, opening and closing the cupboards' doors, grab and empty all the jars of jam that he could find.\n\nAnd now all jars of jam are empty, Karlsson has had enough and does not want to leave traces of his stay, so as not to let down his friend. Each of the cupboards has two doors: the left one and the right one. Karlsson remembers that when he rushed to the kitchen, all the cupboards' left doors were in the same position (open or closed), similarly, all the cupboards' right doors were in the same position (open or closed).

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, Mike was very busy with studying for exams and contests. Now he is going to chill a bit by doing some sight seeing in the city.\n\nCity consists of *n* intersections numbered from 1 to *n*. Mike starts walking from his house located at the intersection number 1 and goes along some sequence of intersections. Walking from intersection number *i* to intersection *j* requires |*i*<=-<=*j*| units of energy. The total energy spent by Mike to visit a sequence of intersections *p*1<==<=1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**k* is equal to  units of energy.\n\nOf course, walking would be boring if there were no shortcuts. A shortcut is a special path that allows Mike walking from one intersection to another requiring only 1 unit of energy. There are exactly *n* shortcuts in Mike's city, the *i**th* of them allows walking from intersection *i* to intersection *a**i* (*i*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=+<=1) (but not in the opposite direction), thus there is exactly one shortcut starting at each intersection. Formally, if Mike chooses a sequence *p*1<==<=1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**k* then for each 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*k* satisfying *p**i*<=+<=1<==<=*a**p**i* and *a**p**i*<=\u2260<=*p**i* Mike will spend only 1 unit of energy instead of |*p**i*<=-<=*p**i*<=+<=1| walking from the intersection *p**i* to intersection *p**i*<=+<=1.

Write a python script for the following problem: New Year is coming in Line World! In this world, there are *n* cells numbered by integers from 1 to *n*, as a 1<=\u00d7<=*n* board. People live in cells. However, it was hard to move between distinct cells, because of the difficulty of escaping the cell. People wanted to meet people who live in other cells.\n\nSo, user tncks0121 has made a transportation system to move between these cells, to celebrate the New Year. First, he thought of *n*<=-<=1 positive integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1. For every integer *i* where 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1 the condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* holds. Next, he made *n*<=-<=1 portals, numbered by integers from 1 to *n*<=-<=1. The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) portal connects cell *i* and cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*), and one can travel from cell *i* to cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) using the *i*-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) to cell *i* using the *i*-th portal. It is easy to see that because of condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* one can't leave the Line World using portals.\n\nCurrently, I am standing at cell 1, and I want to go to cell *t*. However, I don't know whether it is possible to go there. Please determine whether I can go to cell *t* by only using the construted transportation system.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3<=\u00d7<=104) and *t* (2<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of cells, and the index of the cell which I want to go to.\n\nThe second line contains *n*<=-<=1 space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1 (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i*).

He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of dogs.\nDemo input: ['6 6\\n..S...\\n..S.W.\\n.S....\\n..W...\\n...W..\\n......\\n', '1 2\\nSW\\n', '5 5\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS....\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n..SD..\\n..SDW.\\n.SD...\\n.DW...\\nDD.W..\\n......\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS.D..\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n']\nNote: In the first example, we can split the pasture into two halves, one containing wolves and one containing sheep. Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

He likes it so much that on the train he falls asleep. \n\nOnce in summer Peter was going by train from city A to city B, and as usual, was sleeping. Then he woke up, started to look through the window and noticed that every railway station has a flag of a particular colour.\n\nThe boy started to memorize the order of the flags' colours that he had seen. But soon he fell asleep again. Unfortunately, he didn't sleep long, he woke up and went on memorizing the colours. Then he fell asleep again, and that time he slept till the end of the journey.\n\nAt the station he told his parents about what he was doing, and wrote two sequences of the colours that he had seen before and after his sleep, respectively.\n\nPeter's parents know that their son likes to fantasize. They give you the list of the flags' colours at the stations that the train passes sequentially on the way from A to B, and ask you to find out if Peter could see those sequences on the way from A to B, or from B to A. Remember, please, that Peter had two periods of wakefulness.\n\nPeter's parents put lowercase Latin letters for colours. The same letter stands for the same colour, different letters \u2014 for different colours.\nInput specification: The input data contains three lines. The first line contains a non-empty string, whose length does not exceed 105, the string consists of lowercase Latin letters \u2014 the flags' colours at the stations on the way from A to B. On the way from B to A the train passes the same stations, but in reverse order. \n\nThe second line contains the sequence, written by Peter during the first period of wakefulness.

More precisely, we define the distance between two brains *u* and *v* (1<=\u2264<=*u*,<=*v*<=\u2264<=*n*) as the minimum number of brain connectors used when transmitting a thought between these two brains.

His current idea is that the population of the capital of Berland changes over time like an arithmetic progression. Well, or like multiple arithmetic progressions.\n\nPolycarpus believes that if he writes out the population of the capital for several consecutive years in the sequence *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*, then it is convenient to consider the array as several arithmetic progressions, written one after the other. For example, sequence (8,<=6,<=4,<=2,<=1,<=4,<=7,<=10,<=2) can be considered as a sequence of three arithmetic progressions (8,<=6,<=4,<=2), (1,<=4,<=7,<=10) and (2), which are written one after another.\n\nUnfortunately, Polycarpus may not have all the data for the *n* consecutive years (a census of the population doesn't occur every year, after all). For this reason, some values of *a**i* \u200b\u200bmay be unknown. Such values are represented by number -1.\n\nFor a given sequence *a*<==<=(*a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*), which consists of positive integers and values \u200b\u200b-1, find the minimum number of arithmetic progressions Polycarpus needs to get *a*. To get *a*, the progressions need to be written down one after the other. Values \u200b\u200b-1 may correspond to an arbitrary positive integer and the values *a**i*<=&gt;<=0 must be equal to the corresponding elements of sought consecutive record of the progressions.\n\nLet us remind you that a finite sequence *c* is called an arithmetic progression if the difference *c**i*<=+<=1<=-<=*c**i* of any two consecutive elements in it is constant. By definition, any sequence of length 1 is an arithmetic progression.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of elements in the sequence.

Note that it's possible that two ranges' borders share a single common point, but no two dancers have exactly the same ranges.\n\nTsukihi, being one of them, defines the spaciousness to be the area covered by an odd number of movement ranges of dancers who are moving. An example is shown below, with shaded regions representing the spaciousness if everyone moves at the same time.\n\nBut no one keeps moving for the whole night after all, so the whole night's time is divided into two halves \u2014 before midnight and after midnight.

The number of integers represents how many groups of black squares there are in corresponding row or column, and the integers themselves represents the number of consecutive black squares in corresponding group (you can find more detailed explanation in Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_crossword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_crossword)).\n\nAdaltik decided that the general case of japanese crossword is too complicated and drew a row consisting of *n* squares (e.g. japanese crossword sized 1<=\u00d7<=*n*), which he wants to encrypt in the same way as in japanese crossword.\n\nHelp Adaltik find the numbers encrypting the row he drew.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the row. The second line of the input contains a single string consisting of *n* characters 'B' or 'W', ('B' corresponds to black square, 'W'\u00a0\u2014 to white square in the row that Adaltik drew).. Output specification: The first line should contain a single integer *k*\u00a0\u2014 the number of integers encrypting the row, e.g. the number of groups of black squares in the row.\n\nThe second line should contain *k* integers, encrypting the row, e.g. corresponding to sizes of groups of consecutive black squares in the order from left to right.\nDemo input: ['3\\nBBW\\n', '5\\nBWBWB\\n', '4\\nWWWW\\n', '4\\nBBBB\\n', '13\\nWBBBBWWBWBBBW\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n2 ', '3\\n1 1 1 ', '0\\n', '1\\n4 ', '3\\n4 1 3 ']\nNote: The last sample case correspond to the picture in the statement."}]}}

He calls the median letter in a word the letter which is in the middle of the word. If the word's length is even, the median letter is the left of the two middle letters. In the following examples, the median letter is highlighted: contest, info. If the word consists of single letter, then according to above definition this letter is the median letter. \n\nPolycarp encodes each word in the following way: he writes down the median letter of the word, then deletes it and repeats the process until there are no letters left. For example, he encodes the word volga as logva.\n\nYou are given an encoding *s* of some word, your task is to decode it.\nInput specification: The first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2000)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the encoded word.\n\nThe second line contains the string *s* of length *n* consisting of lowercase English letters\u00a0\u2014 the encoding..

Write a python script for the following problem: Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*.

We define the value of the sequence simply as the sum of digits in it.\n\nFor example, the number XXXV evaluates to $35$ and the number IXI\u00a0\u2014 to $12$.\n\nPay attention to the difference to the traditional roman system\u00a0\u2014 in our system any sequence of digits is valid, moreover the order of digits doesn't matter, for example IX means $11$, not $9$.\n\nOne can notice that this system is ambiguous, and some numbers can be written in many different ways. Your goal is to determine how many distinct integers can be represented by exactly $n$ roman digits I, V, X, L.\nInput specification: The only line of the input file contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of roman digits to use.. Output specification: Output a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of distinct integers which can be represented using $n$ roman digits exactly.\nDemo input: ['1\\n', '2\\n', '10\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n', '10\\n', '244\\n']\nNote: In the first sample there are exactly $4$ integers which can be represented\u00a0\u2014 I, V, X and L.\n\nIn the second sample it is possible to represent integers $2$ (II), $6$ (VI), $10$ (VV), $11$ (XI), $15$ (XV), $20$ (XX), $51$ (IL), $55$ (VL), $60$ (XL) and $100$ (LL)."}]}}

For example, if Mike chooses a sequence *p*1<==<=1,<=*p*2<==<=*a**p*1,<=*p*3<==<=*a**p*2,<=...,<=*p**k*<==<=*a**p**k*<=-<=1, he spends exactly *k*<=-<=1 units of total energy walking around them.\n\nBefore going on his adventure, Mike asks you to find the minimum amount of energy required to reach each of the intersections from his home. Formally, for each 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n* Mike is interested in finding minimum possible total energy of some sequence *p*1<==<=1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**k*<==<=*i*.\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of Mike's city intersection.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (*i*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n* , , describing shortcuts of Mike's city, allowing to walk from intersection *i* to intersection *a**i* using only 1 unit of energy. Please note that the shortcuts don't allow walking in opposite directions (from *a**i* to *i*).. Output specification: In the only line print *n* integers *m*1,<=*m*2,<=...,<=*m**n*, where *m**i* denotes the least amount of total energy required to walk from intersection 1 to intersection *i*.\nDemo input: ['3\\n2 2 3\\n', '5\\n1 2 3 4 5\\n', '7\\n4 4 4 4 7 7 7\\n'], Demo output: ['0 1 2 \\n', '0 1 2 3 4 \\n', '0 1 2 1 2 3 3 \\n']\nNote: In the first sample case desired sequences are:\n\n1:\u20091; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>\u2009=\u20090;\n\n2:\u20091,\u20092; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>\u2009=\u20091;\n\n3:\u20091,\u20093; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">3</sub>\u2009=\u2009|3\u2009-\u20091|\u2009=\u20092.\n\nIn the second sample case the sequence for any intersection 1\u2009&lt;\u2009*i* is always 1,\u2009*i* and *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">*i*</sub>\u2009=\u2009|1\u2009-\u2009*i*|.\n\nIn the third sample case\u00a0\u2014 consider the following intersection sequences:\n\n1:\u20091; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>\u2009=\u20090;\n\n2:\u20091,\u20092; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>\u2009=\u2009|2\u2009-\u20091|\u2009=\u20091;\n\n3:\u20091,\u20094,\u20093; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">3</sub>\u2009=\u20091\u2009+\u2009|4\u2009-\u20093|\u2009=\u20092;\n\n4:\u20091,\u20094; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">4</sub>\u2009=\u20091;\n\n5:\u20091,\u20094,\u20095; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">5</sub>\u2009=\u20091\u2009+\u2009|4\u2009-\u20095|\u2009=\u20092;\n\n6:\u20091,\u20094,\u20096; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">6</sub>\u2009=\u20091\u2009+\u2009|4\u2009-\u20096|\u2009=\u20093;\n\n7:\u20091,\u20094,\u20095,\u20097; *m*<sub class=\"lower-index\">7</sub>\u2009=\u20091\u2009+\u2009|4\u2009-\u20095|\u2009+\u20091\u2009=\u20093."}]}}

Formally, if *i*-th garland is switched on during *x*-th second, then it is lit only during seconds *x*, *x*<=+<=*k**i*, *x*<=+<=2*k**i*, *x*<=+<=3*k**i* and so on.\n\nMishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers *x*1, *x*2 and *x*3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during *x*1-th second, the second one \u2014 during *x*2-th second, and the third one \u2014 during *x*3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from *max*(*x*1,<=*x*2,<=*x*3) at least one garland will be lit.\n\nHelp Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *k*1, *k*2 and *k*3 (1<=\u2264<=*k**i*<=\u2264<=1500) \u2014 time intervals of the garlands..

Write a python script for the following problem: *T* is a complete binary tree consisting of *n* vertices. It means that exactly one vertex is a root, and each vertex is either a leaf (and doesn't have children) or an inner node (and has exactly two children). All leaves of a complete binary tree have the same depth (distance from the root). So *n* is a number such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nIn the picture you can see a complete binary tree with *n*<==<=15.\n\nVertices are numbered from 1 to *n* in a special recursive way: we recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the left subtree (if current vertex is not a leaf), then assign a number to the current vertex, and then recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the right subtree (if it exists). In the picture vertices are numbered exactly using this algorithm. It is clear that for each size of a complete binary tree exists exactly one way to give numbers to all vertices. This way of numbering is called symmetric.\n\nYou have to write a program that for given *n* answers *q* queries to the tree.\n\nEach query consists of an integer number *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) and a string *s**i*, where *u**i* is the number of vertex, and *s**i* represents the path starting from this vertex. String *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U', which mean traverse to the left child, to the right child and to the parent, respectively. Characters from *s**i* have to be processed from left to right, considering that *u**i* is the vertex where the path starts. If it's impossible to process a character (for example, to go to the left child of a leaf), then you have to skip it. The answer is the number of vertex where the path represented by *s**i* ends.\n\nFor example, if *u**i*<==<=4 and *s**i*<==<=\u00abUURL\u00bb, then the answer is 10.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integer numbers *n* and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1018, *q*<=\u2265<=1). *n* is such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nThe next 2*q* lines represent queries; each query consists of two consecutive lines.

As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed.

For example, the Prophesy \"0012-10-2012-10-2012\" mentions date 12-10-2012 twice (first time as \"0012-10-2012-10-2012\", second time as \"0012-10-2012-10-2012\").\n\nThe date of the Apocalypse is such correct date that the number of times it is mentioned in the Prophesy is strictly larger than that of any other correct date.\n\nA date is correct if the year lies in the range from 2013 to 2015, the month is from 1 to 12, and the number of the day is strictly more than a zero and doesn't exceed the number of days in the current month. Note that a date is written in the format \"dd-mm-yyyy\", that means that leading zeroes may be added to the numbers of the months or days if needed. In other words, date \"1-1-2013\" isn't recorded in the format \"dd-mm-yyyy\", and date \"01-01-2013\" is recorded in it.\n\nNotice, that any year between 2013 and 2015 is not a leap year.\nInput specification: The first line contains the Prophesy: a non-empty string that only consists of digits and characters \"-\". The length of the Prophesy doesn't exceed 105 characters.. Output specification: In a single line print the date of the Apocalypse. It is guaranteed that such date exists and is unique.\nDemo input: ['777-444---21-12-2013-12-2013-12-2013---444-777\\n'], Demo output: ['13-12-2013']\nNote: none"}]}}

The auction is closed, that is, each bidder secretly informs the organizer of the auction price he is willing to pay. After that, the auction winner is the participant who offered the highest price. However, he pay not the price he offers, but the highest price among the offers of other participants (hence the name: the second-price auction).\n\nWrite a program that reads prices offered by bidders and finds the winner and the price he will pay. Consider that all of the offered prices are different.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 number of bidders.

Write a python script for the following problem: There is a very secret base in Potatoland where potato mash is made according to a special recipe. The neighbours from Porridgia decided to seize this recipe and to sell it to Pilauland. For this mission they have been preparing special agent Pearlo for many years. When, finally, Pearlo learned all secrets of espionage, he penetrated into the Potatoland territory and reached the secret base.\n\nNow he is standing at the entrance, but to get inside he need to pass combination lock. Minute ago one of the workers entered the password on the terminal and opened the door. The terminal is a square digital keyboard 3<=\u00d7<=3 with digits from 1 to 9.\n\nPearlo knows that the password consists from distinct digits and is probably symmetric with respect to the central button of the terminal. He has heat sensor which allowed him to detect the digits which the worker pressed. Now he wants to check whether the password entered by the worker is symmetric with respect to the central button of the terminal. This fact can Help Pearlo to reduce the number of different possible password combinations.\nInput specification: Input contains the matrix of three rows of three symbols each.

We denote the length of word *x* as |*x*|. Note that after removing one letter, the indices of other letters don't change. For example, if *t*<==<=\"nastya\" and *a*<==<=[4,<=1,<=5,<=3,<=2,<=6] then removals make the following sequence of words \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\".\n\nSergey knows this permutation. His goal is to stop his sister at some point and continue removing by himself to get the word *p*. Since Nastya likes this activity, Sergey wants to stop her as late as possible. Your task is to determine, how many letters Nastya can remove before she will be stopped by Sergey.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the word *p* can be obtained by removing the letters from word *t*.\nInput specification: The first and second lines of the input contain the words *t* and *p*, respectively. Words are composed of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet (1<=\u2264<=|*p*|<=&lt;<=|*t*|<=\u2264<=200<=000). It is guaranteed that the word *p* can be obtained by removing the letters from word *t*.\n\nNext line contains a permutation *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a*|*t*| of letter indices that specifies the order in which Nastya removes letters of *t* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=|*t*|, all *a**i* are distinct).. Output specification: Print a single integer number, the maximum number of letters that Nastya can remove.\nDemo input: ['ababcba\\nabb\\n5 3 4 1 7 6 2\\n', 'bbbabb\\nbb\\n1 6 3 4 2 5\\n'], Demo output: ['3', '4']\nNote: In the first sample test sequence of removing made by Nastya looks like this:\n\n\"ababcba\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ababcba\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ababcba\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ababcba\" \n\nNastya can not continue, because it is impossible to get word \"abb\" from word \"ababcba\".\n\nSo, Nastya will remove only three letters."}]}}

BFA took the decision to change some World Cup regulations:\n -  the final tournament features *n* teams (*n* is always even) -  the first *n*<=/<=2 teams (according to the standings) come through to the knockout stage -  the standings are made on the following principle: for a victory a team gets 3 points, for a draw \u2014 1 point, for a defeat \u2014 0 points. In the first place, teams are ordered in the standings in decreasing order of their points; in the second place \u2014 in decreasing order of the difference between scored and missed goals; in the third place \u2014 in the decreasing order of scored goals -  it's written in Berland's Constitution that the previous regulation helps to order the teams without ambiguity. \nYou are asked to write a program that, by the given list of the competing teams and the results of all the matches, will find the list of teams that managed to get through to the knockout stage.\nInput specification: The first input line contains the only integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50) \u2014 amount of the teams, taking part in the final tournament of World Cup.

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the elements of array. \n\nThe third line contains integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs.

Write a python script for the following problem: Imagine that you have a twin brother or sister. Having another person that looks exactly like you seems very unusual. It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.\n\nNow let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins. The second line contains a sequence of *n* integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the coins' values. All numbers are separated with spaces..

If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too. You can pick coins with values 1,\u20092 or 2,\u20092. In any case, the minimum number of coins equals 2."}]}}

Namely, the Olympiad number *i* should be prepared by *p**i* people for *t**i* days, the preparation for the Olympiad should be a continuous period of time and end exactly one day before the Olympiad. On the day of the Olympiad the juries who have prepared it, already do not work on it.\n\nFor example, if the Olympiad is held on December 9th and the preparation takes 7 people and 6 days, all seven members of the jury will work on the problems of the Olympiad from December, 3rd to December, 8th (the jury members won't be working on the problems of this Olympiad on December 9th, that is, some of them can start preparing problems for some other Olympiad).

The exit is located at some node *n* where 1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2*h*, the player doesn't know where the exit is so he has to guess his way out!\n\nAmr follows simple algorithm to choose the path. Let's consider infinite command string \"LRLRLRLRL...\" (consisting of alternating characters 'L' and 'R'). Amr sequentially executes the characters of the string using following rules:\n -  Character 'L' means \"go to the left child of the current node\"; -  Character 'R' means \"go to the right child of the current node\"; -  If the destination node is already visited, Amr skips current command, otherwise he moves to the destination node; -  If Amr skipped two consecutive commands, he goes back to the parent of the current node before executing next command; -  If he reached a leaf node that is not the exit, he returns to the parent of the current node; -  If he reaches an exit, the game is finished. \nNow Amr wonders, if he follows this algorithm, how many nodes he is going to visit before reaching the exit?\nInput specification: Input consists of two integers *h*,<=*n* (1<=\u2264<=*h*<=\u2264<=50, 1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2*h*)..

As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too.

How many ways there are to steal exactly one cookie bag so that the total number of cookies in the remaining bags was even?\nInput specification: The first line contains the only integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of cookie bags Anna and Maria have. The second line contains *n* integers *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of cookies in the *i*-th bag.. Output specification: Print in the only line the only number \u2014 the sought number of ways. If there are no such ways print 0.\nDemo input: ['1\\n1\\n', '10\\n1 2 2 3 4 4 4 2 2 2\\n', '11\\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 99\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '8\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: In the first sample Olga should take the only bag so that the twins ended up with the even number of cookies.\n\nIn the second sample Olga can take any of five bags with two cookies or any of three bags with four cookies \u2014 5\u2009+\u20093\u2009=\u20098 ways in total.\n\nIn the third sample, no matter which bag with two cookies Olga chooses, the twins are left with 2\u2009*\u20099\u2009+\u200999\u2009=\u2009117 cookies. Thus, Olga has only one option: to take the bag with 99 cookies."}]}}

A network topology is the way of describing the network configuration, the scheme that shows the location and the connections of network devices.\n\nPolycarpus knows three main network topologies: bus, ring and star. A bus is the topology that represents a shared cable with all computers connected with it. In the ring topology the cable connects each computer only with two other ones. A star is the topology where all computers of a network are connected to the single central node.\n\nLet's represent each of these network topologies as a connected non-directed graph. A bus is a connected graph that is the only path, that is, the graph where all nodes are connected with two other ones except for some two nodes that are the beginning and the end of the path. A ring is a connected graph, where all nodes are connected with two other ones. A star is a connected graph, where a single central node is singled out and connected with all other nodes.

Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective.

Today *n* children got an appointment with him, they lined up in front of his office.\n\nAll children love to cry loudly at the reception at the dentist. We enumerate the children with integers from 1 to *n* in the order they go in the line. Every child is associated with the value of his cofidence *p**i*. The children take turns one after another to come into the office; each time the child that is the first in the line goes to the doctor.\n\nWhile Gennady treats the teeth of the *i*-th child, the child is crying with the volume of *v**i*. At that the confidence of the first child in the line is reduced by the amount of *v**i*, the second one \u2014 by value *v**i*<=-<=1, and so on. The children in the queue after the *v**i*-th child almost do not hear the crying, so their confidence remains unchanged.\n\nIf at any point in time the confidence of the *j*-th child is less than zero, he begins to cry with the volume of *d**j* and leaves the line, running towards the exit, without going to the doctor's office. At this the confidence of all the children after the *j*-th one in the line is reduced by the amount of *d**j*.\n\nAll these events occur immediately one after the other in some order. Some cries may lead to other cries, causing a chain reaction. Once in the hallway it is quiet, the child, who is first in the line, goes into the doctor's office.\n\nHelp Gennady the Dentist to determine the numbers of kids, whose teeth he will cure.

The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 5,\u2009\u2009-\u20091,\u20096,\u20098. Thus, the third child will cry with the volume of 1 and run to the exit. The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 5,\u20095,\u20097. After that, the second child goes to the office and cry with the volume of 5. The confidences of the remaining children will be equal to 0,\u20093. Then the fourth child will go into the office and cry with the volume of 2.

Write a python script for the following problem: A famous Berland's painter Kalevitch likes to shock the public. One of his last obsessions is chess. For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards.\n\nAs before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8<=\u00d7<=8 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke.\n\nKalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client's requirements.\n\nIt goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything \u2014 for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's needs. You are asked to help Kalevitch with this task.\nInput specification: The input file contains 8 lines, each of the lines contains 8 characters.

Write a python script for the following problem: Nowadays, most of the internet advertisements are not statically linked to a web page. Instead, what will be shown to the person opening a web page is determined within 100 milliseconds after the web page is opened. Usually, multiple companies compete for each ad slot on the web page in an auction. Each of them receives a request with details about the user, web page and ad slot and they have to respond within those 100 milliseconds with a bid they would pay for putting an advertisement on that ad slot. The company that suggests the highest bid wins the auction and gets to place its advertisement. If there are several companies tied for the highest bid, the winner gets picked at random.\n\nHowever, the company that won the auction does not have to pay the exact amount of its bid. In most of the cases, a second-price auction is used. This means that the amount paid by the company is equal to the maximum of all the other bids placed for this ad slot.\n\nLet's consider one such bidding. There are *n* companies competing for placing an ad. The *i*-th of these companies will bid an integer number of microdollars equiprobably randomly chosen from the range between *L**i* and *R**i*, inclusive. In the other words, the value of the *i*-th company bid can be any integer from the range [*L**i*,<=*R**i*] with the same probability. \n\nDetermine the expected value that the winner will have to pay in a second-price auction.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains an integer number *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=5). *n* lines follow, the *i*-th of them containing two numbers *L**i* and *R**i* (1<=\u2264<=*L**i*<=\u2264<=*R**i*<=\u2264<=10000) describing the *i*-th company's bid preferences.\n\nThis problem doesn't have subproblems. You will get 8 points for the correct submission.. Output specification: Output the answer with absolute or relative error no more than 1*e*<=-<=9.\nDemo input: ['3\\n4 7\\n8 10\\n5 5\\n', '3\\n2 5\\n3 4\\n1 6\\n'], Demo output: ['5.7500000000\\n', '3.5000000000\\n']\nNote: Consider the first example. The first company bids a random integer number of microdollars in range [4,\u20097]; the second company bids between 8 and 10, and the third company bids 5 microdollars. The second company will win regardless of the exact value it bids, however the price it will pay depends on the value of first company's bid. With probability 0.5 the first company will bid at most 5 microdollars, and the second-highest price of the whole auction will be 5. With probability 0.25 it will bid 6 microdollars, and with probability 0.25 it will bid 7 microdollars. Thus, the expected value the second company will have to pay is 0.5\u00b75\u2009+\u20090.25\u00b76\u2009+\u20090.25\u00b77\u2009=\u20095.75."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Developers often face with regular expression patterns. A pattern is usually defined as a string consisting of characters and metacharacters that sets the rules for your search. These patterns are most often used to check whether a particular string meets the certain rules.\n\nIn this task, a pattern will be a string consisting of small English letters and question marks ('?'). The question mark in the pattern is a metacharacter that denotes an arbitrary small letter of the English alphabet. We will assume that a string matches the pattern if we can transform the string into the pattern by replacing the question marks by the appropriate characters. For example, string aba matches patterns: ???, ??a, a?a, aba.\n\nProgrammers that work for the R1 company love puzzling each other (and themselves) with riddles. One of them is as follows: you are given *n* patterns of the same length, you need to find a pattern that contains as few question marks as possible, and intersects with each of the given patterns. Two patterns intersect if there is a string that matches both the first and the second pattern. Can you solve this riddle?\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of patterns. Next *n* lines contain the patterns.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the patterns can only consist of small English letters and symbols '?'. All patterns are non-empty and have the same length.

Pattern xab intersects with each of the given patterns. Pattern ??? also intersects with each of the given patterns, but it contains more question signs, hence it is not an optimal answer. Clearly, xab is the optimal answer, because it doesn't contain any question sign. There are a lot of other optimal answers, for example: aab, bab, cab, dab and so on."}]}}

His today's task is to type up an already well-designed story using his favorite text editor.\n\nArcady types words, punctuation signs and spaces one after another. Each letter and each sign (including line feed) requires one keyboard click in order to be printed. Moreover, when Arcady has a non-empty prefix of some word on the screen, the editor proposes a possible autocompletion for this word, more precisely one of the already printed words such that its prefix matches the currently printed prefix if this word is unique. For example, if Arcady has already printed \u00abcodeforces\u00bb, \u00abcoding\u00bb and \u00abcodeforces\u00bb once again, then there will be no autocompletion attempt for \u00abcod\u00bb, but if he proceeds with \u00abcode\u00bb, the editor will propose \u00abcodeforces\u00bb.\n\nWith a single click Arcady can follow the editor's proposal, i.e. to transform the current prefix to it. Note that no additional symbols are printed after the autocompletion (no spaces, line feeds, etc). What is the minimum number of keyboard clicks Arcady has to perform to print the entire text, if he is not allowed to move the cursor or erase the already printed symbols?\n\nA word here is a contiguous sequence of latin letters bordered by spaces, punctuation signs and line/text beginnings/ends.

First, he thought of *n*<=-<=1 positive integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1. For every integer *i* where 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1 the condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* holds. Next, he made *n*<=-<=1 portals, numbered by integers from 1 to *n*<=-<=1.

Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up \u2014 who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that\u2019s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player wins.

A \".\" means that the corresponding cell (in the *i*-th row and the *j*-th column) is good, while a \"-\" means it is bad.. Output specification: Output must contain *n* lines, each line must contain a string of *m* characters. The *j*-th character of the *i*-th string should be either \"W\", \"B\" or \"-\". Character \"W\" means the chessman on the cell is white, \"B\" means it is black, \"-\" means the cell is a bad cell.\n\nIf multiple answers exist, print any of them. It is guaranteed that at least one answer exists.\nDemo input: ['1 1\\n.\\n', '2 2\\n..\\n..\\n', '3 3\\n.-.\\n---\\n--.'], Demo output: ['B\\n', 'BW\\nWB\\n', 'B-B\\n---\\n--B']\nNote: In the first sample, DZY puts a single black chessman. Of course putting a white one is also OK.\n\nIn the second sample, all 4 cells are good. No two same chessmen share an edge in the sample output.\n\nIn the third sample, no good cells are adjacent. So you can just put 3 chessmen, no matter what their colors are."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: In Disgaea as in most role-playing games, characters have skills that determine the character's ability to use certain weapons or spells. If the character does not have the necessary skill, he cannot use it. The skill level is represented as an integer that increases when you use this skill. Different character classes are characterized by different skills. \n\nUnfortunately, the skills that are uncommon for the given character's class are quite difficult to obtain. To avoid this limitation, there is the so-called transmigration. \n\nTransmigration is reincarnation of the character in a new creature. His soul shifts to a new body and retains part of his experience from the previous life. \n\nAs a result of transmigration the new character gets all the skills of the old character and the skill levels are reduced according to the *k* coefficient (if the skill level was equal to *x*, then after transmigration it becomes equal to [*kx*], where [*y*] is the integral part of *y*). If some skill's levels are strictly less than 100, these skills are forgotten (the character does not have them any more). After that the new character also gains the skills that are specific for his class, but are new to him. The levels of those additional skills are set to 0. \n\nThus, one can create a character with skills specific for completely different character classes via transmigrations. For example, creating a mage archer or a thief warrior is possible. \n\nYou are suggested to solve the following problem: what skills will the character have after transmigration and what will the levels of those skills be?\nInput specification: The first line contains three numbers *n*, *m* and *k* \u2014 the number of skills the current character has, the number of skills specific for the class into which the character is going to transmigrate and the reducing coefficient respectively; *n* and *m* are integers, and *k* is a real number with exactly two digits after decimal point (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=20, 0.01<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=0.99).\n\nThen follow *n* lines, each of which describes a character's skill in the form \"*name* *exp*\" \u2014 the skill's name and the character's skill level: *name* is a string and *exp* is an integer in range from 0 to 9999, inclusive. \n\nThen follow *m* lines each of which contains names of skills specific for the class, into which the character transmigrates. \n\nAll names consist of lowercase Latin letters and their lengths can range from 1 to 20 characters, inclusive. All character's skills have distinct names. Besides the skills specific for the class into which the player transmigrates also have distinct names.. Output specification: Print on the first line number *z* \u2014 the number of skills the character will have after the transmigration.

If Sagheer buys *k* items with indices *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**k*, then the cost of item *x**j* is *a**x**j*<=+<=*x**j*\u00b7*k* for 1<=\u2264<=*j*<=\u2264<=*k*. In other words, the cost of an item is equal to its base cost in addition to its index multiplied by the factor *k*.\n\nSagheer wants to buy as many souvenirs as possible without paying more than *S* Egyptian pounds. Note that he cannot buy a souvenir more than once. If there are many ways to maximize the number of souvenirs, he will choose the way that will minimize the total cost. Can you help him with this task?\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *S* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105 and 1<=\u2264<=*S*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 the number of souvenirs in the market and Sagheer's budget.\n\nThe second line contains *n* space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the base costs of the souvenirs.. Output specification: On a single line, print two integers *k*, *T*\u00a0\u2014 the maximum number of souvenirs Sagheer can buy and the minimum total cost to buy these *k* souvenirs.\nDemo input: ['3 11\\n2 3 5\\n', '4 100\\n1 2 5 6\\n', '1 7\\n7\\n'], Demo output: ['2 11\\n', '4 54\\n', '0 0\\n']\nNote: In the first example, he cannot take the three items because they will cost him [5,\u20099,\u200914] with total cost 28. If he decides to take only two items, then the costs will be [4,\u20097,\u200911]. So he can afford the first and second items.\n\nIn the second example, he can buy all items as they will cost him [5,\u200910,\u200917,\u200922].\n\nIn the third example, there is only one souvenir in the market which will cost him 8 pounds, so he cannot buy it."}]}}

In one move, Inna can choose two adjacent digits in a number which sum equals 9 and replace them by a single digit 9.\n\nFor instance, Inna can alter number 14545181 like this: 14545181<=\u2192<=1945181<=\u2192<=194519<=\u2192<=19919. Also, she can use this method to transform number 14545181 into number 19991. Inna will not transform it into 149591 as she can get numbers 19919 and 19991 which contain more digits nine.\n\nDima is a programmer so he wants to find out how many distinct numbers containing as many digits nine as possible Inna can get from the written number. Help him with this challenging task.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains integer *a* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=10100000). Number *a* doesn't have any zeroes.. Output specification: In a single line print a single integer \u2014 the answer to the problem. It is guaranteed that the answer to the problem doesn't exceed 263<=-<=1.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nDemo input: ['369727\\n', '123456789987654321\\n', '1\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '1\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: Notes to the samples\n\nIn the first sample Inna can get the following numbers: 369727\u2009\u2192\u200999727\u2009\u2192\u20099997, 369727\u2009\u2192\u200999727\u2009\u2192\u20099979.\n\nIn the second sample, Inna can act like this: 123456789987654321\u2009\u2192\u200912396789987654321\u2009\u2192\u20091239678998769321."}]}}

One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.\n\nBeroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.\n\nFor example:\n -  the following words have typos: \"hellno\", \"hackcerrs\" and \"backtothefutttture\"; -  the following words don't have typos: \"helllllooooo\", \"tobeornottobe\" and \"oooooo\". \nWhen Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.\n\nImplement this feature of Beroffice editor. Consider the following letters as the only vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'. All the other letters are consonants in this problem.\nInput specification: The only line contains a non-empty word consisting of small English letters.

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$.. Output specification: Print the only integer \u2014 maximum possible total time when the lamp is lit.\nDemo input: ['3 10\\n4 6 7\\n', '2 12\\n1 10\\n', '2 7\\n3 4\\n'], Demo output: ['8\\n', '9\\n', '6\\n']\nNote: In the first example, one of possible optimal solutions is to insert value $x = 3$ before $a_1$, so program will be $[3, 4, 6, 7]$ and time of lamp being lit equals $(3 - 0) + (6 - 4) + (10 - 7) = 8$. Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Little Artem likes electronics. He can spend lots of time making different schemas and looking for novelties in the nearest electronics store. The new control element was delivered to the store recently and Artem immediately bought it.\n\nThat element can store information about the matrix of integers size *n*<=\u00d7<=*m*. There are *n*<=+<=*m* inputs in that element, i.e. each row and each column can get the signal. When signal comes to the input corresponding to some row, this row cyclically shifts to the left, that is the first element of the row becomes last element, second element becomes first and so on. When signal comes to the input corresponding to some column, that column shifts cyclically to the top, that is first element of the column becomes last element, second element becomes first and so on. Rows are numbered with integers from 1 to *n* from top to bottom, while columns are numbered with integers from 1 to *m* from left to right.\n\nArtem wants to carefully study this element before using it. For that purpose he is going to set up an experiment consisting of *q* turns. On each turn he either sends the signal to some input or checks what number is stored at some position of the matrix.\n\nArtem has completed his experiment and has written down the results, but he has lost the chip! Help Artem find any initial matrix that will match the experiment results. It is guaranteed that experiment data is consistent, which means at least one valid matrix exists.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains three integers *n*, *m* and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100,<=1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=10<=000)\u00a0\u2014 dimensions of the matrix and the number of turns in the experiment, respectively.\n\nNext *q* lines contain turns descriptions, one per line.

For the operation of first and second type integer *r**i* (1<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) or *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=*m*) follows, while for the operations of the third type three integers *r**i*, *c**i* and *x**i* (1<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, 1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=*m*, <=-<=109<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=109) are given.\n\nOperation of the first type (*t**i*<==<=1) means that signal comes to the input corresponding to row *r**i*, that is it will shift cyclically. Operation of the second type (*t**i*<==<=2) means that column *c**i* will shift cyclically. Finally, operation of the third type means that at this moment of time cell located in the row *r**i* and column *c**i* stores value *x**i*..

As all rights on its name belong to Pineapple, they stand on changing the name of Gogol's artificial intelligence.\n\nPineapple insists, that the name of their phone occurs in the name of AI as a substring. Because the name of technology was already printed on all devices, the Gogol's director decided to replace some characters in AI name with \"#\". As this operation is pretty expensive, you should find the minimum number of characters to replace with \"#\", such that the name of AI doesn't contain the name of the phone as a substring.\n\nSubstring is a continuous subsequence of a string.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains the name of AI designed by Gogol, its length doesn't exceed 100<=000 characters. Second line contains the name of the phone released by Pineapple 200 years ago, its length doesn't exceed 30. Both string are non-empty and consist of only small English letters.. Output specification: Print the minimum number of characters that must be replaced with \"#\" in order to obtain that the name of the phone doesn't occur in the name of AI as a substring.\nDemo input: ['intellect\\ntell\\n', 'google\\napple\\n', 'sirisiri\\nsir\\n'], Demo output: ['1', '0', '2']\nNote: In the first sample AI's name may be replaced with \"int#llect\".\n\nIn the second sample Gogol can just keep things as they are.\n\nIn the third sample one of the new possible names of AI may be \"s#ris#ri\"."}]}}

This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple.

Write a python script for the following problem: You know that Japan is the country with almost the largest 'electronic devices per person' ratio. So you might be quite surprised to find out that the primary school in Japan teaches to count using a Soroban \u2014 an abacus developed in Japan. This phenomenon has its reasons, of course, but we are not going to speak about them. Let's have a look at the Soroban's construction.\n\nSoroban consists of some number of rods, each rod contains five beads. We will assume that the rods are horizontal lines. One bead on each rod (the leftmost one) is divided from the others by a bar (the reckoning bar). This single bead is called go-dama and four others are ichi-damas. Each rod is responsible for representing a single digit from 0 to 9. We can obtain the value of a digit by following simple algorithm:\n -  Set the value of a digit equal to 0. -  If the go-dama is shifted to the right, add 5. -  Add the number of ichi-damas shifted to the left. \nThus, the upper rod on the picture shows digit 0, the middle one shows digit 2 and the lower one shows 7. We will consider the top rod to represent the last decimal digit of a number, so the picture shows number 720.\n\nWrite the program that prints the way Soroban shows the given number *n*.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=&lt;<=109).. Output specification: Print the description of the decimal digits of number *n* from the last one to the first one (as mentioned on the picture in the statement), one per line. Print the beads as large English letters 'O', rod pieces as character '-' and the reckoning bar as '|'. Print as many rods, as many digits are in the decimal representation of number *n* without leading zeroes. We can assume that number 0 has no leading zeroes.\nDemo input: ['2\\n', '13\\n', '720\\n'], Demo output: ['O-|OO-OO\\n', 'O-|OOO-O\\nO-|O-OOO\\n', 'O-|-OOOO\\nO-|OO-OO\\n-O|OO-OO\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

The teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation.\n\nUnfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.\n\nNow the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers.\n\nShapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: \n -  As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. -  As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include \"-\", \";\" and \"_\". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. -  The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600 -  My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. -  Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN -  You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong. Do this by writing \"WA\" for Wrong answer or \"ACC\" for a correct answer. -  I should remind you that none of the strings (initial strings or answers) are empty. -  Finally, do these as soon as possible. You have less than 2 hours to complete this.\nInput specification: The first three lines contain a string each. These are the initial strings. They consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). All the initial strings have length from 1 to 100, inclusively.\n\nIn the fourth line there is a single integer *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000), the number of students.\n\nNext *n* lines contain a student's answer each. It is guaranteed that the answer meets what the teacher said. Each answer iconsists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). Length is from 1 to 600, inclusively.. Output specification: For each student write in a different line.

By the 11th grade they managed to play all the games of this type and asked Vova the programmer to come up with a new game. Vova suggested to them to play a game under the code name \"dot\" with the following rules: \n-  On the checkered paper a coordinate system is drawn. A dot is initially put in the position (*x*,<=*y*). -  A move is shifting a dot to one of the pre-selected vectors. Also each player can once per game symmetrically reflect a dot relatively to the line *y*<==<=*x*. -  Anton and Dasha take turns. Anton goes first. -  The player after whose move the distance from the dot to the coordinates' origin exceeds *d*, loses. \nHelp them to determine the winner.\nInput specification: The first line of the input file contains 4 integers *x*, *y*, *n*, *d* (<=-<=200<=\u2264<=*x*,<=*y*<=\u2264<=200,<=1<=\u2264<=*d*<=\u2264<=200,<=1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=20) \u2014 the initial coordinates of the dot, the distance *d* and the number of vectors.

Write a python script for the following problem: After the contest in comparing numbers, Shapur's teacher found out that he is a real genius and that no one could possibly do the calculations faster than him even using a super computer!\n\nSome days before the contest, the teacher took a very simple-looking exam and all his *n* students took part in the exam. The teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation.\n\nUnfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.\n\nNow the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers.\n\nShapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: \n -  As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. -  As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include \"-\", \";\" and \"_\". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. -  The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600 -  My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. -  Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN -  You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong. Do this by writing \"WA\" for Wrong answer or \"ACC\" for a correct answer. -  I should remind you that none of the strings (initial strings or answers) are empty. -  Finally, do these as soon as possible. You have less than 2 hours to complete this.\nInput specification: The first three lines contain a string each. These are the initial strings. They consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). All the initial strings have length from 1 to 100, inclusively.\n\nIn the fourth line there is a single integer *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000), the number of students.\n\nNext *n* lines contain a student's answer each. It is guaranteed that the answer meets what the teacher said. Each answer iconsists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). Length is from 1 to 600, inclusively.. Output specification: For each student write in a different line. Print \"WA\" if his answer is wrong or \"ACC\" if his answer is OK.\nDemo input: ['Iran_\\nPersian;\\nW_o;n;d;e;r;f;u;l;\\n7\\nWonderfulPersianIran\\nwonderful_PersIAN_IRAN;;_\\nWONDERFUL___IRAN__PERSIAN__;;\\nIra__Persiann__Wonderful\\nWonder;;fulPersian___;I;r;a;n;\\n__________IranPersianWonderful__________\\nPersianIran_is_Wonderful\\n', 'Shapur;;\\nis___\\na_genius\\n3\\nShapur__a_is___geniUs\\nis___shapur___a__Genius;\\nShapur;;is;;a;;geni;;us;;\\n'], Demo output: ['ACC\\nACC\\nACC\\nWA\\nACC\\nACC\\nWA\\n', 'WA\\nACC\\nACC\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture.

Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: By 2312 there were *n* Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*).. Output specification: Print *m* lines \u2014 the results of executing requests in the above given format. The requests should be processed in the order, in which they are given in the input.

Write a python script for the following problem: You're a mikemon breeder currently in the middle of your journey to become a mikemon master. Your current obstacle is go through the infamous Biridian Forest.\n\nThe forest\n\nThe Biridian Forest is a two-dimensional grid consisting of *r* rows and *c* columns. Each cell in Biridian Forest may contain a tree, or may be vacant. A vacant cell may be occupied by zero or more mikemon breeders (there may also be breeders other than you in the forest). Mikemon breeders (including you) cannot enter cells with trees. One of the cells is designated as the exit cell.\n\nThe initial grid, including your initial position, the exit cell, and the initial positions of all other breeders, will be given to you. Here's an example of such grid (from the first example):\n\nMoves\n\nBreeders (including you) may move in the forest. In a single move, breeders may perform one of the following actions: \n -  Do nothing. -  Move from the current cell to one of the four adjacent cells (two cells are adjacent if they share a side). Note that breeders cannot enter cells with trees. -  If you are located on the exit cell, you may leave the forest. Only you can perform this move \u2014 all other mikemon breeders will never leave the forest by using this type of movement. \nAfter each time you make a single move, each of the other breeders simultaneously make a single move (the choice of which move to make may be different for each of the breeders).\n\nMikemon battle\n\nIf you and *t* (*t*<=&gt;<=0) mikemon breeders are located on the same cell, exactly *t* mikemon battles will ensue that time (since you will be battling each of those *t* breeders once). After the battle, all of those *t* breeders will leave the forest to heal their respective mikemons.\n\nNote that the moment you leave the forest, no more mikemon battles can ensue, even if another mikemon breeder move to the exit cell immediately after that. Also note that a battle only happens between you and another breeders \u2014 there will be no battle between two other breeders (there may be multiple breeders coexisting in a single cell).\n\nYour goal\n\nYou would like to leave the forest. In order to do so, you have to make a sequence of moves, ending with a move of the final type. Before you make any move, however, you post this sequence on your personal virtual idol Blog. Then, you will follow this sequence of moves faithfully.\n\nGoal of other breeders\n\nBecause you post the sequence in your Blog, the other breeders will all know your exact sequence of moves even before you make your first move. All of them will move in such way that will guarantee a mikemon battle with you, if possible. The breeders that couldn't battle you will do nothing.\n\nYour task\n\nPrint the minimum number of mikemon battles that you must participate in, assuming that you pick the sequence of moves that minimize this number. Note that you are not required to minimize the number of moves you make.\nInput specification: The first line consists of two integers: *r* and *c* (1<=\u2264<=*r*,<=*c*<=\u2264<=1000), denoting the number of rows and the number of columns in Biridian Forest. The next *r* rows will each depict a row of the map, where each character represents the content of a single cell: \n -  'T': A cell occupied by a tree. -  'S': An empty cell, and your starting position. There will be exactly one occurence of this in the map. -  'E': An empty cell, and where the exit is located. There will be exactly one occurence of this in the map. -  A digit (0-9): A cell represented by a digit X means that the cell is empty and is occupied by X breeders (in particular, if X is zero, it means that the cell is not occupied by any breeder). \nIt is guaranteed that it will be possible for you to go from your starting position to the exit cell through a sequence of moves.. Output specification: A single line denoted the minimum possible number of mikemon battles that you have to participate in if you pick a strategy that minimize this number.\nDemo input: ['5 7\\n000E0T3\\nT0TT0T0\\n010T0T0\\n2T0T0T0\\n0T0S000\\n', '1 4\\nSE23\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: The following picture illustrates the first example. The blue line denotes a possible sequence of moves that you should post in your blog:\n\nThe three breeders on the left side of the map will be able to battle you \u2014 the lone breeder can simply stay in his place until you come while the other two breeders can move to where the lone breeder is and stay there until you come. The three breeders on the right does not have a way to battle you, so they will stay in their place.\n\nFor the second example, you should post this sequence in your Blog:\n\nHere's what happens. First, you move one cell to the right.\n\nThen, the two breeders directly to the right of the exit will simultaneously move to the left. The other three breeder cannot battle you so they will do nothing.\n\nYou end up in the same cell with 2 breeders, so 2 mikemon battles are conducted. After those battles, all of your opponents leave the forest.\n\nFinally, you make another move by leaving the forest."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: In a far away kingdom lived the King, the Prince, the Shoemaker, the Dressmaker and many other citizens. They lived happily until great trouble came into the Kingdom. The ACMers settled there.\n\nMost damage those strange creatures inflicted upon the kingdom was that they loved high precision numbers. As a result, the Kingdom healers had already had three appointments with the merchants who were asked to sell, say, exactly 0.273549107 beer barrels. To deal with the problem somehow, the King issued an order obliging rounding up all numbers to the closest integer to simplify calculations. Specifically, the order went like this:\n-  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is strictly less than 0.5, then the rounded up number coincides with the number\u2019s integer part. -  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is not less than 0.5, the rounded up number is obtained if we add 1 to the last digit of the number\u2019s integer part.-  If the number\u2019s integer part ends with digit 9, to round up the numbers one should go to Vasilisa the Wise. In the whole Kingdom she is the only one who can perform the tricky operation of carrying into the next position. \nMerchants found the algorithm very sophisticated and they asked you (the ACMers) to help them. Can you write a program that would perform the rounding according to the King\u2019s order?\nInput specification: The first line contains a single number to round up \u2014 the integer part (a non-empty set of decimal digits that do not start with 0 \u2014 with the exception of a case when the set consists of a single digit \u2014 in this case 0 can go first), then follows character \u00ab.\u00bb (a dot), and then follows the fractional part (any non-empty set of decimal digits).

He decided to eat an equal amount of candies each morning until there are no more candies. However, Petya also noticed the box and decided to get some candies for himself.\n\nThis means the process of eating candies is the following: in the beginning Vasya chooses a single integer $k$, same for all days. After that, in the morning he eats $k$ candies from the box (if there are less than $k$ candies in the box, he eats them all), then in the evening Petya eats $10\\%$ of the candies remaining in the box. If there are still candies left in the box, the process repeats\u00a0\u2014 next day Vasya eats $k$ candies again, and Petya\u00a0\u2014 $10\\%$ of the candies left in a box, and so on.\n\nIf the amount of candies in the box is not divisible by $10$, Petya rounds the amount he takes from the box down. For example, if there were $97$ candies in the box, Petya would eat only $9$ of them. In particular, if there are less than $10$ candies in a box, Petya won't eat any at all.\n\nYour task is to find out the minimal amount of $k$ that can be chosen by Vasya so that he would eat at least half of the $n$ candies he initially got. Note that the number $k$ must be integer.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{18}$)\u00a0\u2014 the initial amount of candies in the box..

Like all the sharks, she has several rows of teeth, and feeds on crucians. One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are \"relaxing\".\n\nFor a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap).\n\nIt turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again. \n\nUnhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her. For sure, the shark couldn't say no to her favourite meal, but she had no desire to go back to the dentist. That's why she decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that the viability of no tooth becomes negative. \n\nAs Valerie is not good at mathematics, she asked you to help her to find out the total amount of crucians that she can consume for dinner.\n\nWe should remind you that while eating one crucian Valerie uses exactly one row of teeth and the viability of each tooth from this row decreases by one.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000,<=0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 total amount of Valerie's teeth, amount of tooth rows and amount of crucians in Valerie's portion for dinner.

Write a python script for the following problem: After the big birthday party, Katie still wanted Shiro to have some more fun. Later, she came up with a game called treasure hunt. Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\n\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.. Output specification: Print the name of the winner (\"Kuro\", \"Shiro\" or \"Katie\"). If there are at least two cats that share the maximum beauty, print \"Draw\".\nDemo input: ['3\\nKuroo\\nShiro\\nKatie\\n', '7\\ntreasurehunt\\nthreefriends\\nhiCodeforces\\n', '1\\nabcabc\\ncbabac\\nababca\\n', '15\\nfoPaErcvJ\\nmZaxowpbt\\nmkuOlaHRE\\n'], Demo output: ['Kuro\\n', 'Shiro\\n', 'Katie\\n', 'Draw\\n']\nNote: In the first example, after $3$ turns, Kuro can change his ribbon into ooooo, which has the beauty of $5$, while reaching such beauty for Shiro and Katie is impossible (both Shiro and Katie can reach the beauty of at most $4$, for example by changing Shiro's ribbon into SSiSS and changing Katie's ribbon into Kaaaa). Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice. Therefore, the game ends in a draw."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Bob is a farmer. He has a large pasture with many sheep. Recently, he has lost some of them due to wolf attacks. He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of dogs.\nDemo input: ['6 6\\n..S...\\n..S.W.\\n.S....\\n..W...\\n...W..\\n......\\n', '1 2\\nSW\\n', '5 5\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS....\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n..SD..\\n..SDW.\\n.SD...\\n.DW...\\nDD.W..\\n......\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS.D..\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n']\nNote: In the first example, we can split the pasture into two halves, one containing wolves and one containing sheep. Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

It's known that any two computers connected by cable directly or through other computers\n\nPolycarpus decided to find out the network's topology. A network topology is the way of describing the network configuration, the scheme that shows the location and the connections of network devices.\n\nPolycarpus knows three main network topologies: bus, ring and star. A bus is the topology that represents a shared cable with all computers connected with it. In the ring topology the cable connects each computer only with two other ones. A star is the topology where all computers of a network are connected to the single central node.\n\nLet's represent each of these network topologies as a connected non-directed graph. A bus is a connected graph that is the only path, that is, the graph where all nodes are connected with two other ones except for some two nodes that are the beginning and the end of the path. A ring is a connected graph, where all nodes are connected with two other ones. A star is a connected graph, where a single central node is singled out and connected with all other nodes. For clarifications, see the picture.\n\nYou've got a connected non-directed graph that characterizes the computer network in Polycarpus' corporation.

Write a python script for the following problem: Today Sonya learned about long integers and invited all her friends to share the fun. Sonya has an initially empty multiset with integers. Friends give her *t* queries, each of one of the following type:\n 1.  <=+<= *a**i*\u00a0\u2014 add non-negative integer *a**i* to the multiset. Note, that she has a multiset, thus there may be many occurrences of the same integer. 1.  <=-<= *a**i*\u00a0\u2014 delete a single occurrence of non-negative integer *a**i* from the multiset. It's guaranteed, that there is at least one *a**i* in the multiset. 1.  ? *s*\u00a0\u2014 count the number of integers in the multiset (with repetitions) that match some pattern *s* consisting of 0 and 1. In the pattern, 0 stands for the even digits, while 1 stands for the odd. Integer *x* matches the pattern *s*, if the parity of the *i*-th from the right digit in decimal notation matches the *i*-th from the right digit of the pattern. If the pattern is shorter than this integer, it's supplemented with 0-s from the left. Similarly, if the integer is shorter than the pattern its decimal notation is supplemented with the 0-s from the left. \nFor example, if the pattern is *s*<==<=010, than integers 92, 2212, 50 and 414 match the pattern, while integers 3, 110, 25 and 1030 do not.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains an integer *t* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of operation Sonya has to perform.\n\nNext *t* lines provide the descriptions of the queries in order they appear in the input file. The *i*-th row starts with a character *c**i*\u00a0\u2014 the type of the corresponding operation.

But it turns out to be pretty hard for her, because she is too young. Therefore, her brother Sergey always helps her.\n\nSergey gives Nastya the word *t* and wants to get the word *p* out of it. Nastya removes letters in a certain order (one after another, in this order strictly), which is specified by permutation of letters' indices of the word *t*: *a*1... *a*|*t*|.

For example, if *t*<==<=\"nastya\" and *a*<==<=[4,<=1,<=5,<=3,<=2,<=6] then removals make the following sequence of words \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\".\n\nSergey knows this permutation.

These sections are connected by a chain: the 1-st section is adjacent only to the 2-nd one, the 2-nd one \u2014 to the 1-st and the 3-rd ones, the 3-rd one \u2014 only to the 2-nd one. The transitions are possible only between the adjacent sections.\n\nThe spacecraft team consists of *n* aliens. Each of them is given a rank \u2014 an integer from 1 to *n*. The ranks of all astronauts are distinct. The rules established on the Saucer, state that an alien may move from section *a* to section *b* only if it is senior in rank to all aliens who are in the segments *a* and *b* (besides, the segments *a* and *b* are of course required to be adjacent). Any alien requires exactly 1 minute to make a move. Besides, safety regulations require that no more than one alien moved at the same minute along the ship.\n\nAlien *A* is senior in rank to alien *B*, if the number indicating rank *A*, is more than the corresponding number for *B*.\n\nAt the moment the whole saucer team is in the 3-rd segment.

One member of the crew, the alien with the identification number CFR-140, decided to calculate the minimum time (in minutes) they will need to perform this task.\n\nHelp CFR-140, figure out the minimum time (in minutes) that all the astronauts will need to move from the 3-rd segment to the 1-st one.

Write a python script for the following problem: Vasya studies music. \n\nHe has learned lots of interesting stuff. For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\n\nVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads \u2014 major and minor.\n\nLet's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes *X*, *Y* and *Z*. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between *X* and *Y* equals 4 semitones and the distance between *Y* and *Z* is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between *X* and *Z*, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.\n\nA minor triad is different in that the distance between *X* and *Y* should be 3 semitones and between *Y* and *Z* \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nFor example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nHelp Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\nInput specification: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.. Output specification: Print \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\nDemo input: ['C E G\\n', 'C# B F\\n', 'A B H\\n'], Demo output: ['major\\n', 'minor\\n', 'strange\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

To stay informed about the servers' performance, Polycarpus executes commands \"ping a\" and \"ping b\". Each ping command sends exactly ten packets to the server specified in the argument of the command. Executing a program results in two integers *x* and *y* (*x*<=+<=*y*<==<=10;\u00a0*x*,<=*y*<=\u2265<=0). These numbers mean that *x* packets successfully reached the corresponding server through the network and *y* packets were lost.\n\nToday Polycarpus has performed overall *n* ping commands during his workday. Now for each server Polycarpus wants to know whether the server is \"alive\" or not.

Usually a launched firework flies vertically upward for some period of time, then explodes, splitting into several parts flying in different directions. Sometimes those parts also explode after some period of time, splitting into even more parts, and so on.\n\nLimak, who lives in an infinite grid, has a single firework. The behaviour of the firework is described with a recursion depth *n* and a duration for each level of recursion *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n*. Once Limak launches the firework in some cell, the firework starts moving upward. After covering *t*1 cells (including the starting cell), it explodes and splits into two parts, each moving in the direction changed by 45 degrees (see the pictures below for clarification). So, one part moves in the top-left direction, while the other one moves in the top-right direction. Each part explodes again after covering *t*2 cells, splitting into two parts moving in directions again changed by 45 degrees. The process continues till the *n*-th level of recursion, when all 2*n*<=-<=1 existing parts explode and disappear without creating new parts. After a few levels of recursion, it's possible that some parts will be at the same place and at the same time\u00a0\u2014 it is allowed and such parts do not crash.\n\nBefore launching the firework, Limak must make sure that nobody stands in cells which will be visited at least once by the firework.

Limak launched the firework from the bottom-most red cell. It covered *t*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>\u2009=\u20094 cells (marked red), exploded and divided into two parts (their further movement is marked green). All explosions are marked with an 'X' character. On the last drawing, there are 4 red, 4 green, 8 orange and 23 pink cells.

Tonight there will be a chest with brains on display and every attendee sees how many there are. These will then be split among the attendees according to the following procedure:\n\nThe zombie of the highest rank makes a suggestion on who gets how many brains (every brain is an indivisible entity). A vote follows. If at least half of the attendees accept the offer, the brains are shared in the suggested way and the feast begins. But if majority is not reached, then the highest-ranked zombie is killed, and the next zombie in hierarchy has to make a suggestion. If he is killed too, then the third highest-ranked makes one, etc. (It's enough to have exactly half of the votes \u2013 in case of a tie, the vote of the highest-ranked alive zombie counts twice, and he will of course vote in favor of his own suggestion in order to stay alive.)\n\nYou should know that zombies are very greedy and sly, and they know this too \u2013 basically all zombie brains are alike. Consequently, a zombie will never accept an offer which is suboptimal for him. That is, if an offer is not strictly better than a potential later offer, he will vote against it. And make no mistake: while zombies may normally seem rather dull, tonight their intellects are perfect. Each zombie's priorities for tonight are, in descending order: \n 1.  survive the event (they experienced death already once and know it is no fun), 1.  get as many brains as possible. \nHeidi goes first and must make an offer which at least half of the attendees will accept, and which allocates at least one brain for Heidi herself.\n\nWhat is the smallest number of brains that have to be in the chest for this to be possible?\nInput specification: The only line of input contains one integer: *N*, the number of attendees (1<=\u2264<=*N*<=\u2264<=109)..

For each person we know the arrival time: the *i*-th person comes exactly at *h**i* hours *m**i* minutes. The cafe spends less than a minute to serve each client, but if a client comes in and sees that there is no free cash, than he doesn't want to wait and leaves the cafe immediately. \n\nValera is very greedy, so he wants to serve all *n* customers next day (and get more profit). However, for that he needs to ensure that at each moment of time the number of working cashes is no less than the number of clients in the cafe. \n\nHelp Valera count the minimum number of cashes to work at his cafe next day, so that they can serve all visitors.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105), that is the number of cafe visitors.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines has two space-separated integers *h**i* and *m**i* (0<=\u2264<=*h**i*<=\u2264<=23;\u00a00<=\u2264<=*m**i*<=\u2264<=59), representing the time when the *i*-th person comes into the cafe. \n\nNote that the time is given in the chronological order.

Write a python script for the following problem: Vasya learns to type. He has an unusual keyboard at his disposal: it is rectangular and it has *n* rows of keys containing *m* keys in each row. Besides, the keys are of two types. Some of the keys have lowercase Latin letters on them and some of the keys work like the \"Shift\" key on standard keyboards, that is, they make lowercase letters uppercase.\n\nVasya can press one or two keys with one hand. However, he can only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the keys does not exceed *x*. The keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.\n\nVasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest \"Shift\" key is strictly larger than *x*. In this case he will have to use his other hand. Having typed the symbol, Vasya returns other hand back to the chips.\n\nYou are given Vasya's keyboard and the text. Count the minimum number of times Vasya will have to use the other hand.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *x* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=30,<=1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=50).\n\nNext *n* lines contain descriptions of all the keyboard keys. Each line contains the descriptions of exactly *m* keys, without spaces. The letter keys are marked with the corresponding lowercase letters. The \"Shift\" keys are marked with the \"S\" symbol. \n\nThen follow the length of the text *q* (1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=5\u00b7105). The last line contains the text *T*, which consists of *q* symbols, which are uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.. Output specification: If Vasya can type the text, then print the minimum number of times he will have to use his other hand. Otherwise, print \"-1\" (without the quotes).\nDemo input: ['2 2 1\\nab\\ncd\\n1\\nA\\n', '2 2 1\\nab\\ncd\\n1\\ne\\n', '2 2 1\\nab\\ncS\\n5\\nabcBA\\n', '3 9 4\\nqwertyuio\\nasdfghjkl\\nSzxcvbnmS\\n35\\nTheQuIcKbRoWnFOXjummsovertHeLazYDOG\\n'], Demo output: ['-1\\n', '-1\\n', '1\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: In the first sample the symbol \"A\" is impossible to print as there's no \"Shift\" key on the keyboard.\n\nIn the second sample the symbol \"e\" is impossible to print as there's no such key on the keyboard.\n\nIn the fourth sample the symbols \"T\", \"G\" are impossible to print with one hand.

Therefore, your task is to find three distinct numbers (*a*,<=*b*,<=*c*), for which the statement is false, and the numbers meet the condition *l*<=\u2264<=*a*<=&lt;<=*b*<=&lt;<=*c*<=\u2264<=*r*. \n\nMore specifically, you need to find three numbers (*a*,<=*b*,<=*c*), such that *l*<=\u2264<=*a*<=&lt;<=*b*<=&lt;<=*c*<=\u2264<=*r*, pairs (*a*,<=*b*) and (*b*,<=*c*) are coprime, and pair (*a*,<=*c*) is not coprime.\nInput specification: The single line contains two positive space-separated integers *l*, *r* (1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=*r*<=\u2264<=1018; *r*<=-<=*l*<=\u2264<=50)..

Write a python script for the following problem: After the big birthday party, Katie still wanted Shiro to have some more fun. Later, she came up with a game called treasure hunt. Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\n\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.. Output specification: Print the name of the winner (\"Kuro\", \"Shiro\" or \"Katie\"). If there are at least two cats that share the maximum beauty, print \"Draw\".\nDemo input: ['3\\nKuroo\\nShiro\\nKatie\\n', '7\\ntreasurehunt\\nthreefriends\\nhiCodeforces\\n', '1\\nabcabc\\ncbabac\\nababca\\n', '15\\nfoPaErcvJ\\nmZaxowpbt\\nmkuOlaHRE\\n'], Demo output: ['Kuro\\n', 'Shiro\\n', 'Katie\\n', 'Draw\\n']\nNote: In the first example, after $3$ turns, Kuro can change his ribbon into ooooo, which has the beauty of $5$, while reaching such beauty for Shiro and Katie is impossible (both Shiro and Katie can reach the beauty of at most $4$, for example by changing Shiro's ribbon into SSiSS and changing Katie's ribbon into Kaaaa). Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice. Therefore, the game ends in a draw."}]}}

However, Vasilisa the Wise does not know what the box's secret is, since she cannot open it again.

The example of a lock is given on the picture below.\n\nThe box is accompanied with 9 gems.

The box will only open after it is decorated with gems correctly: that is, each deepening in the lock should be filled with exactly one gem. Also, the sums of numbers in the square's rows, columns and two diagonals of the square should match the numbers written at the lock's edge. For example, the above lock will open if we fill the deepenings with gems with numbers as is shown on the picture below.\n\nNow Vasilisa the Wise wants to define, given the numbers on the box's lock, which gems she should put in the deepenings to open the box.

Write a python script for the following problem: Petya got interested in grammar on his third year in school. He invented his own language called Petya's. Petya wanted to create a maximally simple language that would be enough to chat with friends, that's why all the language's grammar can be described with the following set of rules:\n-  There are three parts of speech: the adjective, the noun, the verb. Each word in his language is an adjective, noun or verb. -  There are two genders: masculine and feminine. Each word in his language has gender either masculine or feminine. -  Masculine adjectives end with -lios, and feminine adjectives end with -liala. -  Masculine nouns end with -etr, and feminime nouns end with -etra. -  Masculine verbs end with -initis, and feminime verbs end with -inites. -  Thus, each word in the Petya's language has one of the six endings, given above. There are no other endings in Petya's language. -  It is accepted that the whole word consists of an ending. That is, words \"lios\", \"liala\", \"etr\" and so on belong to the Petya's language. -  There aren't any punctuation marks, grammatical tenses, singular/plural forms or other language complications. -  A sentence is either exactly one valid language word or exactly one statement. \nStatement is any sequence of the Petya's language, that satisfy both conditions:\n-  Words in statement follow in the following order (from the left to the right): zero or more adjectives followed by exactly one noun followed by zero or more verbs. -  All words in the statement should have the same gender.\nAfter Petya's friend Vasya wrote instant messenger (an instant messaging program) that supported the Petya's language, Petya wanted to add spelling and grammar checking to the program. As Vasya was in the country and Petya didn't feel like waiting, he asked you to help him with this problem. Your task is to define by a given sequence of words, whether it is true that the given text represents exactly one sentence in Petya's language.\nInput specification: The first line contains one or more words consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

Write a python script for the following problem: Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective.
