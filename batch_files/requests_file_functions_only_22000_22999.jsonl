Menshykov, Uslada and Horace decided to make either an elephant or a bear from those sticks. They can make an animal from sticks in the following way: \n -  Four sticks represent the animal's legs, these sticks should have the same length. -  Two remaining sticks represent the animal's head and body. The bear's head stick must be shorter than the body stick. The elephant, however, has a long trunk, so his head stick must be as long as the body stick.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the elements of array. \n\nThe third line contains integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs. Separate the numbers by spaces.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nDemo input: ['2\\n1 2\\n1\\n1\\n', '2\\n2 1\\n1\\n1\\n', '3\\n3 1 2\\n3\\n1 2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['1 2\\n', '2 1\\n', '6 6\\n']\nNote: In the first sample Vasya's approach will make one comparison (it starts with the 1-st element and immediately finds the required number), and Petya's approach makes two comparisons (first he compares with the 2-nd array element, doesn't find the search item and compares with the 1-st element).\n\nIn the second sample, on the contrary, Vasya's approach will need two comparisons (first with 1-st element, and then with the 2-nd), and Petya's approach will find the required value in one comparison (the first comparison with the 2-nd element)."}]}}

You can go from the first room to the second room, from the second room to the third room and so on \u2014 you can go from the (*n*<=-<=1)-th room to the *n*-th room. Thus, you can go to room *x* only from room *x*<=-<=1.\n\nThe potato pie is located in the *n*-th room and Vitaly needs to go there. \n\nEach pair of consecutive rooms has a door between them. In order to go to room *x* from room *x*<=-<=1, you need to open the door between the rooms with the corresponding key. \n\nIn total the house has several types of doors (represented by uppercase Latin letters) and several types of keys (represented by lowercase Latin letters). The key of type *t* can open the door of type *T* if and only if *t* and *T* are the same letter, written in different cases. For example, key f can open door F.\n\nEach of the first *n*<=-<=1 rooms contains exactly one key of some type that Vitaly can use to get to next rooms. Once the door is open with some key, Vitaly won't get the key from the keyhole but he will immediately run into the next room. In other words, each key can open no more than one door.\n\nVitaly realizes that he may end up in some room without the key that opens the door to the next room. Before the start his run for the potato pie Vitaly can buy any number of keys of any type that is guaranteed to get to room *n*.\n\nGiven the plan of the house, Vitaly wants to know what is the minimum number of keys he needs to buy to surely get to the room *n*, which has a delicious potato pie. Write a program that will help Vitaly find out this number.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains a positive integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the number of rooms in the house.\n\nThe second line of the input contains string *s* of length 2\u00b7*n*<=-<=2. Let's number the elements of the string from left to right, starting from one. \n\nThe odd positions in the given string *s* contain lowercase Latin letters\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the types of the keys that lie in the corresponding rooms. Thus, each odd position *i* of the given string *s* contains a lowercase Latin letter \u2014 the type of the key that lies in room number (*i*<=+<=1)<=/<=2.\n\nThe even positions in the given string contain uppercase Latin letters \u2014 the types of doors between the rooms. Thus, each even position *i* of the given string *s* contains an uppercase letter \u2014 the type of the door that leads from room *i*<=/<=2 to room *i*<=/<=2<=+<=1.. Output specification: Print the only integer \u2014 the minimum number of keys that Vitaly needs to buy to surely get from room one to room *n*.\nDemo input: ['3\\naAbB\\n', '4\\naBaCaB\\n', '5\\nxYyXzZaZ\\n'], Demo output: ['0\\n', '3\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Imagine that you have a twin brother or sister. Having another person that looks exactly like you seems very unusual. It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.\n\nNow let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins. The second line contains a sequence of *n* integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the coins' values. All numbers are separated with spaces..

If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too. You can pick coins with values 1,\u20092 or 2,\u20092. In any case, the minimum number of coins equals 2."}]}}

In other words, difficulty equals the maximum distance between two holds that are adjacent in height.\n\nToday Mike decided to cover the track with holds hanging on heights *a*1, ..., *a**n*. To make the problem harder, Mike decided to remove one hold, that is, remove one element of the sequence (for example, if we take the sequence (1,<=2,<=3,<=4,<=5) and remove the third element from it, we obtain the sequence (1,<=2,<=4,<=5)). However, as Mike is awful at climbing, he wants the final difficulty (i.e. the maximum difference of heights between adjacent holds after removing the hold) to be as small as possible among all possible options of removing a hold.

Write a python script for the following problem: By 2312 there were *n* Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*)..

The only difference is that when a billiard ball hits the board's border, it can reflect from it and continue moving.\n\nMore formally, first one of four diagonal directions is chosen and the billiard ball moves in that direction. When it reaches the square located on the board's edge, the billiard ball reflects from it; it changes the direction of its movement by 90 degrees and continues moving. Specifically, having reached a corner square, the billiard ball is reflected twice and starts to move the opposite way. While it moves, the billiard ball can make an infinite number of reflections. At any square of its trajectory the billiard ball can stop and on that the move is considered completed.\n\nIt is considered that one billiard ball *a* beats another billiard ball *b* if *a* can reach a point where *b* is located.\n\nYou are suggested to find the maximal number of billiard balls, that pairwise do not beat each other and that can be positioned on a chessboard *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* in size.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=106)..

The function *s*(*t*) is correct if it's obtained by one of the following rules: \n1.  *s*(*t*)<==<=*abs*(*w*(*t*)), where *abs*(*x*) means taking the absolute value of a number *x*, i.e. |*x*|;1.  *s*(*t*)<==<=(*w*(*t*)<=+<=*h*(*t*));1.  *s*(*t*)<==<=(*w*(*t*)<=-<=*h*(*t*));1.  *s*(*t*)<==<=(*w*(*t*)<=*<=*h*(*t*)), where <=*<= means multiplication, i.e. (*w*(*t*)\u00b7*h*(*t*));1.  *s*(*t*)<==<=*c*;1.  *s*(*t*)<==<=*t*;\nYesterday Ruslan thought on and on, but he could not cope with the task. Now he asks you to write a program that computes the appropriate *f*(*t*) and *g*(*t*) for any set of at most 50 circles.\n\nIn each of the functions *f*(*t*) and *g*(*t*) you are allowed to use no more than 50 multiplications. The length of any function should not exceed 100\u00b7*n* characters. The function should not contain spaces.\n\nRuslan can't keep big numbers in his memory, so you should choose *f*(*t*) and *g*(*t*), such that for all integer *t* from 0 to 50 value of *f*(*t*) and *g*(*t*) and all the intermediate calculations won't exceed 109 by their absolute value.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains number *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50)\u00a0\u2014 the number of circles Ruslan thinks of. Next follow *n* lines, each of them containing three integers *x**i*, *y**i* and *r**i* (0<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=50, 2<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=50)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the center and the raduis of the *i*-th circle.. Output specification: In the first line print a correct function *f*(*t*). In the second line print a correct function *g*(*t*). The set of the points (*x**t*<==<=*f*(*t*),<=*y**t*<==<=*g*(*t*)) (0<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=50) must satisfy the condition, that there is at least one point inside or on the border of each of the circles, Ruslan thinks of at the beginning.\nDemo input: ['3\\n0 10 4\\n10 0 4\\n20 10 4\\n'], Demo output: ['t \\nabs((t-10))']\nNote: Correct functions:\n1.  101.  (1+2)1.  ((*t*-3)+(*t**4))1.  *abs*((*t*-10))1.  (*abs*((((23-*t*)*(*t***t*))+((45+12)*(*t***t*))))*((5**t*)+((12**t*)-13)))1.  *abs*((*t*-(*abs*((*t**31))+14))))\nIncorrect functions:\n1.  3+5+7 (not enough brackets, it should be ((3+5)+7) or (3+(5+7))) 1.  *abs*(*t*-3) (not enough brackets, it should be *abs*((*t*-3))1.  2+(2-3 (one bracket too many)1.  1(*t*+5) (no arithmetic operation between 1 and the bracket)1.  5000*5000 (the number exceeds the maximum)"}]}}

Limak can perform them in any order, any operation may be applied any number of times. The *i*-th operation is described by a string *a**i* of length two and a string *b**i* of length one. No two of *q* possible operations have the same string *a**i*.\n\nWhen Limak has a string *s* he can perform the *i*-th operation on *s* if the first two letters of *s* match a two-letter string *a**i*. Performing the *i*-th operation removes first two letters of *s* and inserts there a string *b**i*. See the notes section for further clarification.\n\nYou may note that performing an operation decreases the length of a string *s* exactly by 1. Also, for some sets of operations there may be a string that cannot be compressed any further, because the first two letters don't match any *a**i*.\n\nLimak wants to start with a string of length *n* and perform *n*<=-<=1 operations to finally get a one-letter string \"a\". In how many ways can he choose the starting string to be able to get \"a\"?

Gerald has almost won, and the only thing he needs to win is to bring the pawn from the upper left corner of the board, where it is now standing, to the lower right corner. Gerald is so confident of victory that he became interested, in how many ways can he win?\n\nThe pawn, which Gerald has got left can go in two ways: one cell down or one cell to the right. In addition, it can not go to the black cells, otherwise the Gerald still loses. There are no other pawns or pieces left on the field, so that, according to the rules of giant chess Gerald moves his pawn until the game is over, and Pollard is just watching this process.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains three integers: *h*,<=*w*,<=*n* \u2014 the sides of the board and the number of black cells (1<=\u2264<=*h*,<=*w*<=\u2264<=105,<=1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2000). \n\nNext *n* lines contain the description of black cells. The *i*-th of these lines contains numbers *r**i*,<=*c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*h*,<=1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=*w*) \u2014 the number of the row and column of the *i*-th cell.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the upper left and lower right cell are white and all cells in the description are distinct.. Output specification: Print a single line \u2014 the remainder of the number of ways to move Gerald's pawn from the upper left to the lower right corner modulo 109<=+<=7.\nDemo input: ['3 4 2\\n2 2\\n2 3\\n', '100 100 3\\n15 16\\n16 15\\n99 88\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '545732279\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

For example, the Hamming distance between words \"permanent\" and \"pergament\" is two, as these words differ in the fourth and sixth letters.\n\nMoreover, as he was searching for information, he also noticed that modern search engines have powerful mechanisms to correct errors in the request to improve the quality of search. Ford doesn't know much about human beings, so he assumed that the most common mistake in a request is swapping two arbitrary letters of the string (not necessarily adjacent). Now he wants to write a function that determines which two letters should be swapped in string *S*, so that the Hamming distance between a new string *S* and string *T* would be as small as possible, or otherwise, determine that such a replacement cannot reduce the distance between the strings.\n\nHelp him do this!\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200<=000) \u2014 the length of strings *S* and *T*.\n\nThe second line contains string *S*.\n\nThe third line contains string *T*.\n\nEach of the lines only contains lowercase Latin letters..

Write a python script for the following problem: Little Petya is learning to play chess. He has already learned how to move a king, a rook and a bishop. Let us remind you the rules of moving chess pieces. A chessboard is 64 square fields organized into an 8<=\u00d7<=8 table. A field is represented by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*) \u2014 the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:\n -  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically. -  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally. -  A king moves one field in any direction \u2014 horizontally, vertically or diagonally. \nPetya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2)? At that, we assume that there are no more pieces besides this one on the board. Help him solve this problem.\nInput specification: The input contains four integers *r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2 (1<=\u2264<=*r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2<=\u2264<=8) \u2014 the coordinates of the starting and the final field.

As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ.

Write a python script for the following problem: A super computer has been built in the Turtle Academy of Sciences. The computer consists of *n*\u00b7*m*\u00b7*k* CPUs. The architecture was the paralellepiped of size *n*<=\u00d7<=*m*<=\u00d7<=*k*, split into 1<=\u00d7<=1<=\u00d7<=1 cells, each cell contains exactly one CPU. Thus, each CPU can be simultaneously identified as a group of three numbers from the layer number from 1 to *n*, the line number from 1 to *m* and the column number from 1 to *k*.\n\nIn the process of the Super Computer's work the CPUs can send each other messages by the famous turtle scheme: CPU (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*) can send messages to CPUs (*x*<=+<=1,<=*y*,<=*z*), (*x*,<=*y*<=+<=1,<=*z*) and (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*<=+<=1) (of course, if they exist), there is no feedback, that is, CPUs (*x*<=+<=1,<=*y*,<=*z*), (*x*,<=*y*<=+<=1,<=*z*) and (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*<=+<=1) cannot send messages to CPU (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*).\n\nOver time some CPUs broke down and stopped working. Such CPUs cannot send messages, receive messages or serve as intermediates in transmitting messages. We will say that CPU (*a*,<=*b*,<=*c*) controls CPU (*d*,<=*e*,<=*f*) , if there is a chain of CPUs (*x**i*,<=*y**i*,<=*z**i*), such that (*x*1<==<=*a*,<=*y*1<==<=*b*,<=*z*1<==<=*c*), (*x**p*<==<=*d*,<=*y**p*<==<=*e*,<=*z**p*<==<=*f*) (here and below *p* is the length of the chain) and the CPU in the chain with number *i* (*i*<=&lt;<=*p*) can send messages to CPU *i*<=+<=1.\n\nTurtles are quite concerned about the denial-proofness of the system of communication between the remaining CPUs.

Boosch chooses the laws to sign, he of course considers the public opinion. Allberland Public Opinion Study Centre (APOSC) conducted opinion polls among the citizens, processed the results into a report and gave it to the president.

They ascend to the top at the moment of time 32.\n\nAt the moment of time 3 a red cablecar arrives but the only student who is left doesn't like red and the cablecar leaves empty.\n\nAt the moment of time 4 a green cablecar arrives and one student from the *g* group gets on it. He ascends to top at the moment of time 34.\n\nThus, all the students are on the top, overall the ascension took exactly 34 minutes."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: After the contest in comparing numbers, Shapur's teacher found out that he is a real genius and that no one could possibly do the calculations faster than him even using a super computer!\n\nSome days before the contest, the teacher took a very simple-looking exam and all his *n* students took part in the exam. The teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation.\n\nUnfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.\n\nNow the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers.\n\nShapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: \n -  As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. -  As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include \"-\", \";\" and \"_\". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. -  The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600 -  My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. -  Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN -  You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong. Do this by writing \"WA\" for Wrong answer or \"ACC\" for a correct answer. -  I should remind you that none of the strings (initial strings or answers) are empty. -  Finally, do these as soon as possible. You have less than 2 hours to complete this.\nInput specification: The first three lines contain a string each. These are the initial strings. They consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). All the initial strings have length from 1 to 100, inclusively.\n\nIn the fourth line there is a single integer *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000), the number of students.\n\nNext *n* lines contain a student's answer each. It is guaranteed that the answer meets what the teacher said. Each answer iconsists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). Length is from 1 to 600, inclusively.. Output specification: For each student write in a different line.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$.. Output specification: Print the only integer \u2014 maximum possible total time when the lamp is lit.\nDemo input: ['3 10\\n4 6 7\\n', '2 12\\n1 10\\n', '2 7\\n3 4\\n'], Demo output: ['8\\n', '9\\n', '6\\n']\nNote: In the first example, one of possible optimal solutions is to insert value $x = 3$ before $a_1$, so program will be $[3, 4, 6, 7]$ and time of lamp being lit equals $(3 - 0) + (6 - 4) + (10 - 7) = 8$. Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$."}]}}

He has invented an algorithm and called it \"Mishka's Adjacent Replacements Algorithm\". This algorithm can be represented as a sequence of steps:\n -  Replace each occurrence of $1$ in the array $a$ with $2$; -  Replace each occurrence of $2$ in the array $a$ with $1$; -  Replace each occurrence of $3$ in the array $a$ with $4$; -  Replace each occurrence of $4$ in the array $a$ with $3$; -  Replace each occurrence of $5$ in the array $a$ with $6$; -  Replace each occurrence of $6$ in the array $a$ with $5$; -  $\\dots$ -  Replace each occurrence of $10^9 - 1$ in the array $a$ with $10^9$; -  Replace each occurrence of $10^9$ in the array $a$ with $10^9 - 1$. \nNote that the dots in the middle of this algorithm mean that Mishka applies these replacements for each pair of adjacent integers ($2i - 1, 2i$) for each $i \\in\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 5 \\cdot 10^8\\}$ as described above.\n\nFor example, for the array $a = [1, 2, 4, 5, 10]$, the following sequence of arrays represents the algorithm: \n\n$[1, 2, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $1$ with $2$) $\\rightarrow$ $[2, 2, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $2$ with $1$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $3$ with $4$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $4$ with $3$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $5$ with $6$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 6, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $6$ with $5$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ $\\dots$ $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $10$ with $9$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 9]$.

It is possible to reach each town from any other. Each road connects two towns $a$ and $b$. Kuro loves walking and he is planning to take a walking marathon, in which he will choose a pair of towns $(u, v)$ ($u \\neq v$) and walk from $u$ using the shortest path to $v$ (note that $(u, v)$ is considered to be different from $(v, u)$).\n\nOddly, there are 2 special towns in Uberland named Flowrisa (denoted with the index $x$) and Beetopia (denoted with the index $y$). Flowrisa is a town where there are many strong-scent flowers, and Beetopia is another town where many bees live. In particular, Kuro will avoid any pair of towns $(u, v)$ if on the path from $u$ to $v$, he reaches Beetopia after he reached Flowrisa, since the bees will be attracted with the flower smell on Kuro\u2019s body and sting him.\n\nKuro wants to know how many pair of city $(u, v)$ he can take as his route. Since he\u2019s not really bright, he asked you to help him with this problem.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers $n$, $x$ and $y$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\leq x, y \\leq n$, $x \\ne y$) - the number of towns, index of the town Flowrisa and index of the town Beetopia, respectively.\n\n$n - 1$ lines follow, each line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$, $a \\ne b$), describes a road connecting two towns $a$ and $b$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that from each town, we can reach every other town in the city using the given roads.

Write a python script for the following problem: After the contest in comparing numbers, Shapur's teacher found out that he is a real genius and that no one could possibly do the calculations faster than him even using a super computer!\n\nSome days before the contest, the teacher took a very simple-looking exam and all his *n* students took part in the exam. The teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation.\n\nUnfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.\n\nNow the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers.\n\nShapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: \n -  As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. -  As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include \"-\", \";\" and \"_\". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. -  The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600 -  My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. -  Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN -  You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong. Do this by writing \"WA\" for Wrong answer or \"ACC\" for a correct answer. -  I should remind you that none of the strings (initial strings or answers) are empty. -  Finally, do these as soon as possible. You have less than 2 hours to complete this.\nInput specification: The first three lines contain a string each. These are the initial strings. They consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). All the initial strings have length from 1 to 100, inclusively.\n\nIn the fourth line there is a single integer *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000), the number of students.\n\nNext *n* lines contain a student's answer each. It is guaranteed that the answer meets what the teacher said. Each answer iconsists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\").

Once upon a time, the ruler of the ancient Egypt ordered the workers of Hanoi Factory to create as high tower as possible. They were not ready to serve such a strange order so they had to create this new tower using already produced rings.\n\nThere are *n* rings in factory's stock. The *i*-th ring has inner radius *a**i*, outer radius *b**i* and height *h**i*. The goal is to select some subset of rings and arrange them such that the following conditions are satisfied:\n -  Outer radiuses form a non-increasing sequence, i.e. one can put the *j*-th ring on the *i*-th ring only if *b**j*<=\u2264<=*b**i*. -  Rings should not fall one into the the other.

Write a python script for the following problem: Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.\n\nShop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following *n* days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in *i*-th day *k**i* products will be put up for sale and exactly *l**i* clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any *f* days from *n* next for sell-outs. On each of *f* chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on *i*-th day shop planned to put up for sale *k**i* products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7*k**i* products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.\n\nNoora's task is to choose *f* days to maximize total number of sold products.

In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2,\u20096,\u20092,\u20092] respectively.

That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\nThus, \"localization\" will be spelt as \"l10n\", and \"internationalization\u00bb will be spelt as \"i18n\".\n\nYou are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that all too long words should be replaced by the abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any changes.\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100).

Write a python script for the following problem: Kicker (table football) is a board game based on football, in which players control the footballers' figures mounted on rods by using bars to get the ball into the opponent's goal. When playing two on two, one player of each team controls the goalkeeper and the full-backs (plays defence), the other player controls the half-backs and forwards (plays attack).\n\nTwo teams of company Q decided to battle each other. Let's enumerate players from both teams by integers from 1 to 4. The first and second player play in the first team, the third and the fourth one play in the second team. For each of the four players we know their game skills in defence and attack. The defence skill of the *i*-th player is *a**i*, the attack skill is *b**i*.\n\nBefore the game, the teams determine how they will play. First the players of the first team decide who will play in the attack, and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do the same, based on the choice of their opponents.\n\nWe will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.\n\nThe teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally. Identify the team that is guaranteed to win (if both teams act optimally) or tell that there is no such team.\nInput specification: The input contain the players' description in four lines. The *i*-th line contains two space-separated integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the defence and the attack skill of the *i*-th player, correspondingly..

The first team can definitely win if it will choose the following arrangement: the first player plays attack, the second player plays defence.\n\nConsider the second sample. The order of the choosing roles for players makes sense in this sample. As the members of the first team choose first, the members of the second team can beat them (because they know the exact defence value and attack value of the first team)."}]}}

The *i*-th student will appear at the bus stop at time *t**i* (all *t**i*'s are distinct).\n\nWe shall assume that the stop is located on the coordinate axis *Ox*, at point *x*<==<=0, and the bus goes along the ray *Ox*, that is, towards the positive direction of the coordinate axis, and back. The *i*-th student needs to get to the point with coordinate *x**i* (*x**i*<=&gt;<=0).\n\nThe bus moves by the following algorithm. Initially it is at point 0. The students consistently come to the stop and get on it. The bus has a seating capacity which is equal to *m* passengers. At the moment when *m* students get on the bus, it starts moving in the positive direction of the coordinate axis. Also it starts moving when the last (*n*-th) student gets on the bus. The bus is moving at a speed of 1 unit of distance per 1 unit of time, i.e. it covers distance *y* in time *y*.\n\nEvery time the bus passes the point at which at least one student needs to get off, it stops and these students get off the bus. The students need 1<=+<=[*k*<=/<=2] units of time to get off the bus, where *k* is the number of students who leave at this point. Expression [*k*<=/<=2] denotes rounded down *k*<=/<=2. As soon as the last student leaves the bus, the bus turns around and goes back to the point *x*<==<=0. It doesn't make any stops until it reaches the point. At the given point the bus fills with students once more, and everything is repeated.\n\nIf students come to the stop when there's no bus, they form a line (queue) and get on the bus in the order in which they came. Any number of students get on the bus in negligible time, you should assume that it doesn't take any time. Any other actions also take no time. The bus has no other passengers apart from the students.\n\nWrite a program that will determine for each student the time when he got off the bus.

This student is the same as the student from the first sample. So the bus arrives to his destination at the moment of time 8, spends 1\u2009+\u2009[1\u2009/\u20092]\u2009=\u20091 units of time on getting him off, and returns back to 0 in additional 5 units of time. That is, the bus returns to the bus stop at the moment of time 14. By this moment the second student has already came to the bus stop.

However, Vasilisa the Wise does not know what the box's secret is, since she cannot open it again. She hopes that you will help her one more time with that.\n\nThe box's lock looks as follows: it contains 4 identical deepenings for gems as a 2<=\u00d7<=2 square, and some integer numbers are written at the lock's edge near the deepenings. The example of a lock is given on the picture below.\n\nThe box is accompanied with 9 gems. Their shapes match the deepenings' shapes and each gem contains one number from 1 to 9 (each number is written on exactly one gem). The box will only open after it is decorated with gems correctly: that is, each deepening in the lock should be filled with exactly one gem. Also, the sums of numbers in the square's rows, columns and two diagonals of the square should match the numbers written at the lock's edge. For example, the above lock will open if we fill the deepenings with gems with numbers as is shown on the picture below.\n\nNow Vasilisa the Wise wants to define, given the numbers on the box's lock, which gems she should put in the deepenings to open the box.

The only limitation that Vasya has \u2014 he does not want to do the same activity on two consecutive days: it means, he will not do sport on two consecutive days, and write the contest on two consecutive days.\nInput specification: The first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of days of Vasya's vacations.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence of integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=3) separated by space, where: \n -  *a**i* equals 0, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is closed and the contest is not carried out; -  *a**i* equals 1, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is closed, but the contest is carried out; -  *a**i* equals 2, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is open and the contest is not carried out; -  *a**i* equals 3, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is open and the contest is carried out.. Output specification: Print the minimum possible number of days on which Vasya will have a rest. Remember that Vasya refuses:\n -  to do sport on any two consecutive days, -  to write the contest on any two consecutive days.\nDemo input: ['4\\n1 3 2 0\\n', '7\\n1 3 3 2 1 2 3\\n', '2\\n2 2\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '0\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: In the first test Vasya can write the contest on the day number 1 and do sport on the day number 3. Thus, he will have a rest for only 2 days.\n\nIn the second test Vasya should write contests on days number 1, 3, 5 and 7, in other days do sport. Thus, he will not have a rest for a single day.\n\nIn the third test Vasya can do sport either on a day number 1 or number 2. He can not do sport in two days, because it will be contrary to the his limitation. Thus, he will have a rest for only one day."}]}}

The sensor is placed on the rim of the wheel, that is, on some fixed point on a circle of radius *r*. After that the counter moves just like the chosen point of the circle, i.e. moves forward and rotates around the center of the circle.\n\nAt the beginning each participant can choose any point *b**i*, such that his bike is fully behind the starting line, that is, *b**i*<=&lt;<=*s**i*<=-<=*r*. After that, he starts the movement, instantly accelerates to his maximum speed and at time *ts**i*, when the coordinate of the sensor is equal to the coordinate of the start, the time counter starts. The cyclist makes a complete ride, moving with his maximum speed and at the moment the sensor's coordinate is equal to the coordinate of the finish (moment of time *tf**i*), the time counter deactivates and records the final time. Thus, the counter records that the participant made a complete ride in time *tf**i*<=-<=*ts**i*.\n\nMaxim is good at math and he suspects that the total result doesn't only depend on his maximum speed *v*, but also on his choice of the initial point *b**i*. Now Maxim is asking you to calculate for each of *n* competitions the minimum possible time that can be measured by the time counter.

The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.. Output specification: Print the name of the winner (\"Kuro\", \"Shiro\" or \"Katie\"). If there are at least two cats that share the maximum beauty, print \"Draw\".\nDemo input: ['3\\nKuroo\\nShiro\\nKatie\\n', '7\\ntreasurehunt\\nthreefriends\\nhiCodeforces\\n', '1\\nabcabc\\ncbabac\\nababca\\n', '15\\nfoPaErcvJ\\nmZaxowpbt\\nmkuOlaHRE\\n'], Demo output: ['Kuro\\n', 'Shiro\\n', 'Katie\\n', 'Draw\\n']\nNote: In the first example, after $3$ turns, Kuro can change his ribbon into ooooo, which has the beauty of $5$, while reaching such beauty for Shiro and Katie is impossible (both Shiro and Katie can reach the beauty of at most $4$, for example by changing Shiro's ribbon into SSiSS and changing Katie's ribbon into Kaaaa). Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice. Therefore, the game ends in a draw."}]}}

Progressions in Uzhlyandia are unusual: both *b*1 and *q* can equal 0. Also, Dvastan gave Masha *m* \"bad\" integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**m*, and an integer *l*.\n\nMasha writes all progression terms one by one onto the board (including repetitive) while condition |*b**i*|<=\u2264<=*l* is satisfied (|*x*| means absolute value of *x*). There is an exception: if a term equals one of the \"bad\" integers, Masha skips it (doesn't write onto the board) and moves forward to the next term.\n\nBut the lesson is going to end soon, so Masha has to calculate how many integers will be written on the board. In order not to get into depression, Masha asked you for help: help her calculate how many numbers she will write, or print \"inf\" in case she needs to write infinitely many integers.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains four integers *b*1, *q*, *l*, *m* (-109<=\u2264<=*b*1,<=*q*<=\u2264<=109, 1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=109, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the initial term and the common ratio of progression, absolute value of maximal number that can be written on the board and the number of \"bad\" integers, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains *m* distinct integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**m* (-109<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 numbers that will never be written on the board..

This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.\n\nShop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following *n* days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in *i*-th day *k**i* products will be put up for sale and exactly *l**i* clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any *f* days from *n* next for sell-outs. On each of *f* chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on *i*-th day shop planned to put up for sale *k**i* products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7*k**i* products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.\n\nNoora's task is to choose *f* days to maximize total number of sold products.

In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2,\u20096,\u20092,\u20092] respectively.

Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell..

Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of dogs.\nDemo input: ['6 6\\n..S...\\n..S.W.\\n.S....\\n..W...\\n...W..\\n......\\n', '1 2\\nSW\\n', '5 5\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS....\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n..SD..\\n..SDW.\\n.SD...\\n.DW...\\nDD.W..\\n......\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS.D..\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n']\nNote: In the first example, we can split the pasture into two halves, one containing wolves and one containing sheep. Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy.

Write a python script for the following problem: The heat during the last few days has been really intense. Scientists from all over the Berland study how the temperatures and weather change, and they claim that this summer is abnormally hot. But any scientific claim sounds a lot more reasonable if there are some numbers involved, so they have decided to actually calculate some value which would represent how high the temperatures are.\n\nMathematicians of Berland State University came up with a special heat intensity value. This value is calculated as follows:\n\nSuppose we want to analyze the segment of $n$ consecutive days. We have measured the temperatures during these $n$ days; the temperature during $i$-th day equals $a_i$.\n\nWe denote the average temperature of a segment of some consecutive days as the arithmetic mean of the temperature measures during this segment of days. So, if we want to analyze the average temperature from day $x$ to day $y$, we calculate it as $\\frac{\\sum \\limits_{i = x}^{y} a_i}{y - x + 1}$ (note that division is performed without any rounding). The heat intensity value is the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than $k$ consecutive days. For example, if analyzing the measures $[3, 4, 1, 2]$ and $k = 3$, we are interested in segments $[3, 4, 1]$, $[4, 1, 2]$ and $[3, 4, 1, 2]$ (we want to find the maximum value of average temperature over these segments).\n\nYou have been hired by Berland State University to write a program that would compute the heat intensity value of a given period of days. Are you up to this task?\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n \\le 5000$) \u2014 the number of days in the given period, and the minimum number of days in a segment we consider when calculating heat intensity value, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 5000$) \u2014 the temperature measures during given $n$ days.. Output specification: Print one real number \u2014 the heat intensity value, i. e., the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than $k$ consecutive days.\n\nYour answer will be considered correct if the following condition holds: $|res - res_0| &lt; 10^{-6}$, where $res$ is your answer, and $res_0$ is the answer given by the jury's solution.\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n3 4 1 2\\n'], Demo output: ['2.666666666666667\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

As the lecture was boring, Vasya decided to complete the picture by composing a graph *G* with the following properties: \n -  *G* has exactly *n* vertices, numbered from 1 to *n*. -  For all pairs of vertices *i* and *j*, where *i*<=\u2260<=*j*, there is an edge connecting them if and only if characters *s**i* and *s**j* are either equal or neighbouring in the alphabet. That is, letters in pairs \"a\"-\"b\" and \"b\"-\"c\" are neighbouring, while letters \"a\"-\"c\" are not. \nVasya painted the resulting graph near the string and then erased the string. Next day Vasya's friend Petya came to a lecture and found some graph at his desk. He had heard of Vasya's adventure and now he wants to find out whether it could be the original graph *G*, painted by Vasya. In order to verify this, Petya needs to know whether there exists a string *s*, such that if Vasya used this *s* he would produce the given graph *G*.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* \u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices and edges in the graph found by Petya, respectively.\n\nEach of the next *m* lines contains two integers *u**i* and *v**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*u**i*<=\u2260<=*v**i*)\u00a0\u2014 the edges of the graph *G*.

So, these vertices can correspond to both the same and adjacent letters. Any of the following strings \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"bb\", \"bc\", \"cb\", \"cc\" meets the graph's conditions. \n\nIn the second sample the first vertex is connected to all three other vertices, but these three vertices are not connected with each other. That means that they must correspond to distinct letters that are not adjacent, but that is impossible as there are only two such letters: a and c."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.\n\nShop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following *n* days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in *i*-th day *k**i* products will be put up for sale and exactly *l**i* clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any *f* days from *n* next for sell-outs. On each of *f* chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on *i*-th day shop planned to put up for sale *k**i* products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7*k**i* products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.\n\nNoora's task is to choose *f* days to maximize total number of sold products.

In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2,\u20096,\u20092,\u20092] respectively.

Write a python script for the following problem: Developers often face with regular expression patterns. A pattern is usually defined as a string consisting of characters and metacharacters that sets the rules for your search. These patterns are most often used to check whether a particular string meets the certain rules.\n\nIn this task, a pattern will be a string consisting of small English letters and question marks ('?'). The question mark in the pattern is a metacharacter that denotes an arbitrary small letter of the English alphabet. We will assume that a string matches the pattern if we can transform the string into the pattern by replacing the question marks by the appropriate characters. For example, string aba matches patterns: ???, ??a, a?a, aba.\n\nProgrammers that work for the R1 company love puzzling each other (and themselves) with riddles. One of them is as follows: you are given *n* patterns of the same length, you need to find a pattern that contains as few question marks as possible, and intersects with each of the given patterns. Two patterns intersect if there is a string that matches both the first and the second pattern. Can you solve this riddle?\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of patterns. Next *n* lines contain the patterns.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the patterns can only consist of small English letters and symbols '?'. All patterns are non-empty and have the same length.

Pattern xab intersects with each of the given patterns. Pattern ??? also intersects with each of the given patterns, but it contains more question signs, hence it is not an optimal answer. Clearly, xab is the optimal answer, because it doesn't contain any question sign. There are a lot of other optimal answers, for example: aab, bab, cab, dab and so on."}]}}

For each it's undirected edge (*a**i*, *b**i*) you are given the flow volume *c**i*. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:\n 1.  for each vertex *v* (1<=&lt;<=*v*<=&lt;<=*n*), sum of *c**i* of incoming edges is equal to the sum of *c**i* of outcoming edges; 1.  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges; 1.  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105, *n*<=-<=1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph.

Write a python script for the following problem: Limak is a little polar bear. Polar bears hate long strings and thus they like to compress them. You should also know that Limak is so young that he knows only first six letters of the English alphabet: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' and 'f'.\n\nYou are given a set of *q* possible operations. Limak can perform them in any order, any operation may be applied any number of times. The *i*-th operation is described by a string *a**i* of length two and a string *b**i* of length one. No two of *q* possible operations have the same string *a**i*.\n\nWhen Limak has a string *s* he can perform the *i*-th operation on *s* if the first two letters of *s* match a two-letter string *a**i*. Performing the *i*-th operation removes first two letters of *s* and inserts there a string *b**i*. See the notes section for further clarification.\n\nYou may note that performing an operation decreases the length of a string *s* exactly by 1. Also, for some sets of operations there may be a string that cannot be compressed any further, because the first two letters don't match any *a**i*.\n\nLimak wants to start with a string of length *n* and perform *n*<=-<=1 operations to finally get a one-letter string \"a\". In how many ways can he choose the starting string to be able to get \"a\"? Remember that Limak can use only letters he knows.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *q* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=6, 1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=36)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the initial string and the number of available operations.\n\nThe next *q* lines describe the possible operations.

That is, the bus returns to the bus stop at the moment of time 14. By this moment the second student has already came to the bus stop. So he immediately gets in the bus, and is driven to his destination in additional 5 units of time. He gets there at the moment 14\u2009+\u20095\u2009=\u200919. \n\nIn the third sample the bus waits for the fourth student for 6 units of time, then drives for 5 units of time, then gets the passengers off for 1\u2009+\u2009[4\u2009/\u20092]\u2009=\u20093 units of time, then returns for 5 units of time, and then drives the fifth student for 1 unit of time."}]}}

For this problem he gets 250\u2009-\u20092\u00b750\u2009=\u2009150 points. \nSo, Limak got 30\u2009+\u200935\u2009+\u2009150\u2009=\u2009215 points.\n\nRadewoosh solves problem in the reversed order:\n 1.

More formally, if you are standing on the tile number *i* (*i*<=&lt;<=*n*<=-<=1), you can reach the tiles number *i*<=+<=1 or the tile number *i*<=+<=2 from it (if you stand on the tile number *n*<=-<=1, you can only reach tile number *n*). We can assume that all the opposition movements occur instantaneously.\n\nIn order to thwart an opposition rally, the Berland bloody regime organized the rain. The tiles on the boulevard are of poor quality and they are rapidly destroyed in the rain. We know that the *i*-th tile is destroyed after *a**i* days of rain (on day *a**i* tile isn't destroyed yet, and on day *a**i*<=+<=1 it is already destroyed). Of course, no one is allowed to walk on the destroyed tiles! So the walk of the opposition is considered thwarted, if either the tile number 1 is broken, or the tile number *n* is broken, or it is impossible to reach the tile number *n* from the tile number 1 if we can walk on undestroyed tiles.\n\nThe opposition wants to gather more supporters for their walk. Therefore, the more time they have to pack, the better. Help the opposition to calculate how much time they still have and tell us for how many days the walk from the tile number 1 to the tile number *n* will be possible.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=103) \u2014 the boulevard's length in tiles.\n\nThe second line contains *n* space-separated integers *a**i* \u2014 the number of days after which the *i*-th tile gets destroyed (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=103).. Output specification: Print a single number \u2014 the sought number of days.\nDemo input: ['4\\n10 3 5 10\\n', '5\\n10 2 8 3 5\\n'], Demo output: ['5\\n', '5\\n']\nNote: In the first sample the second tile gets destroyed after day three, and the only path left is 1\u2009\u2192\u20093\u2009\u2192\u20094. After day five there is a two-tile gap between the first and the last tile, you can't jump over it.\n\nIn the second sample path 1\u2009\u2192\u20093\u2009\u2192\u20095 is available up to day five, inclusive. On day six the last tile is destroyed and the walk is thwarted."}]}}

Of course, a member can't be a friend with themselves.\n\nLet A-B denote that members A and B are friends. Limak thinks that a network is reasonable if and only if the following condition is satisfied: For every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z then also X-Z.\n\nFor example: if Alan and Bob are friends, and Bob and Ciri are friends, then Alan and Ciri should be friends as well.\n\nCan you help Limak and check if the network is reasonable?

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.

If you teach him a subject, then time required to teach any chapter of the next subject will require exactly 1 hour less than previously required (see the examples to understand it more clearly). Note that his per chapter learning power can not be less than 1 hour.\n\nYou can teach him the *n* subjects in any possible order. Find out minimum amount of time (in hours) Devu will take to understand all the subjects and you will be free to do some enjoying task rather than teaching a dumb guy.\n\nPlease be careful that answer might not fit in 32 bit data type.\nInput specification: The first line will contain two space separated integers *n*, *x* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*x*<=\u2264<=105).

Consider the order of subjects: 1, 2. When you teach Devu the first subject, it will take him 3 hours per chapter, so it will take 12 hours to teach first subject. After teaching first subject, his per chapter learning time will be 2 hours. Now teaching him second subject will take 2\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009=\u20092 hours. Hence you will need to spend 12\u2009+\u20092\u2009=\u200914 hours.\n\nConsider the order of subjects: 2, 1. When you teach Devu the second subject, then it will take him 3 hours per chapter, so it will take 3\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009=\u20093 hours to teach the second subject. After teaching the second subject, his per chapter learning time will be 2 hours. Now teaching him the first subject will take 2\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009=\u20098 hours. Hence you will need to spend 11 hours.\n\nSo overall, minimum of both the cases is 11 hours.\n\nLook at the third example. The order in this example doesn't matter. When you teach Devu the first subject, it will take him 3 hours per chapter. When you teach Devu the second subject, it will take him 2 hours per chapter. When you teach Devu the third subject, it will take him 1 hours per chapter. In total it takes 6 hours."}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.

The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs. Separate the numbers by spaces.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++.

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here.

Also, let's mark the robot's current position as (*x*,<=*y*). In order to destroy all the bombs, the robot can perform three types of operations:\n 1.  Operation has format \"1 k dir\". To perform the operation robot have to move in direction *dir* *k* (*k*<=\u2265<=1) times. There are only 4 directions the robot can move in: \"R\", \"L\", \"U\", \"D\".

It is forbidden to move from point (*x*,<=*y*), if at least one point on the path (besides the destination point) contains a bomb. 1.  Operation has format \"2\". To perform the operation robot have to pick a bomb at point (*x*,<=*y*) and put it in a special container. Thus, the robot can carry the bomb from any point to any other point. The operation cannot be performed if point (*x*,<=*y*) has no bomb. It is forbidden to pick a bomb if the robot already has a bomb in its container. 1.  Operation has format \"3\".

Some cells were wasteland, and other each cell contained crop plants: either carrots or kiwis or grapes. \n\nAfter seeing the field carefully, Ciel found that the crop plants of each cell were planted in following procedure:\n -  Assume that the rows are numbered 1 to *n* from top to bottom and the columns are numbered 1 to *m* from left to right, and a cell in row *i* and column *j* is represented as (*i*,<=*j*). -  First, each field is either cultivated or waste. Crop plants will be planted in the cultivated cells in the order of (1,<=1)<=\u2192<=...<=\u2192<=(1,<=*m*)<=\u2192<=(2,<=1)<=\u2192<=...<=\u2192<=(2,<=*m*)<=\u2192<=...<=\u2192<=(*n*,<=1)<=\u2192<=...<=\u2192<=(*n*,<=*m*). Waste cells will be ignored. -  Crop plants (either carrots or kiwis or grapes) will be planted in each cell one after another cyclically. Carrots will be planted in the first cell, then kiwis in the second one, grapes in the third one, carrots in the forth one, kiwis in the fifth one, and so on. \nThe following figure will show you the example of this procedure. Here, a white square represents a cultivated cell, and a black square represents a waste cell.\n\nNow she is wondering how to determine the crop plants in some certain cells.\nInput specification: In the first line there are four positive integers *n*,<=*m*,<=*k*,<=*t* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=4\u00b7104,<=1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=4\u00b7104,<=1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=103,<=1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=103), each of which represents the height of the field, the width of the field, the number of waste cells and the number of queries that ask the kind of crop plants in a certain cell.\n\nFollowing each *k* lines contains two integers *a*,<=*b* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=*m*), which denotes a cell (*a*,<=*b*) is waste. It is guaranteed that the same cell will not appear twice in this section.\n\nFollowing each *t* lines contains two integers *i*,<=*j* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*j*<=\u2264<=*m*), which is a query that asks you the kind of crop plants of a cell (*i*,<=*j*).. Output specification: For each query, if the cell is waste, print Waste. Otherwise, print the name of crop plants in the cell: either Carrots or Kiwis or Grapes.\nDemo input: ['4 5 5 6\\n4 3\\n1 3\\n3 3\\n2 5\\n3 2\\n1 3\\n1 4\\n2 3\\n2 4\\n1 1\\n1 1\\n'], Demo output: ['Waste\\nGrapes\\nCarrots\\nKiwis\\nCarrots\\nCarrots\\n']\nNote: The sample corresponds to the figure in the statement."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Heidi's friend Jenny is asking Heidi to deliver an important letter to one of their common friends. Since Jenny is Irish, Heidi thinks that this might be a prank. More precisely, she suspects that the message she is asked to deliver states: \"Send the fool further!\", and upon reading it the recipient will ask Heidi to deliver the same message to yet another friend (that the recipient has in common with Heidi), and so on.\n\nHeidi believes that her friends want to avoid awkward situations, so she will not be made to visit the same person (including Jenny) twice. She also knows how much it costs to travel between any two of her friends who know each other.

For example, string \"aba\" has six substrings: \"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aba\".\n\nDr. Moriarty plans to take string *s* and cut out some substring from it, let's call it *t*. Then he needs to change the substring *t* zero or more times. As a result, he should obtain a fixed string *u* (which is the string that should be sent to Sherlock Holmes). One change is defined as making one of the following actions: \n -  Insert one letter to any end of the string. -  Delete one letter from any end of the string. -  Change one letter into any other one. \nMoriarty is very smart and after he chooses some substring *t*, he always makes the minimal number of changes to obtain *u*. \n\nHelp Moriarty choose the best substring *t* from all substrings of the string *s*. The substring *t* should minimize the number of changes Moriarty should make to obtain the string *u* from it.\nInput specification: The first line contains a non-empty string *s*, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

Then you will only have to make one change: to change or to add the last character.\n\nIn the third sample the initial string *s* doesn't contain any character that the message should contain, so, whatever string you choose, you will have to make at least 7 changes to obtain the required message."}]}}

The Beaver's teeth are strong enough, so the authorities assured that upon arriving at the place the beaver won't have any problems with opening the safe.\n\nAnd he finishes his aspen sprig and leaves for this important task. Of course, the Beaver arrived at the location without any problems, but alas. He can't open the safe with his strong and big teeth. At this point, the Smart Beaver get a call from the headquarters and learns that opening the safe with the teeth is not necessary, as a reliable source has sent the following information: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. There also is a special hint, which can be used to open the safe. The hint is string *s* with the following structure:\n -  if *s**i* = \"?\", then the digit that goes *i*-th in the safe code can be anything (between 0 to 9, inclusively); -  if *s**i* is a digit (between 0 to 9, inclusively), then it means that there is digit *s**i* on position *i* in code; -  if the string contains letters from \"A\" to \"J\", then all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits and the positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits. -  The length of the safe code coincides with the length of the hint. \nFor example, hint \"?JGJ9\" has such matching safe code variants: \"51919\", \"55959\", \"12329\", \"93539\" and so on, and has wrong variants such as: \"56669\", \"00111\", \"03539\" and \"13666\".\n\nAfter receiving such information, the authorities change the plan and ask the special agents to work quietly and gently and not to try to open the safe by mechanical means, and try to find the password using the given hint.\n\nAt a special agent school the Smart Beaver was the fastest in his platoon finding codes for such safes, but now he is not in that shape: the years take their toll ...

The Beaver's teeth are strong enough, so the authorities assured that upon arriving at the place the beaver won't have any problems with opening the safe.\n\nAnd he finishes his aspen sprig and leaves for this important task. Of course, the Beaver arrived at the location without any problems, but alas. He can't open the safe with his strong and big teeth. At this point, the Smart Beaver get a call from the headquarters and learns that opening the safe with the teeth is not necessary, as a reliable source has sent the following information: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. There also is a special hint, which can be used to open the safe. The hint is string *s* with the following structure:\n -  if *s**i* = \"?\", then the digit that goes *i*-th in the safe code can be anything (between 0 to 9, inclusively); -  if *s**i* is a digit (between 0 to 9, inclusively), then it means that there is digit *s**i* on position *i* in code; -  if the string contains letters from \"A\" to \"J\", then all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits and the positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits. -  The length of the safe code coincides with the length of the hint. \nFor example, hint \"?JGJ9\" has such matching safe code variants: \"51919\", \"55959\", \"12329\", \"93539\" and so on, and has wrong variants such as: \"56669\", \"00111\", \"03539\" and \"13666\".\n\nAfter receiving such information, the authorities change the plan and ask the special agents to work quietly and gently and not to try to open the safe by mechanical means, and try to find the password using the given hint.\n\nAt a special agent school the Smart Beaver was the fastest in his platoon finding codes for such safes, but now he is not in that shape: the years take their toll ...

The first and last holds must stay at their positions.\n\nHelp Mike determine the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of holds.\n\nThe next line contains *n* space-separated integers *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=1000), where *a**i* is the height where the hold number *i* hangs. The sequence *a**i* is increasing (i.e. each element except for the first one is strictly larger than the previous one).. Output specification: Print a single number \u2014 the minimum difficulty of the track after removing a single hold.\nDemo input: ['3\\n1 4 6\\n', '5\\n1 2 3 4 5\\n', '5\\n1 2 3 7 8\\n'], Demo output: ['5\\n', '2\\n', '4\\n']\nNote: In the first sample you can remove only the second hold, then the sequence looks like (1,\u20096), the maximum difference of the neighboring elements equals 5.\n\nIn the second test after removing every hold the difficulty equals 2.\n\nIn the third test you can obtain sequences (1,\u20093,\u20097,\u20098), (1,\u20092,\u20097,\u20098), (1,\u20092,\u20093,\u20098), for which the difficulty is 4, 5 and 5, respectively. Thus, after removing the second element we obtain the optimal answer \u2014 4."}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, on a programming lesson little Petya showed how quickly he can create files and folders on the computer. But he got soon fed up with this activity, and he decided to do a much more useful thing. He decided to calculate what folder contains most subfolders (including nested folders, nested folders of nested folders, and so on) and what folder contains most files (including the files in the subfolders).\n\nMore formally, the subfolders of the folder are all its directly nested folders and the subfolders of these nested folders. The given folder is not considered the subfolder of itself. A file is regarded as lying in a folder, if and only if it either lies directly in this folder, or lies in some subfolder of the folder.\n\nFor a better understanding of how to count subfolders and files for calculating the answer, see notes and answers to the samples.\n\nYou are given a few files that Petya has managed to create. The path to each file looks as follows:\n\n*diskName*:\\*folder*1\\*folder*2\\...\\ *folder**n*\\*fileName* \n-  *diskName* is single capital letter from the set {C,D,E,F,G}.-  *folder*1, ..., *folder**n* are folder names. Each folder name is nonempty sequence of lowercase Latin letters and digits from 0 to 9. (*n*<=\u2265<=1)-  *fileName* is a file name in the form of *name*.*extension*, where the *name* and the *extension* are nonempty sequences of lowercase Latin letters and digits from 0 to 9. \nIt is also known that there is no file whose path looks like *diskName*:\\*fileName*. That is, each file is stored in some folder, but there are no files directly in the root. Also let us assume that the disk root is not a folder.\n\nHelp Petya to find the largest number of subfolders, which can be in some folder, and the largest number of files that can be in some folder, counting all its subfolders.\nInput specification: Each line of input data contains the description of one file path. The length of each line does not exceed 100, and overall there are no more than 100 lines. It is guaranteed, that all the paths are correct and meet the above rules. It is also guaranteed, that there are no two completely equal lines. That is, each file is described exactly once.\n\nThere is at least one line in the input data.. Output specification: Print two space-separated numbers. The first one is the maximal number of possible subfolders in a folder (including nested folders, nested folders of nested folders, and so on). The second one is the maximal number of files in a folder (including nested files in subfolders). Note that the disks are not regarded as folders.\nDemo input: ['C:\\\\folder1\\\\file1.txt', 'C:\\\\folder1\\\\folder2\\\\folder3\\\\file1.txt\\nC:\\\\folder1\\\\folder2\\\\folder4\\\\file1.txt\\nD:\\\\folder1\\\\file1.txt\\n', 'C:\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file.txt\\nC:\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file2\\\\file.txt'], Demo output: ['0 1', '3 2', '4 2']\nNote: In the first sample we have one folder on the \"C\" disk. It has no subfolders, which is why the first number in the answer is 0. But this folder contains one file, so the second number of the answer is 1.\n\nIn the second sample we have several different folders. Consider the \"folder1\" folder on the \"C\" disk. This folder directly contains one folder, \"folder2\". The \"folder2\" folder contains two more folders \u2014 \"folder3\" and \"folder4\". Thus, the \"folder1\" folder on the \"C\" drive has exactly 3 subfolders. Also this folder contains two files, even though they do not lie directly in the folder, but they are located in subfolders of \"folder1\".\n\nIn the third example we see that the names of some folders and some subfolders are identical. Consider the \"file\" folder, which lies directly on the \"C\" disk. That folder contains another \"file\" folder, which in turn contains another \"file\" folder, which contains two more folders, \"file\" and \"file2\". Thus, the \"file\" folder, which lies directly on the \"C\" disk, contains 4 subfolders."}]}}

We know only one thing for sure: the centers of the pair of rings are not the same.\n\nWhen Sasha got tired and fell into a deep sleep, a girl called Ilona came into the room and wanted to cut a circle for the sake of good memories. To make the circle beautiful, she decided to cut along the contour.\n\nWe'll consider a contour to be a continuous closed line through which there is transition from one color to another (see notes for clarification). If the contour takes the form of a circle, then the result will be cutting out a circle, which Iona wants.\n\nBut the girl's inquisitive mathematical mind does not rest: how many ways are there to cut a circle out of the canvas?\nInput specification: The input contains two lines. \n\nEach line has four space-separated integers *x**i*, *y**i*, *r**i*, *R**i*, that describe the *i*-th ring; *x**i* and *y**i* are coordinates of the ring's center, *r**i* and *R**i* are the internal and external radii of the ring correspondingly (<=-<=100<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=100;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=&lt;<=*R**i*<=\u2264<=100). \n\nIt is guaranteed that the centers of the rings do not coinside..

Write a python script for the following problem: Vasya has been playing Plane of Tanks with his friends the whole year. Now it is time to divide the participants into several categories depending on their results. \n\nA player is given a non-negative integer number of points in each round of the Plane of Tanks. Vasya wrote results for each round of the last year. He has *n* records in total.\n\nIn order to determine a player's category consider the best result obtained by the player and the best results of other players. The player belongs to category: \n -  \"noob\" \u2014 if more than 50% of players have better results; -  \"random\" \u2014 if his result is not worse than the result that 50% of players have, but more than 20% of players have better results; -  \"average\" \u2014 if his result is not worse than the result that 80% of players have, but more than 10% of players have better results; -  \"hardcore\" \u2014 if his result is not worse than the result that 90% of players have, but more than 1% of players have better results; -  \"pro\" \u2014 if his result is not worse than the result that 99% of players have. \nWhen the percentage is calculated the player himself is taken into account.

The children in the queue after the *v**i*-th child almost do not hear the crying, so their confidence remains unchanged.\n\nIf at any point in time the confidence of the *j*-th child is less than zero, he begins to cry with the volume of *d**j* and leaves the line, running towards the exit, without going to the doctor's office.

It's known that position of all Ciel's cards is Attack.\n\nNow is Ciel's battle phase, Ciel can do the following operation many times:\n 1.  Choose one of her cards *X*. This card mustn't be chosen before. 1.  If Jiro has no alive cards at that moment, he gets the damage equal to (*X*'s strength). Otherwise, Ciel needs to choose one Jiro's alive card *Y*, then:   If *Y*'s position is Attack, then (*X*'s strength) <=\u2265<= (*Y*'s strength) must hold. After this attack, card *Y* dies, and Jiro gets the damage equal to (*X*'s strength) - (*Y*'s strength). 1.  If *Y*'s position is Defense, then (*X*'s strength) <=&gt;<= (*Y*'s strength) must hold. After this attack, card *Y* dies, but Jiro gets no damage.  \nCiel can end her battle phase at any moment (so, she can use not all her cards). Help the Fox to calculate the maximal sum of damage Jiro can get.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of cards Jiro and Ciel have.\n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains a string *position* and an integer *strength* (0<=\u2264<=*strength*<=\u2264<=8000) \u2014 the position and strength of Jiro's current card. Position is the string \"ATK\" for attack, and the string \"DEF\" for defense.\n\nEach of the next *m* lines contains an integer *strength* (0<=\u2264<=*strength*<=\u2264<=8000) \u2014 the strength of Ciel's current card.. Output specification: Output an integer: the maximal damage Jiro can get.\nDemo input: ['2 3\\nATK 2000\\nDEF 1700\\n2500\\n2500\\n2500\\n', '3 4\\nATK 10\\nATK 100\\nATK 1000\\n1\\n11\\n101\\n1001\\n', '2 4\\nDEF 0\\nATK 0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n'], Demo output: ['3000\\n', '992\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: In the first test case, Ciel has 3 cards with same *strength*. The best strategy is as follows. First she uses one of these 3 cards to attack \"ATK 2000\" card first, this attack destroys that card and Jiro gets 2500\u2009-\u20092000\u2009=\u2009500 damage. Then she uses the second card to destroy the \"DEF 1700\" card. Jiro doesn't get damage that time. Now Jiro has no cards so she can use the third card to attack and Jiro gets 2500 damage. So the answer is 500\u2009+\u20092500\u2009=\u20093000.\n\nIn the second test case, she should use the \"1001\" card to attack the \"ATK 100\" card, then use the \"101\" card to attack the \"ATK 10\" card. Now Ciel still has cards but she can choose to end her battle phase. The total damage equals (1001\u2009-\u2009100)\u2009+\u2009(101\u2009-\u200910)\u2009=\u2009992.\n\nIn the third test case note that she can destroy the \"ATK 0\" card by a card with strength equal to 0, but she can't destroy a \"DEF 0\" card with that card."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: \n -  alloc n \u2014 to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; \nThe memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.\n\nThe first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.\nInput specification: The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100;1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *t* \u2014 the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* \u2014 the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.. Output specification: Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession. Output lines should go in the same order in which the operations are processed. Successful procession of alloc operation should return integers, starting with 1, as the identifiers of the allocated blocks.\nDemo input: ['6 10\\nalloc 5\\nalloc 3\\nerase 1\\nalloc 6\\ndefragment\\nalloc 6\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n2\\nNULL\\n3\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Output specification: Print the number of pairs (*i*, *j*) so that *i*<=&lt;<=*j* and the pair of integers *a**i* and *a**j* is k-interesting.\nDemo input: ['4 1\\n0 3 2 1\\n', '6 0\\n200 100 100 100 200 200\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n', '6\\n']\nNote: In the first test there are 4 k-interesting pairs:\n -  (1, 3), -  (1, 4), -  (2, 3), -  (2, 4). \nIn the second test *k*\u2009=\u20090. Consequently, integers in any k-interesting pair should be equal to themselves. Thus, for the second test there are 6 k-interesting pairs:\n -  (1, 5), -  (1, 6), -  (2, 3), -  (2, 4), -  (3, 4), -  (5, 6)."}]}}

We will assume that the bar is a segment on the *Ox* axis between points 0 and |*s*|<=-<=1.\n\nThe decoding of the lever description is given below.\n -  If the *i*-th character of the string equals \"^\", that means that at coordinate *i* there is the pivot under the bar. -  If the *i*-th character of the string equals \"=\", that means that at coordinate *i* there is nothing lying on the bar. -  If the *i*-th character of the string equals digit *c* (1-9), that means that at coordinate *i* there is a weight of mass *c* on the bar. \nYour task is, given the lever description, print if it will be in balance or not. Assume that the bar doesn't weight anything. Assume that the bar initially is in balance then all weights are simultaneously put on it. After that the bar either tilts to the left, or tilts to the right, or is in balance.\nInput specification: The first line contains the lever description as a non-empty string *s* (3<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=106), consisting of digits (1-9) and characters \"^\" and \"=\". It is guaranteed that the line contains exactly one character \"^\". It is guaranteed that the pivot of the lever isn't located in any end of the lever bar.\n\nTo solve the problem you may need 64-bit integer numbers. Please, do not forget to use them in your programs.. Output specification: Print \"left\" if the given lever tilts to the left, \"right\" if it tilts to the right and \"balance\", if it is in balance.\nDemo input: ['=^==\\n', '9===^==1\\n', '2==^7==\\n', '41^52==\\n'], Demo output: ['balance\\n', 'left\\n', 'right\\n', 'balance\\n']\nNote: As you solve the problem, you may find the following link useful to better understand how a lever functions: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever.\n\nThe pictures to the examples:"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: A median in an array with the length of *n* is an element which occupies position number  after we sort the elements in the non-decreasing order (the array elements are numbered starting with 1). A median of an array (2,<=6,<=1,<=2,<=3) is the number 2, and a median of array (0,<=96,<=17,<=23) \u2014 the number 17.\n\nWe define an expression  as the integer part of dividing number *a* by number *b*.\n\nOne day Vasya showed Petya an array consisting of *n* integers and suggested finding the array's median. Petya didn't even look at the array and said that it equals *x*. Petya is a very honest boy, so he decided to add several numbers to the given array so that the median of the resulting array would be equal to *x*.\n\nPetya can add any integers from 1 to 105 to the array, including the same numbers. Of course, he can add nothing to the array. If a number is added multiple times, then we should consider it the number of times it occurs.

A bridge bidirectionally connects two different islands and has length 1.

In total, there are *n* tasks for the day and each animal should do each of these tasks. For each task, they have evaluated its difficulty. Also animals decided to do the tasks in order of their difficulty. Unfortunately, some tasks can have the same difficulty, so the order in which one can perform the tasks may vary.\n\nMenshykov, Uslada and Horace ask you to deal with this nuisance and come up with individual plans for each of them. The plan is a sequence describing the order in which an animal should do all the *n* tasks. Besides, each of them wants to have its own unique plan. Therefore three plans must form three different sequences. You are to find the required plans, or otherwise deliver the sad news to them by stating that it is impossible to come up with three distinct plans for the given tasks.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2000) \u2014 the number of tasks.

Write a python script for the following problem: After a wonderful evening in the restaurant the time to go home came. Leha as a true gentlemen suggested Noora to give her a lift. Certainly the girl agreed with pleasure. Suddenly one problem appeared: Leha cannot find his car on a huge parking near the restaurant. So he decided to turn to the watchman for help.\n\nFormally the parking can be represented as a matrix 109<=\u00d7<=109. There is exactly one car in every cell of the matrix. All cars have their own machine numbers represented as a positive integer. Let's index the columns of the matrix by integers from 1 to 109 from left to right and the rows by integers from 1 to 109 from top to bottom. By coincidence it turned out, that for every cell (*x*,<=*y*) the number of the car, which stands in this cell, is equal to the minimum positive integer, which can't be found in the cells (*i*,<=*y*) and (*x*,<=*j*), 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*x*,<=1<=\u2264<=*j*<=&lt;<=*y*.\n\nLeha wants to ask the watchman *q* requests, which can help him to find his car. Every request is represented as five integers *x*1,<=*y*1,<=*x*2,<=*y*2,<=*k*. The watchman have to consider all cells (*x*,<=*y*) of the matrix, such that *x*1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*x*2 and *y*1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*y*2, and if the number of the car in cell (*x*,<=*y*) does not exceed *k*, increase the answer to the request by the number of the car in cell (*x*,<=*y*). For each request Leha asks the watchman to tell him the resulting sum. Due to the fact that the sum can turn out to be quite large, hacker asks to calculate it modulo 109<=+<=7.\n\nHowever the requests seem to be impracticable for the watchman. Help the watchman to answer all Leha's requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains one integer *q* (1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=104)\u00a0\u2014 the number of Leha's requests.\n\nThe next *q* lines contain five integers *x*1,<=*y*1,<=*x*2,<=*y*2,<=*k* (1<=\u2264<=*x*1<=\u2264<=*x*2<=\u2264<=109,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*1<=\u2264<=*y*2<=\u2264<=109,<=1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7109)\u00a0\u2014 parameters of Leha's requests..

In each case the requested submatrix is highlighted in blue.\n\nIn the first request (*k*\u2009=\u20091) Leha asks only about the upper left parking cell. In this cell the car's number is 1. Consequentally the answer is 1.\n\n<img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/76839e22308c8bf65bf6a862f4c9bc49b50ec2f4.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\nIn the second request (*k*\u2009=\u20095) suitable numbers are 4,\u20091,\u20092,\u20093,\u20092,\u20091. Consequentally the answer is 4\u2009+\u20091\u2009+\u20092\u2009+\u20093\u2009+\u20092\u2009+\u20091\u2009=\u200913.\n\n<img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/f86466a8ccbb4825331662353153b686b40ab62f.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\nIn the third request (*k*\u2009=\u200910000) Leha asks about the upper left frament 5\u2009\u00d7\u20095 of the parking. Since *k* is big enough, the answer is equal to 93.\n\n<img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/f3fae55460e5237c800c229f19113cd1f4181f3c.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\nIn the last request (*k*\u2009=\u20092) none of the cur's numbers are suitable, so the answer is 0.\n\n<img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/59bf21e74f30e2f3cdbdd55d300500e3e3f9b632.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>"}]}}

In other words, the roads are confusing if some of them form a directed cycle of some towns.\n\nNow ZS the Coder wonders how many sets of roads (there are 2*n* variants) in initial configuration can he choose to flip such that after flipping each road in the set exactly once, the resulting network will not be confusing.\n\nNote that it is allowed that after the flipping there are more than one directed road from some town and possibly some towns with no roads leading out of it, or multiple roads between any pair of cities.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of towns in Udayland.\n\nThe next line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*a**i*<=\u2260<=*i*), *a**i* denotes a road going from town *i* to town *a**i*.. Output specification: Print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of ways to flip some set of the roads so that the resulting whole set of all roads is not confusing. Since this number may be too large, print the answer modulo 109<=+<=7.\nDemo input: ['3\\n2 3 1\\n', '4\\n2 1 1 1\\n', '5\\n2 4 2 5 3\\n'], Demo output: ['6\\n', '8\\n', '28\\n']\nNote: Consider the first sample case. There are 3 towns and 3 roads. The towns are numbered from 1 to 3 and the roads are <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/e5b18c46402af724bd3841d549d5d6f52fc16253.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/29f71c065c3536e88b54429c734103ad3604f68b.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/030fc9181b578c2d906254d38dc56da5554323eb.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> initially. Number the roads 1 to 3 in this order. \n\nThe sets of roads that ZS the Coder can flip (to make them not confusing) are {1},\u2009{2},\u2009{3},\u2009{1,\u20092},\u2009{1,\u20093},\u2009{2,\u20093}. Note that the empty set is invalid because if no roads are flipped, then towns 1,\u20092,\u20093 is form a directed cycle, so it is confusing. Similarly, flipping all roads is confusing too. Thus, there are a total of 6 possible sets ZS the Coder can flip.\n\nThe sample image shows all possible ways of orienting the roads from the first sample such that the network is not confusing.\n\n<img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/2e275877797bea4817665ce9cfb5274b837194bc.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$..

Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$."}]}}

Assume the boat is currently at (*x*,<=*y*).\n -  If the wind blows to the east, the boat will move to (*x*<=+<=1,<=*y*). -  If the wind blows to the south, the boat will move to (*x*,<=*y*<=-<=1). -  If the wind blows to the west, the boat will move to (*x*<=-<=1,<=*y*). -  If the wind blows to the north, the boat will move to (*x*,<=*y*<=+<=1). \nAlternatively, they can hold the boat by the anchor. In this case, the boat stays at (*x*,<=*y*). Given the wind direction for *t* seconds, what is the earliest time they sail to (*e**x*,<=*e**y*)?\nInput specification: The first line contains five integers *t*,<=*s**x*,<=*s**y*,<=*e**x*,<=*e**y* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=105,<=<=-<=109<=\u2264<=*s**x*,<=*s**y*,<=*e**x*,<=*e**y*<=\u2264<=109). The starting location and the ending location will be different.\n\nThe second line contains *t* characters, the *i*-th character is the wind blowing direction at the *i*-th second. It will be one of the four possibilities: \"E\" (east), \"S\" (south), \"W\" (west) and \"N\" (north).. Output specification: If they can reach (*e**x*,<=*e**y*) within *t* seconds, print the earliest time they can achieve it. Otherwise, print \"-1\" (without quotes).\nDemo input: ['5 0 0 1 1\\nSESNW\\n', '10 5 3 3 6\\nNENSWESNEE\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, they can stay at seconds 1, 3, and move at seconds 2, 4.\n\nIn the second sample, they cannot sail to the destination."}]}}

The height of the tower that goes *i*-th (from left to right) in the sequence equals *h**i*. The city mayor decided to rebuild the city to make it beautiful. In a beautiful city all towers are are arranged in non-descending order of their height from left to right.\n\nThe rebuilding consists of performing several (perhaps zero) operations. An operation constitutes using a crane to take any tower and put it altogether on the top of some other neighboring tower. In other words, we can take the tower that stands *i*-th and put it on the top of either the (*i*<=-<=1)-th tower (if it exists), or the (*i*<=+<=1)-th tower (of it exists). The height of the resulting tower equals the sum of heights of the two towers that were put together. After that the two towers can't be split by any means, but more similar operations can be performed on the resulting tower. Note that after each operation the total number of towers on the straight line decreases by 1.\n\nHelp the mayor determine the minimum number of operations required to make the city beautiful.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=5000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of towers in the city.

Also, each card earns some value in points assigned to it: cards with value from two to ten earn from 2 to 10 points, correspondingly. An ace can either earn 1 or 11, whatever the player wishes. The picture cards (king, queen and jack) earn 10 points. The number of points a card earns does not depend on the suit. The rules of the game are very simple.

The problem is that the oven chooses the cake types on its own and Slastyona can't affect it. However, she knows the types and order of *n* cakes the oven is going to bake today. Slastyona has to pack exactly *k* boxes with cakes today, and she has to put in each box several (at least one) cakes the oven produced one right after another (in other words, she has to put in a box a continuous segment of cakes).\n\nSlastyona wants to maximize the total value of all boxes with cakes. Help her determine this maximum possible total value.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=35000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*min*(*n*,<=50))\u00a0\u2013 the number of cakes and the number of boxes, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*)\u00a0\u2013 the types of cakes in the order the oven bakes them.. Output specification: Print the only integer\u00a0\u2013 the maximum total value of all boxes with cakes.\nDemo input: ['4 1\\n1 2 2 1\\n', '7 2\\n1 3 3 1 4 4 4\\n', '8 3\\n7 7 8 7 7 8 1 7\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '5\\n', '6\\n']\nNote: In the first example Slastyona has only one box. She has to put all cakes in it, so that there are two types of cakes in the box, so the value is equal to 2.\n\nIn the second example it is profitable to put the first two cakes in the first box, and all the rest in the second. There are two distinct types in the first box, and three in the second box then, so the total value is 5."}]}}

Until all the pie is handed out, whoever has the decider token will give the next slice of pie to one of the participants, and the decider token to the other participant.

Each pipe has certain direction (water can flow only in this direction and not vice versa), and diameter (which characterizes the maximal amount of water it can handle).\n\nFor each house, there is at most one pipe going into it and at most one pipe going out of it. With the new semester starting, GUC student and dorm resident, Lulu, wants to install tanks and taps at the dorms. For every house with an outgoing water pipe and without an incoming water pipe, Lulu should install a water tank at that house.

Formally: we number all the planets from $1$ to $n$. $1$ is Earth, $n$ is Mars. Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt.

Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons.-  During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining.-  While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. There will be $14$ tons of rocket with fuel after that.-  During landing on Earth, one ton of fuel can land $7$ tons of cargo, so for landing $14$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel.

Write a python script for the following problem: There are *n* banks in the city where Vasya lives, they are located in a circle, such that any two banks are neighbouring if their indices differ by no more than 1. Also, bank 1 and bank *n* are neighbours if *n*<=&gt;<=1. No bank is a neighbour of itself.\n\nVasya has an account in each bank. Its balance may be negative, meaning Vasya owes some money to this bank.\n\nThere is only one type of operations available: transfer some amount of money from any bank to account in any neighbouring bank. There are no restrictions on the size of the sum being transferred or balance requirements to perform this operation.\n\nVasya doesn't like to deal with large numbers, so he asks you to determine the minimum number of operations required to change the balance of each bank account to zero. It's guaranteed, that this is possible to achieve, that is, the total balance of Vasya in all banks is equal to zero.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of banks.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a**i* (<=-<=109<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109), the *i*-th of them is equal to the initial balance of the account in the *i*-th bank.

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently Ivan noticed an array *a* while debugging his code. Now Ivan can't remember this array, but the bug he was trying to fix didn't go away, so Ivan thinks that the data from this array might help him to reproduce the bug.\n\nIvan clearly remembers that there were *n* elements in the array, and each element was not less than 1 and not greater than *n*. Also he remembers *q* facts about the array. There are two types of facts that Ivan remembers:\n -  1 *l**i* *r**i* *v**i* \u2014 for each *x* such that *l**i*<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*r**i* *a**x*<=\u2265<=*v**i*; -  2 *l**i* *r**i* *v**i* \u2014 for each *x* such that *l**i*<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*r**i* *a**x*<=\u2264<=*v**i*. \nAlso Ivan thinks that this array was a permutation, but he is not so sure about it. He wants to restore some array that corresponds to the *q* facts that he remembers and is very similar to permutation. Formally, Ivan has denoted the *cost* of array as follows:\n\n, where *cnt*(*i*) is the number of occurences of *i* in the array.\n\nHelp Ivan to determine minimum possible *cost* of the array that corresponds to the facts!\nInput specification: The first line contains two integer numbers *n* and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50, 0<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=100).\n\nThen *q* lines follow, each representing a fact about the array. *i*-th line contains the numbers *t**i*, *l**i*, *r**i* and *v**i* for *i*-th fact (1<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=2, 1<=\u2264<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, 1<=\u2264<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, *t**i* denotes the type of the fact)..
