Many people will surely be willing to visit this splendid shrine of high culture.\n\nIn Mainframe a standard pack of 52 cards is used to play blackjack.

Also, each card earns some value in points assigned to it: cards with value from two to ten earn from 2 to 10 points, correspondingly. An ace can either earn 1 or 11, whatever the player wishes. The picture cards (king, queen and jack) earn 10 points. The number of points a card earns does not depend on the suit. The rules of the game are very simple. The player gets two cards, if the sum of points of those cards equals *n*, then the player wins, otherwise the player loses.\n\nThe player has already got the first card, it's the queen of spades.

As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1.

Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through. Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...\"\n\nMore formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of *n* grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:\n -  *m* grains are brought to the barn. If *m* grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account). -  Sparrows come and eat grain.

It's full, so nothing happens. -  At the end of the first day one sparrow comes and eats one grain, so 5\u2009-\u20091\u2009=\u20094 grains remain. -  At the beginning of the second day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full and one grain doesn't fit to it. -  At the end of the second day two sparrows come. 5\u2009-\u20092\u2009=\u20093 grains remain. -  At the beginning of the third day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full again. -  At the end of the third day three sparrows come and eat grain. 5\u2009-\u20093\u2009=\u20092 grains remain. -  At the beginning of the fourth day grain is brought again. 2\u2009+\u20092\u2009=\u20094 grains remain. -  At the end of the fourth day four sparrows come and eat grain. 4\u2009-\u20094\u2009=\u20090 grains remain.

A palindromic number is another matter. It is aesthetically pleasing, and it has a number of remarkable properties. Help Rikhail to convince the scientific community in this!\n\nLet us remind you that a number is called prime if it is integer larger than one, and is not divisible by any positive integer other than itself and one.\n\nRikhail calls a number a palindromic if it is integer, positive, and its decimal representation without leading zeros is a palindrome, i.e. reads the same from left to right and right to left.\n\nOne problem with prime numbers is that there are too many of them. Let's introduce the following notation: \u03c0(*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of primes no larger than *n*, *rub*(*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of palindromic numbers no larger than *n*.

How many ways there are to steal exactly one cookie bag so that the total number of cookies in the remaining bags was even?\nInput specification: The first line contains the only integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of cookie bags Anna and Maria have. The second line contains *n* integers *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of cookies in the *i*-th bag.. Output specification: Print in the only line the only number \u2014 the sought number of ways. If there are no such ways print 0.\nDemo input: ['1\\n1\\n', '10\\n1 2 2 3 4 4 4 2 2 2\\n', '11\\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 99\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '8\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: In the first sample Olga should take the only bag so that the twins ended up with the even number of cookies.\n\nIn the second sample Olga can take any of five bags with two cookies or any of three bags with four cookies \u2014 5\u2009+\u20093\u2009=\u20098 ways in total.\n\nIn the third sample, no matter which bag with two cookies Olga chooses, the twins are left with 2\u2009*\u20099\u2009+\u200999\u2009=\u2009117 cookies. Thus, Olga has only one option: to take the bag with 99 cookies."}]}}

Vertex 1 is the root of the tree, each of the *n*<=-<=1 remaining vertices has a parent in the tree. Vertex is connected with its parent by an edge. The parent of vertex *i* is vertex *p**i*, the parent index is always less than the index of the vertex (i.e., *p**i*<=&lt;<=*i*).\n\nThe depth of the vertex is the number of nodes on the path from the root to *v* along the edges. In particular, the depth of the root is equal to 1.\n\nWe say that vertex *u* is in the subtree of vertex *v*, if we can get from *u* to *v*, moving from the vertex to the parent. In particular, vertex *v* is in its subtree.\n\nRoma gives you *m* queries, the *i*-th of which consists of two numbers *v**i*, *h**i*. Let's consider the vertices in the subtree *v**i* located at depth *h**i*. Determine whether you can use the letters written at these vertices to make a string that is a palindrome. The letters that are written in the vertexes, can be rearranged in any order to make a palindrome, but all letters should be used.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n*, *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=500<=000) \u2014 the number of nodes in the tree and queries, respectively.\n\nThe following line contains *n*<=-<=1 integers *p*2,<=*p*3,<=...,<=*p**n* \u2014 the parents of vertices from the second to the *n*-th (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=&lt;<=*i*).\n\nThe next line contains *n* lowercase English letters, the *i*-th of these letters is written on vertex *i*.\n\nNext *m* lines describe the queries, the *i*-th line contains two numbers *v**i*, *h**i* (1<=\u2264<=*v**i*,<=*h**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the vertex and the depth that appear in the *i*-th query..

Flowrisa is a town where there are many strong-scent flowers, and Beetopia is another town where many bees live. In particular, Kuro will avoid any pair of towns $(u, v)$ if on the path from $u$ to $v$, he reaches Beetopia after he reached Flowrisa, since the bees will be attracted with the flower smell on Kuro\u2019s body and sting him.\n\nKuro wants to know how many pair of city $(u, v)$ he can take as his route.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.

The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs.

Write a python script for the following problem: The ancient Berlanders believed that the longer the name, the more important its bearer is. Thus, Berland kings were famous for their long names. But long names are somewhat inconvenient, so the Berlanders started to abbreviate the names of their kings. They called every king by the first letters of its name. Thus, the king, whose name was Victorious Vasily Pupkin, was always called by the berlanders VVP.\n\nIn Berland over its long history many dynasties of kings replaced each other, but they were all united by common traditions. Thus, according to one Berland traditions, to maintain stability in the country, the first name of the heir should be the same as the last name his predecessor (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the heir coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the predecessor). Berlanders appreciate stability, so this tradition has never been broken. Also Berlanders like perfection, so another tradition requires that the first name of the first king in the dynasty coincides with the last name of the last king in this dynasty (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the first king coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the last king). This tradition, of course, has also been always observed.\n\nThe name of a dynasty is formed by very simple rules: we take all the short names of the kings in the order in which they ruled, and write them in one line. Thus, a dynasty of kings \"ab\" and \"ba\" is called \"abba\", and the dynasty, which had only the king \"abca\", is called \"abca\".\n\nVasya, a historian, has recently found a list of abbreviated names of all Berland kings and their relatives. Help Vasya to find the maximally long name of the dynasty that could have existed in Berland.\n\nNote that in his list all the names are ordered by the time, that is, if name *A* is earlier in the list than *B*, then if *A* and *B* were kings, then king *A* ruled before king *B*.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=5\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of names in Vasya's list.

There is no way to make the whole sequence equal to [1 1 1 1 1].\n\nIn the second case, flipping only the second and the third element (*i*\u2009=\u20092,\u2009*j*\u2009=\u20093) will turn all numbers into 1."}]}}
