Today, a professor told his students that the grades for his course would be given out automatically \u00a0\u2014 he would calculate the simple average (arithmetic mean) of all grades given out for lab works this term and round to the nearest integer. The rounding would be done in favour of the student\u00a0\u2014 $4.5$ would be rounded up to $5$ (as in example 3), but $4.4$ would be rounded down to $4$.\n\nThis does not bode well for Vasya who didn't think those lab works would influence anything, so he may receive a grade worse than $5$ (maybe even the dreaded $2$). However, the professor allowed him to redo some of his works of Vasya's choosing to increase his average grade. Vasya wants to redo as as few lab works as possible in order to get $5$ for the course. Of course, Vasya will get $5$ for the lab works he chooses to redo.\n\nHelp Vasya\u00a0\u2014 calculate the minimum amount of lab works Vasya has to redo.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer $n$\u00a0\u2014 the number of Vasya's grades ($1 \\leq n \\leq 100$).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers from $2$ to $5$\u00a0\u2014 Vasya's grades for his lab works.. Output specification: Output a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum amount of lab works that Vasya has to redo. It can be shown that Vasya can always redo enough lab works to get a $5$.\nDemo input: ['3\\n4 4 4\\n', '4\\n5 4 5 5\\n', '4\\n5 3 3 5\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '0\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, it is enough to redo two lab works to make two $4$s into $5$s.\n\nIn the second sample, Vasya's average is already $4.75$ so he doesn't have to redo anything to get a $5$.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya has to redo one lab work to get rid of one of the $3$s, that will make the average exactly $4.5$ so the final grade would be $5$."}]}}

He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.\n\nOne day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.\nInput specification: There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number.

Write a python script for the following problem: Xenia the beginner programmer has a sequence *a*, consisting of 2*n* non-negative integers: *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a*2*n*. Xenia is currently studying bit operations. To better understand how they work, Xenia decided to calculate some value *v* for *a*.\n\nNamely, it takes several iterations to calculate value *v*. At the first iteration, Xenia writes a new sequence *a*1\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*2,<=*a*3\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*4,<=...,<=*a*2*n*<=-<=1\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*2*n*, consisting of 2*n*<=-<=1 elements. In other words, she writes down the bit-wise OR of adjacent elements of sequence *a*. At the second iteration, Xenia writes the bitwise exclusive OR of adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the first iteration. At the third iteration Xenia writes the bitwise OR of the adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the second iteration. And so on; the operations of bitwise exclusive OR and bitwise OR alternate. In the end, she obtains a sequence consisting of one element, and that element is *v*.\n\nLet's consider an example. Suppose that sequence *a*<==<=(1,<=2,<=3,<=4). Then let's write down all the transformations (1,<=2,<=3,<=4) <=\u2192<= (1\u00a0*or*\u00a02<==<=3,<=3\u00a0*or*\u00a04<==<=7) <=\u2192<= (3\u00a0*xor*\u00a07<==<=4). The result is *v*<==<=4.\n\nYou are given Xenia's initial sequence. But to calculate value *v* for a given sequence would be too easy, so you are given additional *m* queries. Each query is a pair of integers *p*,<=*b*. Query *p*,<=*b* means that you need to perform the assignment *a**p*<==<=*b*. After each query, you need to print the new value *v* for the new sequence *a*.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=17,<=1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105).

He has invented an algorithm and called it \"Mishka's Adjacent Replacements Algorithm\". This algorithm can be represented as a sequence of steps:\n -  Replace each occurrence of $1$ in the array $a$ with $2$; -  Replace each occurrence of $2$ in the array $a$ with $1$; -  Replace each occurrence of $3$ in the array $a$ with $4$; -  Replace each occurrence of $4$ in the array $a$ with $3$; -  Replace each occurrence of $5$ in the array $a$ with $6$; -  Replace each occurrence of $6$ in the array $a$ with $5$; -  $\\dots$ -  Replace each occurrence of $10^9 - 1$ in the array $a$ with $10^9$; -  Replace each occurrence of $10^9$ in the array $a$ with $10^9 - 1$. \nNote that the dots in the middle of this algorithm mean that Mishka applies these replacements for each pair of adjacent integers ($2i - 1, 2i$) for each $i \\in\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 5 \\cdot 10^8\\}$ as described above.\n\nFor example, for the array $a = [1, 2, 4, 5, 10]$, the following sequence of arrays represents the algorithm: \n\n$[1, 2, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $1$ with $2$) $\\rightarrow$ $[2, 2, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $2$ with $1$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $3$ with $4$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $4$ with $3$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $5$ with $6$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 6, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $6$ with $5$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ $\\dots$ $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $10$ with $9$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 9]$. The later steps of the algorithm do not change the array.\n\nMishka is very lazy and he doesn't want to apply these changes by himself. But he is very interested in their result. Help him find it.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains one integer number $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of elements in Mishka's birthday present (surprisingly, an array).\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the elements of the array..

Write a python script for the following problem: It's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.\n\nRecently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.\n\nBeing defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.\n\nEach door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number *a*. The second part is either an integer number *b* or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer *c* and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.\n\n*c* is an integer written in base *a*, to open the door we should write it in base *b*. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!\n\nHere's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:\n\nRoman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.:\n-  I=1-  V=5-  X=10-  L=50-  C=100-  D=500-  M=1000\nSymbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1,<=000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.\n\nAlso in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\n\nHelp Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *a* and *b* (2<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=25). Only *b* may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer *c* in base *a* which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. \n\nIt is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0.

For example, we get the sequence [1,<=2,<=1] after the first step, the sequence [1,<=2,<=1,<=3,<=1,<=2,<=1] after the second step.\n\nThe task is to find the value of the element with index *k* (the elements are numbered from 1) in the obtained sequence, i.\u00a0e. after (*n*<=-<=1) steps.\n\nPlease help Chloe to solve the problem!\nInput specification: The only line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=2*n*<=-<=1)..

Due to persistent research in this area the scientists managed to find out that the Berland chronology starts from the moment when the first two people came to that land (it is considered to have happened in the first year). After one Berland year after the start of the chronology the population had already equaled 13 people (the second year). However, tracing the population number during the following years was an ultimately difficult task, still it was found out that if *d**i* \u2014 the number of people in Berland in the year of *i*, then either *d**i*<==<=12*d**i*<=-<=2, or *d**i*<==<=13*d**i*<=-<=1<=-<=12*d**i*<=-<=2. Of course no one knows how many people are living in Berland at the moment, but now we can tell if there could possibly be a year in which the country population equaled *A*. That's what we ask you to determine. Also, if possible, you have to find out in which years it could be (from the beginning of Berland chronology). Let's suppose that it could be in the years of *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**k*. Then you have to define how many residents could be in the country during those years apart from the *A* variant.

Output specification: On the first output line print YES, if there could be a year in which the total population of the country equaled *A*, otherwise print NO. \n\nIf the answer is YES, then you also have to print number *k* \u2014 the number of years in which the population could equal *A*. On the next line you have to output precisely *k* space-separated numbers \u2014 *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**k*. Those numbers have to be output in the increasing order.\n\nOn the next line you should output number *p* \u2014 how many variants of the number of people could be in the years of *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**k*, apart from the *A* variant. On each of the next *p* lines you have to print one number \u2014 the sought number of residents. Those number also have to go in the increasing order. \n\nIf any number (or both of them) *k* or *p* exceeds 1000, then you have to print 1000 instead of it and only the first 1000 possible answers in the increasing order.\n\nThe numbers should have no leading zeros.\nDemo input: ['2\\n', '3\\n', '13\\n', '1729\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n', 'NO\\n', 'YES\\n1\\n2\\n0\\n', 'YES\\n1\\n4\\n1\\n156\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

So *n* is a number such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nIn the picture you can see a complete binary tree with *n*<==<=15.\n\nVertices are numbered from 1 to *n* in a special recursive way: we recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the left subtree (if current vertex is not a leaf), then assign a number to the current vertex, and then recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the right subtree (if it exists). In the picture vertices are numbered exactly using this algorithm. It is clear that for each size of a complete binary tree exists exactly one way to give numbers to all vertices. This way of numbering is called symmetric.\n\nYou have to write a program that for given *n* answers *q* queries to the tree.\n\nEach query consists of an integer number *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) and a string *s**i*, where *u**i* is the number of vertex, and *s**i* represents the path starting from this vertex. String *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U', which mean traverse to the left child, to the right child and to the parent, respectively. Characters from *s**i* have to be processed from left to right, considering that *u**i* is the vertex where the path starts. If it's impossible to process a character (for example, to go to the left child of a leaf), then you have to skip it. The answer is the number of vertex where the path represented by *s**i* ends.\n\nFor example, if *u**i*<==<=4 and *s**i*<==<=\u00abUURL\u00bb, then the answer is 10.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integer numbers *n* and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1018, *q*<=\u2265<=1). *n* is such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nThe next 2*q* lines represent queries; each query consists of two consecutive lines. The first of these two lines contains *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*), the second contains non-empty string *s**i*. *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of *s**i* (for each *i* such that 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*q*) doesn't exceed 105.. Output specification: Print *q* numbers, *i*-th number must be the answer to the *i*-th query.\nDemo input: ['15 2\\n4\\nUURL\\n8\\nLRLLLLLLLL\\n'], Demo output: ['10\\n5\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

For example, 0, 99, 10110 are beautiful numbers, and 00, 03, 122 are not.\n\nWrite a program which for the given *n* will find a beautiful number such that *n* can be transformed into this number by erasing as few digits as possible. You can erase an arbitraty set of digits. For example, they don't have to go one after another in the number *n*.\n\nIf it's impossible to obtain a beautiful number, print -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains *n* \u2014 a positive integer number without leading zeroes (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=&lt;<=10100000).. Output specification: Print one number \u2014 any beautiful number obtained by erasing as few as possible digits. If there is no answer, print <=-<=1.\nDemo input: ['1033\\n', '10\\n', '11\\n'], Demo output: ['33\\n', '0\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: In the first example it is enough to erase only the first digit to obtain a multiple of 3. But if we erase the first digit, then we obtain a number with a leading zero. So the minimum number of digits to be erased is two."}]}}

In other words, if the sum of sizes of non-blocked holes is $S$, and the $i$-th hole is not blocked, $\\frac{s_i \\cdot A}{S}$ liters of water will flow out of it.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of holes Arkady should block to make at least $B$ liters of water flow out of the first hole?\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers $n$, $A$, $B$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000$, $1 \\le B \\le A \\le 10^4$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of holes, the volume of water Arkady will pour into the system, and the volume he wants to get out of the first hole.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$ ($1 \\le s_i \\le 10^4$)\u00a0\u2014 the sizes of the holes.. Output specification: Print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of holes Arkady should block.\nDemo input: ['4 10 3\\n2 2 2 2\\n', '4 80 20\\n3 2 1 4\\n', '5 10 10\\n1000 1 1 1 1\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '0\\n', '4\\n']\nNote: In the first example Arkady should block at least one hole. After that, $\\frac{10 \\cdot 2}{6} \\approx 3.333$ liters of water will flow out of the first hole, and that suits Arkady.\n\nIn the second example even without blocking any hole, $\\frac{80 \\cdot 3}{10} = 24$ liters will flow out of the first hole, that is not less than $20$.\n\nIn the third example Arkady has to block all holes except the first to make all water flow out of the first hole."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: There is a programming language in which every program is a non-empty sequence of \"&lt;\" and \"&gt;\" signs and digits. Let's explain how the interpreter of this programming language works. A program is interpreted using movement of instruction pointer (IP) which consists of two parts.\n -  Current character pointer (CP); -  Direction pointer (DP) which can point left or right; \nInitially CP points to the leftmost character of the sequence and DP points to the right.\n\nWe repeat the following steps until the first moment that CP points to somewhere outside the sequence.\n -  If CP is pointing to a digit the interpreter prints that digit then CP moves one step according to the direction of DP. After that the value of the printed digit in the sequence decreases by one. If the printed digit was 0 then it cannot be decreased therefore it's erased from the sequence and the length of the sequence decreases by one. -  If CP is pointing to \"&lt;\" or \"&gt;\" then the direction of DP changes to \"left\" or \"right\" correspondingly. Then CP moves one step according to DP. If the new character that CP is pointing to is \"&lt;\" or \"&gt;\" then the previous character will be erased from the sequence. \nIf at any moment the CP goes outside of the sequence the execution is terminated.\n\nIt's obvious the every program in this language terminates after some steps.\n\nWe have a sequence *s*1,<=*s*2,<=...,<=*s**n* of \"&lt;\", \"&gt;\" and digits. You should answer *q* queries. Each query gives you *l* and *r* and asks how many of each digit will be printed if we run the sequence *s**l*,<=*s**l*<=+<=1,<=...,<=*s**r* as an independent program in this language.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains two integers *n* and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*q*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 represents the length of the sequence *s* and the number of queries. \n\nThe second line contains *s*, a sequence of \"&lt;\", \"&gt;\" and digits (0..9) written from left to right. Note, that the characters of *s* are not separated with spaces. \n\nThe next *q* lines each contains two integers *l**i* and *r**i* (1<=\u2264<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the *i*-th query..

Write a python script for the following problem: Oleg writes down the history of the days he lived. For each day he decides if it was good or bad. Oleg calls a non-empty sequence of days a zebra, if it starts with a bad day, ends with a bad day, and good and bad days are alternating in it. Let us denote bad days as 0 and good days as 1. Then, for example, sequences of days 0, 010, 01010 are zebras, while sequences 1, 0110, 0101 are not.\n\nOleg tells you the story of days he lived in chronological order in form of string consisting of 0 and 1. Now you are interested if it is possible to divide Oleg's life history into several subsequences, each of which is a zebra, and the way it can be done. Each day must belong to exactly one of the subsequences. For each of the subsequences, days forming it must be ordered chronologically. Note that subsequence does not have to be a group of consecutive days.\nInput specification: In the only line of input data there is a non-empty string *s* consisting of characters 0 and 1, which describes the history of Oleg's life. Its length (denoted as |*s*|) does not exceed 200<=000 characters.. Output specification: If there is a way to divide history into zebra subsequences, in the first line of output you should print an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=|*s*|), the resulting number of subsequences. In the *i*-th of following *k* lines first print the integer *l**i* (1<=\u2264<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=|*s*|), which is the length of the *i*-th subsequence, and then *l**i* indices of days forming the subsequence. Indices must follow in ascending order. Days are numbered starting from 1. Each index from 1 to *n* must belong to exactly one subsequence. If there is no way to divide day history into zebra subsequences, print -1.\n\nSubsequences may be printed in any order. If there are several solutions, you may print any of them. You do not have to minimize nor maximize the value of *k*.\nDemo input: ['0010100\\n', '111\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n3 1 3 4\\n3 2 5 6\\n1 7\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

In each round, Andrew and Jerry draw randomly without replacement from a jar containing *n* balls, each labeled with a distinct positive integer. Without looking, they hand their balls to Harry, who awards the point to the player with the larger number and returns the balls to the jar. The winner of the game is the one who wins at least two of the three rounds.\n\nAndrew wins rounds 1 and 2 while Jerry wins round 3, so Andrew wins the game. However, Jerry is unhappy with this system, claiming that he will often lose the match despite having the higher overall total.

That is a problem for the organizers because they want a winner. \n\nWhile watching previous races the organizers have noticed that Willman can perform only steps of length equal to *w* meters, and Bolt can perform only steps of length equal to *b* meters. Organizers decided to slightly change the rules of the race. Now, at the end of the racetrack there will be an abyss, and the winner will be declared the athlete, who manages to run farther from the starting point of the the racetrack (which is not the subject to change by any of the athletes). \n\nNote that none of the athletes can run infinitely far, as they both will at some moment of time face the point, such that only one step further will cause them to fall in the abyss. In other words, the athlete will not fall into the abyss if the total length of all his steps will be less or equal to the chosen distance *L*.\n\nSince the organizers are very fair, the are going to set the length of the racetrack as an integer chosen randomly and uniformly in range from 1 to *t* (both are included). What is the probability that Willman and Bolt tie again today?\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains three integers *t*, *w* and *b* (1<=\u2264<=*t*,<=*w*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=5\u00b71018) \u2014 the maximum possible length of the racetrack, the length of Willman's steps and the length of Bolt's steps respectively.. Output specification: Print the answer to the problem as an irreducible fraction . Follow the format of the samples output.\n\nThe fraction  (*p* and *q* are integers, and both *p*<=\u2265<=0 and *q*<=&gt;<=0 holds) is called irreducible, if there is no such integer *d*<=&gt;<=1, that both *p* and *q* are divisible by *d*.\nDemo input: ['10 3 2\\n', '7 1 2\\n'], Demo output: ['3/10\\n', '3/7\\n']\nNote: In the first sample Willman and Bolt will tie in case 1, 6 or 7 are chosen as the length of the racetrack."}]}}

The grandmother has a large garden, which can be represented as a rectangle 1<=\u00d7<=*n* in size, when viewed from above. This rectangle is divided into *n* equal square sections. The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.\n\nCreating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section. At that, the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section. That is, for example, the garden can be represented by a 1<=\u00d7<=5 rectangle, where the section heights are equal to 4, 2, 3, 3, 2.

To please the *i*-th client, Valera needs to give him everything he wants, that is, to make *x**i* low quality photos and *y**i* high quality photos. To make one low quality photo, the camera must have at least *a* megabytes of free memory space.

Write a python script for the following problem: *T* is a complete binary tree consisting of *n* vertices. It means that exactly one vertex is a root, and each vertex is either a leaf (and doesn't have children) or an inner node (and has exactly two children). All leaves of a complete binary tree have the same depth (distance from the root). So *n* is a number such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nIn the picture you can see a complete binary tree with *n*<==<=15.\n\nVertices are numbered from 1 to *n* in a special recursive way: we recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the left subtree (if current vertex is not a leaf), then assign a number to the current vertex, and then recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the right subtree (if it exists). In the picture vertices are numbered exactly using this algorithm. It is clear that for each size of a complete binary tree exists exactly one way to give numbers to all vertices. This way of numbering is called symmetric.\n\nYou have to write a program that for given *n* answers *q* queries to the tree.\n\nEach query consists of an integer number *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) and a string *s**i*, where *u**i* is the number of vertex, and *s**i* represents the path starting from this vertex. String *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U', which mean traverse to the left child, to the right child and to the parent, respectively. Characters from *s**i* have to be processed from left to right, considering that *u**i* is the vertex where the path starts. If it's impossible to process a character (for example, to go to the left child of a leaf), then you have to skip it. The answer is the number of vertex where the path represented by *s**i* ends.\n\nFor example, if *u**i*<==<=4 and *s**i*<==<=\u00abUURL\u00bb, then the answer is 10.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integer numbers *n* and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1018, *q*<=\u2265<=1). *n* is such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nThe next 2*q* lines represent queries; each query consists of two consecutive lines. The first of these two lines contains *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*), the second contains non-empty string *s**i*. *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of *s**i* (for each *i* such that 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*q*) doesn't exceed 105.. Output specification: Print *q* numbers, *i*-th number must be the answer to the *i*-th query.\nDemo input: ['15 2\\n4\\nUURL\\n8\\nLRLLLLLLLL\\n'], Demo output: ['10\\n5\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, Dima met with Sasha in a philatelic store, and since then they are collecting coins together. Their favorite occupation is to sort collections of coins. Sasha likes having things in order, that is why he wants his coins to be arranged in a row in such a way that firstly come coins out of circulation, and then come coins still in circulation. \n\nFor arranging coins Dima uses the following algorithm. One step of his algorithm looks like the following:\n 1.  He looks through all the coins from left to right; 1.  If he sees that the *i*-th coin is still in circulation, and (*i*<=+<=1)-th coin is already out of circulation, he exchanges these two coins and continues watching coins from (*i*<=+<=1)-th. \nDima repeats the procedure above until it happens that no two coins were exchanged during this procedure. Dima calls hardness of ordering the number of steps required for him according to the algorithm above to sort the sequence, e.g. the number of times he looks through the coins from the very beginning. For example, for the ordered sequence hardness of ordering equals one.\n\nToday Sasha invited Dima and proposed him a game. First he puts *n* coins in a row, all of them are out of circulation. Then Sasha chooses one of the coins out of circulation and replaces it with a coin in circulation for *n* times. During this process Sasha constantly asks Dima what is the hardness of ordering of the sequence. \n\nThe task is more complicated because Dima should not touch the coins and he should determine hardness of ordering in his mind. Help Dima with this task.\nInput specification: The first line contains single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=300<=000)\u00a0\u2014 number of coins that Sasha puts behind Dima.\n\nSecond line contains *n* distinct integers *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=*n*)\u00a0\u2014 positions that Sasha puts coins in circulation to.

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$..

Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$."}]}}

When you push some button, it either stays pressed into the lock (that means that you've guessed correctly and pushed the button that goes next in the sequence), or all pressed buttons return to the initial position. When all buttons are pressed into the lock at once, the lock opens.\n\nConsider an example with three buttons. Let's say that the opening sequence is: {2, 3, 1}. If you first press buttons 1 or 3, the buttons unpress immediately. If you first press button 2, it stays pressed. If you press 1 after 2, all buttons unpress. If you press 3 after 2, buttons 3 and 2 stay pressed. As soon as you've got two pressed buttons, you only need to press button 1 to open the lock.\n\nManao doesn't know the opening sequence. But he is really smart and he is going to act in the optimal way. Calculate the number of times he's got to push a button in order to open the lock in the worst-case scenario.\nInput specification: A single line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2000) \u2014 the number of buttons the lock has.. Output specification: In a single line print the number of times Manao has to push a button in the worst-case scenario.\nDemo input: ['2\\n', '3\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n', '7\\n']\nNote: Consider the first test sample. Manao can fail his first push and push the wrong button. In this case he will already be able to guess the right one with his second push. And his third push will push the second right button. Thus, in the worst-case scenario he will only need 3 pushes."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Beroffice text editor has a wide range of features that help working with text. One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.\n\nBeroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.\n\nFor example:\n -  the following words have typos: \"hellno\", \"hackcerrs\" and \"backtothefutttture\"; -  the following words don't have typos: \"helllllooooo\", \"tobeornottobe\" and \"oooooo\". \nWhen Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.\n\nImplement this feature of Beroffice editor. Consider the following letters as the only vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'. All the other letters are consonants in this problem.\nInput specification: The only line contains a non-empty word consisting of small English letters.

Both strings consist only of lowercase English letters.. Output specification: If Santa is wrong, and there is no way to divide some of keys into pairs and swap keys in each pair so that the keyboard will be fixed, print \u00ab-1\u00bb (without quotes).\n\nOtherwise, the first line of output should contain the only integer *k* (*k*<=\u2265<=0)\u00a0\u2014 the number of pairs of keys that should be swapped. The following *k* lines should contain two space-separated letters each, denoting the keys which should be swapped. All printed letters must be distinct.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, print any of them. You are free to choose the order of the pairs and the order of keys in a pair.\n\nEach letter must occur at most once. Santa considers the keyboard to be fixed if he can print his favorite patter without mistakes.\nDemo input: ['helloworld\\nehoolwlroz\\n', 'hastalavistababy\\nhastalavistababy\\n', 'merrychristmas\\nchristmasmerry\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\nh e\\nl o\\nd z\\n', '0\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

The system will answer \"yes\" if your integer is a divisor of the hidden number. Otherwise, the answer will be \"no\".\n\nFor example, if the hidden number is 14 then the system will answer \"yes\" only if you print 2, 7 or 14.\n\nWhen you are done asking queries, print \"prime\" or \"composite\" and terminate your program.\n\nYou will get the Wrong Answer verdict if you ask more than 20 queries, or if you print an integer not from the range [2,<=100]. Also, you will get the Wrong Answer verdict if the printed answer isn't correct.\n\nYou will get the Idleness Limit Exceeded verdict if you don't print anything (but you should) or if you forget about flushing the output (more info below).\nInput specification: After each query you should read one string from the input. It will be \"yes\" if the printed integer is a divisor of the hidden number, and \"no\" otherwise.. Output specification: Up to 20 times you can ask a query\u00a0\u2014 print an integer from interval [2,<=100] in one line. You have to both print the end-of-line character and flush the output. After flushing you should read a response from the input.\n\nIn any moment you can print the answer \"prime\" or \"composite\" (without the quotes). After that, flush the output and terminate your program.\n\nTo flush you can use (just after printing an integer and end-of-line): \n -  fflush(stdout) in C++; -  System.out.flush() in Java; -  stdout.flush() in Python; -  flush(output) in Pascal; -  See the documentation for other languages. \nHacking. To hack someone, as the input you should print the hidden number\u00a0\u2014 one integer from the interval [2,<=100]. Of course, his/her solution won't be able to read the hidden number from the input.\nDemo input: ['yes\\nno\\nyes\\n', 'no\\nyes\\nno\\nno\\nno\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n80\\n5\\ncomposite\\n', '58\\n59\\n78\\n78\\n2\\nprime\\n']\nNote: The hidden number in the first query is 30. In a table below you can see a better form of the provided example of the communication process.\n\n<img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/ea790051c34ea7d2761cd9b096412ca7c647a173.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\nThe hidden number is divisible by both 2 and 5. Thus, it must be composite. Note that it isn't necessary to know the exact value of the hidden number. In this test, the hidden number is 30.\n\n<img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/35c6952617fa94ec3e0ea8e63aa1c3c49b3ba420.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\n59 is a divisor of the hidden number. In the interval [2,\u2009100] there is only one number with this divisor. The hidden number must be 59, which is prime. Note that the answer is known even after the second query and you could print it then and terminate. Though, it isn't forbidden to ask unnecessary queries (unless you exceed the limit of 20 queries)."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: The \"Bulls and Cows\" game needs two people to play. The thinker thinks of a number and the guesser tries to guess it.\n\nThe thinker thinks of a four-digit number in the decimal system. All the digits in the number are different and the number may have a leading zero. It can't have more than one leading zero, because all it's digits should be different. The guesser tries to guess the number. He makes a series of guesses, trying experimental numbers and receives answers from the first person in the format \"*x* bulls *y* cows\". *x* represents the number of digits in the experimental number that occupy the same positions as in the sought number. *y* represents the number of digits of the experimental number that present in the sought number, but occupy different positions. Naturally, the experimental numbers, as well as the sought number, are represented by four-digit numbers where all digits are different and a leading zero can be present.\n\nFor example, let's suppose that the thinker thought of the number 0123. Then the guessers' experimental number 1263 will receive a reply \"1 bull 2 cows\" (3 occupies the same positions in both numbers and 1 and 2 are present in both numbers but they occupy different positions). Also, the answer to number 8103 will be \"2 bulls 1 cow\" (analogically, 1 and 3 occupy the same positions and 0 occupies a different one). \n\nWhen the guesser is answered \"4 bulls 0 cows\", the game is over.\n\nNow the guesser has already made several guesses and wants to know whether his next guess can possibly be the last one.\nInput specification: The first input line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=10) which represents the number of already made guesses.

The experimental numbers are correct, i.e., each of them contains exactly four digits, in each of them all the four digits are different, and there can be a leading zero. All the experimental numbers are different. As the guesser hasn't guessed the number yet, the answer \"4 bulls 0 cows\" is not present.. Output specification: If the input data is enough to determine the sought number, print the number with four digits on a single line. If it has less than four digits, add leading zero.

As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest.

Every race description start with an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50) on a line of itself, where *n* is the number of clasified drivers in the given race. After that *n* lines follow with the classification for the race, each containing the name of a driver. The names of drivers are given in order from the first to the last place. The name of the driver consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters and has length at most 50 characters. Comparing of names should be case-sensetive.. Output specification: Your output should contain exactly two line. On the first line is the name of the champion according to the original rule, and on the second line the name of the champion according to the alternative rule.\nDemo input: ['3\\n3\\nHamilton\\nVettel\\nWebber\\n2\\nWebber\\nVettel\\n2\\nHamilton\\nVettel\\n', '2\\n7\\nProst\\nSurtees\\nNakajima\\nSchumacher\\nButton\\nDeLaRosa\\nBuemi\\n8\\nAlonso\\nProst\\nNinoFarina\\nJimClark\\nDeLaRosa\\nNakajima\\nPatrese\\nSurtees\\n'], Demo output: ['Vettel\\nHamilton\\n', 'Prost\\nProst\\n']\nNote: It is not guaranteed that the same drivers participate in all races.

Fox Ciel has *m* cards, each one has these two attributes too. It's known that position of all Ciel's cards is Attack.\n\nNow is Ciel's battle phase, Ciel can do the following operation many times:\n 1.  Choose one of her cards *X*. This card mustn't be chosen before. 1.  If Jiro has no alive cards at that moment, he gets the damage equal to (*X*'s strength). Otherwise, Ciel needs to choose one Jiro's alive card *Y*, then:   If *Y*'s position is Attack, then (*X*'s strength) <=\u2265<= (*Y*'s strength) must hold. After this attack, card *Y* dies, and Jiro gets the damage equal to (*X*'s strength) - (*Y*'s strength). 1.  If *Y*'s position is Defense, then (*X*'s strength) <=&gt;<= (*Y*'s strength) must hold. After this attack, card *Y* dies, but Jiro gets no damage.  \nCiel can end her battle phase at any moment (so, she can use not all her cards).

Position is the string \"ATK\" for attack, and the string \"DEF\" for defense.\n\nEach of the next *m* lines contains an integer *strength* (0<=\u2264<=*strength*<=\u2264<=8000) \u2014 the strength of Ciel's current card.. Output specification: Output an integer: the maximal damage Jiro can get.\nDemo input: ['2 3\\nATK 2000\\nDEF 1700\\n2500\\n2500\\n2500\\n', '3 4\\nATK 10\\nATK 100\\nATK 1000\\n1\\n11\\n101\\n1001\\n', '2 4\\nDEF 0\\nATK 0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n'], Demo output: ['3000\\n', '992\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: In the first test case, Ciel has 3 cards with same *strength*. The best strategy is as follows. First she uses one of these 3 cards to attack \"ATK 2000\" card first, this attack destroys that card and Jiro gets 2500\u2009-\u20092000\u2009=\u2009500 damage. Then she uses the second card to destroy the \"DEF 1700\" card. Jiro doesn't get damage that time. Now Jiro has no cards so she can use the third card to attack and Jiro gets 2500 damage. So the answer is 500\u2009+\u20092500\u2009=\u20093000.\n\nIn the second test case, she should use the \"1001\" card to attack the \"ATK 100\" card, then use the \"101\" card to attack the \"ATK 10\" card. Now Ciel still has cards but she can choose to end her battle phase. The total damage equals (1001\u2009-\u2009100)\u2009+\u2009(101\u2009-\u200910)\u2009=\u2009992.\n\nIn the third test case note that she can destroy the \"ATK 0\" card by a card with strength equal to 0, but she can't destroy a \"DEF 0\" card with that card."}]}}

Tanya can't write yet, so she found a newspaper and decided to cut out the letters and glue them into the postcard to achieve string *s*. The newspaper contains string *t*, consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters. We know that the length of string *t* greater or equal to the length of the string *s*.\n\nThe newspaper may possibly have too few of some letters needed to make the text and too many of some other letters. That's why Tanya wants to cut some *n* letters out of the newspaper and make a message of length exactly *n*, so that it looked as much as possible like *s*. If the letter in some position has correct value and correct letter case (in the string *s* and in the string that Tanya will make), then she shouts joyfully \"YAY!\", and if the letter in the given position has only the correct value but it is in the wrong case, then the girl says \"WHOOPS\".\n\nTanya wants to make such message that lets her shout \"YAY!\" as much as possible. If there are multiple ways to do this, then her second priority is to maximize the number of times she says \"WHOOPS\". Your task is to help Tanya make the message.\nInput specification: The first line contains line *s* (1<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105), consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters \u2014 the text of Tanya's message.\n\nThe second line contains line *t* (|*s*|<=\u2264<=|*t*|<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105), consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters \u2014 the text written in the newspaper.\n\nHere |*a*| means the length of the string *a*.. Output specification: Print two integers separated by a space:\n -  the first number is the number of times Tanya shouts \"YAY!\" while making the message, -  the second number is the number of times Tanya says \"WHOOPS\" while making the message.\nDemo input: ['AbC\\nDCbA\\n', 'ABC\\nabc\\n', 'abacaba\\nAbaCaBA\\n'], Demo output: ['3 0\\n', '0 3\\n', '3 4\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: One particularly well-known fact about zombies is that they move and think terribly slowly. While we still don't know why their movements are so sluggish, the problem of laggy thinking has been recently resolved. It turns out that the reason is not (as previously suspected) any kind of brain defect \u2013 it's the opposite! Independent researchers confirmed that the nervous system of a zombie is highly complicated \u2013 it consists of *n* brains (much like a cow has several stomachs). They are interconnected by brain connectors, which are veins capable of transmitting thoughts between brains. There are two important properties such a brain network should have to function properly: \n 1.  It should be possible to exchange thoughts between any two pairs of brains (perhaps indirectly, through other brains). 1.  There should be no redundant brain connectors, that is, removing any brain connector would make property 1 false. \nIf both properties are satisfied, we say that the nervous system is valid. Unfortunately (?), if the system is not valid, the zombie stops thinking and becomes (even more) dead. Your task is to analyze a given nervous system of a zombie and find out whether it is valid.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000) denoting the number of brains (which are conveniently numbered from 1 to *n*) and the number of brain connectors in the nervous system, respectively.

The first was full of blue candies and the second bag was full of red candies. Om Nom knows that each red candy weighs *W**r* grams and each blue candy weighs *W**b* grams. Eating a single red candy gives Om Nom *H**r* joy units and eating a single blue candy gives Om Nom *H**b* joy units.\n\nCandies are the most important thing in the world, but on the other hand overeating is not good. Om Nom knows if he eats more than *C* grams of candies, he will get sick. Om Nom thinks that it isn't proper to leave candy leftovers, so he can only eat a whole candy. Om Nom is a great mathematician and he quickly determined how many candies of what type he should eat in order to get the maximum number of joy units. Can you repeat his achievement?

She can shoot to some cells and after each shot she is told if that cell was a part of some ship (this case is called \"hit\") or not (this case is called \"miss\").\n\nGalya has already made *k* shots, all of them were misses.\n\nYour task is to calculate the minimum number of cells such that if Galya shoot at all of them, she would hit at least one ship.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one valid ships placement.\nInput specification: The first line contains four positive integers *n*, *a*, *b*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105, 1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=*n*, 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the grid, the number of ships on the grid, the length of each ship and the number of shots Galya has already made.\n\nThe second line contains a string of length *n*, consisting of zeros and ones. If the *i*-th character is one, Galya has already made a shot to this cell. Otherwise, she hasn't. It is guaranteed that there are exactly *k* ones in this string.. Output specification: In the first line print the minimum number of cells such that if Galya shoot at all of them, she would hit at least one ship.\n\nIn the second line print the cells Galya should shoot at.\n\nEach cell should be printed exactly once. You can print the cells in arbitrary order. The cells are numbered from 1 to *n*, starting from the left.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\nDemo input: ['5 1 2 1\\n00100\\n', '13 3 2 3\\n1000000010001\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n4 2\\n', '2\\n7 11\\n']\nNote: There is one ship in the first sample. It can be either to the left or to the right from the shot Galya has already made (the \"1\" character). So, it is necessary to make two shots: one at the left part, and one at the right part."}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the elements of array. \n\nThe third line contains integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs. Separate the numbers by spaces.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nDemo input: ['2\\n1 2\\n1\\n1\\n', '2\\n2 1\\n1\\n1\\n', '3\\n3 1 2\\n3\\n1 2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['1 2\\n', '2 1\\n', '6 6\\n']\nNote: In the first sample Vasya's approach will make one comparison (it starts with the 1-st element and immediately finds the required number), and Petya's approach makes two comparisons (first he compares with the 2-nd array element, doesn't find the search item and compares with the 1-st element).\n\nIn the second sample, on the contrary, Vasya's approach will need two comparisons (first with 1-st element, and then with the 2-nd), and Petya's approach will find the required value in one comparison (the first comparison with the 2-nd element)."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Ancient Egyptians are known to have used a large set of symbols  to write on the walls of the temples. Fafa and Fifa went to one of the temples and found two non-empty words *S*1 and *S*2 of equal lengths on the wall of temple written one below the other. Since this temple is very ancient, some symbols from the words were erased. The symbols in the set  have equal probability for being in the position of any erased symbol.\n\nFifa challenged Fafa to calculate the probability that *S*1 is lexicographically greater than *S*2. Can you help Fafa with this task?\n\nYou know that , i.\u00a0e. there were *m* distinct characters in Egyptians' alphabet, in this problem these characters are denoted by integers from 1 to *m* in alphabet order. A word *x* is lexicographically greater than a word *y* of the same length, if the words are same up to some position, and then the word *x* has a larger character, than the word *y*.\n\nWe can prove that the probability equals to some fraction , where *P* and *Q* are coprime integers, and .

But Jack knows on what planet will Apophis land. In order to save his friends, Jack must repeatedly go through stargates to get to this planet.\n\nOverall the galaxy has *n* planets, indexed with numbers from 1 to *n*. Jack is on the planet with index 1, and Apophis will land on the planet with index *n*. Jack can move between some pairs of planets through stargates (he can move in both directions); the transfer takes a positive, and, perhaps, for different pairs of planets unequal number of seconds. Jack begins his journey at time 0.\n\nIt can be that other travellers are arriving to the planet where Jack is currently located. In this case, Jack has to wait for exactly 1 second before he can use the stargate.

You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two.

However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins.

The only limitation that Vasya has \u2014 he does not want to do the same activity on two consecutive days: it means, he will not do sport on two consecutive days, and write the contest on two consecutive days.\nInput specification: The first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of days of Vasya's vacations.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence of integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=3) separated by space, where: \n -  *a**i* equals 0, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is closed and the contest is not carried out; -  *a**i* equals 1, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is closed, but the contest is carried out; -  *a**i* equals 2, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is open and the contest is not carried out; -  *a**i* equals 3, if on the *i*-th day of vacations the gym is open and the contest is carried out.. Output specification: Print the minimum possible number of days on which Vasya will have a rest. Remember that Vasya refuses:\n -  to do sport on any two consecutive days, -  to write the contest on any two consecutive days.\nDemo input: ['4\\n1 3 2 0\\n', '7\\n1 3 3 2 1 2 3\\n', '2\\n2 2\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '0\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: In the first test Vasya can write the contest on the day number 1 and do sport on the day number 3. Thus, he will have a rest for only 2 days.\n\nIn the second test Vasya should write contests on days number 1, 3, 5 and 7, in other days do sport. Thus, he will not have a rest for a single day.\n\nIn the third test Vasya can do sport either on a day number 1 or number 2. He can not do sport in two days, because it will be contrary to the his limitation. Thus, he will have a rest for only one day."}]}}

The computer network of this corporation consists of *n* computers, some of them are connected by a cable. The computers are indexed by integers from 1 to *n*. It's known that any two computers connected by cable directly or through other computers\n\nPolycarpus decided to find out the network's topology. A network topology is the way of describing the network configuration, the scheme that shows the location and the connections of network devices.\n\nPolycarpus knows three main network topologies: bus, ring and star. A bus is the topology that represents a shared cable with all computers connected with it. In the ring topology the cable connects each computer only with two other ones. A star is the topology where all computers of a network are connected to the single central node.\n\nLet's represent each of these network topologies as a connected non-directed graph. A bus is a connected graph that is the only path, that is, the graph where all nodes are connected with two other ones except for some two nodes that are the beginning and the end of the path. A ring is a connected graph, where all nodes are connected with two other ones. A star is a connected graph, where a single central node is singled out and connected with all other nodes. For clarifications, see the picture.\n\nYou've got a connected non-directed graph that characterizes the computer network in Polycarpus' corporation.

The mood can be positive, zero or negative.\n\nLet's define a subarray as a segment of consecutive flowers. The mother suggested some set of subarrays. Alyona wants to choose several of the subarrays suggested by her mother.

Suppose the mother suggested subarrays (1,<=<=-<=2), (3,<=<=-<=4), (1,<=3), (1,<=<=-<=2,<=1,<=3). Then if the girl chooses the third and the fourth subarrays then: \n -  the first flower adds 1\u00b71<==<=1 to the girl's happiness, because he is in one of chosen subarrays, -  the second flower adds (<=-<=2)\u00b71<==<=<=-<=2, because he is in one of chosen subarrays, -  the third flower adds 1\u00b72<==<=2, because he is in two of chosen subarrays, -  the fourth flower adds 3\u00b72<==<=6, because he is in two of chosen subarrays, -  the fifth flower adds (<=-<=4)\u00b70<==<=0, because he is in no chosen subarrays. \nThus, in total 1<=+<=(<=-<=2)<=+<=2<=+<=6<=+<=0<==<=7 is added to the girl's happiness.

Write a python script for the following problem: The research center Q has developed a new multi-core processor. The processor consists of *n* cores and has *k* cells of cache memory. Consider the work of this processor.\n\nAt each cycle each core of the processor gets one instruction: either do nothing, or the number of the memory cell (the core will write an information to the cell). After receiving the command, the core executes it immediately. Sometimes it happens that at one cycle, multiple cores try to write the information into a single cell. Unfortunately, the developers did not foresee the possibility of resolving conflicts between cores, so in this case there is a deadlock: all these cores and the corresponding memory cell are locked forever. Each of the locked cores ignores all further commands, and no core in the future will be able to record an information into the locked cell. If any of the cores tries to write an information into some locked cell, it is immediately locked.\n\nThe development team wants to explore the deadlock situation. Therefore, they need a program that will simulate the processor for a given set of instructions for each core within *m* cycles . You're lucky, this interesting work is entrusted to you. According to the instructions, during the *m* cycles define for each core the number of the cycle, during which it will become locked.

Write a python script for the following problem: Each year in the castle of Dwarven King there is a competition in growing mushrooms among the dwarves. The competition is one of the most prestigious ones, and the winner gets a wooden salad bowl. This year's event brought together the best mushroom growers from around the world, so we had to slightly change the rules so that the event gets more interesting to watch.\n\nEach mushroom grower has a mushroom that he will grow on the competition. Under the new rules, the competition consists of two parts. The first part lasts *t*1 seconds and the second part lasts *t*2 seconds. The first and the second part are separated by a little break.\n\nAfter the starting whistle the first part of the contest starts, and all mushroom growers start growing mushrooms at once, each at his individual speed of *v**i* meters per second. After *t*1 seconds, the mushroom growers stop growing mushrooms and go to have a break. During the break, for unexplained reasons, the growth of all mushrooms is reduced by *k* percent. After the break the second part of the contest starts and all mushrooms growers at the same time continue to grow mushrooms, each at his individual speed of *u**i* meters per second. After a *t*2 seconds after the end of the break, the competition ends. Note that the speeds before and after the break may vary.\n\nBefore the match dwarf Pasha learned from all participants, what two speeds they have chosen. However, the participants did not want to disclose to him all their strategy and therefore, did not say in what order they will be using these speeds. That is, if a participant chose speeds *a**i* and *b**i*, then there are two strategies: he either uses speed *a**i* before the break and speed *b**i* after it, or vice versa.\n\nDwarf Pasha really wants to win the totalizer. He knows that each participant chooses the strategy that maximizes the height of the mushroom. Help Dwarf Pasha make the final table of competition results.\n\nThe participants are sorted in the result table by the mushroom height (the participants with higher mushrooms follow earlier in the table). In case of equal mushroom heights, the participants are sorted by their numbers (the participants with a smaller number follow earlier).\nInput specification: The first input line contains four integer numbers *n*, *t*1, *t*2, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*t*1,<=*t*2<=\u2264<=1000;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of participants, the time before the break, the time after the break and the percentage, by which the mushroom growth drops during the break, correspondingly.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains two integers.

Write a python script for the following problem: To confuse the opponents, the Galactic Empire represents fractions in an unusual format. The fractions are represented as two sets of integers. The product of numbers from the first set gives the fraction numerator, the product of numbers from the second set gives the fraction denominator. However, it turned out that the programs that work with fractions in this representations aren't complete, they lack supporting the operation of reducing fractions.

Let's consider the following model of a company.\n\nThere are *n* people working for the Large Software Company. Each person belongs to some department. Initially, each person works on his own project in his own department (thus, each company initially consists of *n* departments, one person in each).\n\nHowever, harsh times have come to the company and the management had to hire a crisis manager who would rebuild the working process in order to boost efficiency. Let's use *team*(*person*) to represent a team where person *person* works. A crisis manager can make decisions of two types:\n 1.  Merge departments *team*(*x*) and *team*(*y*) into one large department containing all the employees of *team*(*x*) and *team*(*y*), where *x* and *y* (1<=\u2264<=*x*,<=*y*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 are numbers of two of some company employees.

Write a python script for the following problem: Imagine that you have a twin brother or sister. Having another person that looks exactly like you seems very unusual. It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.\n\nNow let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins.

If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too. You can pick coins with values 1,\u20092 or 2,\u20092. In any case, the minimum number of coins equals 2."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: \n -  alloc n \u2014 to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; \nThe memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.\n\nThe first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.\nInput specification: The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100;1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *t* \u2014 the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* \u2014 the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.. Output specification: Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession. Output lines should go in the same order in which the operations are processed. Successful procession of alloc operation should return integers, starting with 1, as the identifiers of the allocated blocks.\nDemo input: ['6 10\\nalloc 5\\nalloc 3\\nerase 1\\nalloc 6\\ndefragment\\nalloc 6\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n2\\nNULL\\n3\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: One day mum asked Petya to sort his toys and get rid of some of them. Petya found a whole box of toy spiders. They were quite dear to him and the boy didn't want to throw them away. Petya conjured a cunning plan: he will glue all the spiders together and attach them to the ceiling. Besides, Petya knows that the lower the spiders will hang, the more mum is going to like it and then she won't throw his favourite toys away. Help Petya carry out the plan.\n\nA spider consists of *k* beads tied together by *k*<=-<=1 threads. Each thread connects two different beads, at that any pair of beads that make up a spider is either directly connected by a thread, or is connected via some chain of threads and beads.\n\nPetya may glue spiders together directly gluing their beads. The length of each thread equals 1. The sizes of the beads can be neglected. That's why we can consider that gluing spiders happens by identifying some of the beads (see the picture). Besides, the construction resulting from the gluing process should also represent a spider, that is, it should have the given features. \n\nAfter Petya glues all spiders together, he measures the length of the resulting toy. The distance between a pair of beads is identified as the total length of the threads that connect these two beads. The length of the resulting construction is the largest distance between all pairs of beads. Petya wants to make the spider whose length is as much as possible.\n\nThe picture two shows two spiders from the second sample.

As a result, the Kingdom healers had already had three appointments with the merchants who were asked to sell, say, exactly 0.273549107 beer barrels. To deal with the problem somehow, the King issued an order obliging rounding up all numbers to the closest integer to simplify calculations. Specifically, the order went like this:\n-  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is strictly less than 0.5, then the rounded up number coincides with the number\u2019s integer part. -  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is not less than 0.5, the rounded up number is obtained if we add 1 to the last digit of the number\u2019s integer part.-  If the number\u2019s integer part ends with digit 9, to round up the numbers one should go to Vasilisa the Wise. In the whole Kingdom she is the only one who can perform the tricky operation of carrying into the next position. \nMerchants found the algorithm very sophisticated and they asked you (the ACMers) to help them.

In particular, if *t**i*<=\u2265<=*d**i*, then *i*-th item cannot be saved.\n\nGiven the values *p**i* for each of the items, find a set of items that Polycarp can save such that the total value of this items is maximum possible. Polycarp saves the items one after another. For example, if he takes item *a* first, and then item *b*, then the item *a* will be saved in *t**a* seconds, and the item *b* \u2014 in *t**a*<=+<=*t**b* seconds after fire started.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of items in Polycarp's house.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains three integers *t**i*,<=*d**i*,<=*p**i* (1<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=20, 1<=\u2264<=*d**i*<=\u2264<=2<=000, 1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=20) \u2014 the time needed to save the item *i*, the time after which the item *i* will burn completely and the value of item *i*.. Output specification: In the first line print the maximum possible total value of the set of saved items. In the second line print one integer *m* \u2014 the number of items in the desired set. In the third line print *m* distinct integers \u2014 numbers of the saved items in the order Polycarp saves them. Items are 1-indexed in the same order in which they appear in the input. If there are several answers, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['3\\n3 7 4\\n2 6 5\\n3 7 6\\n', '2\\n5 6 1\\n3 3 5\\n'], Demo output: ['11\\n2\\n2 3 \\n', '1\\n1\\n1 \\n']\nNote: In the first example Polycarp will have time to save any two items, but in order to maximize the total value of the saved items, he must save the second and the third item. For example, he can firstly save the third item in 3 seconds, and then save the second item in another 2 seconds. Thus, the total value of the saved items will be 6\u2009+\u20095\u2009=\u200911.\n\nIn the second example Polycarp can save only the first item, since even if he immediately starts saving the second item, he can save it in 3 seconds, but this item will already be completely burned by this time."}]}}

One of these tasks is the following.\n\nA sequence of *l* integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**l* (1<=\u2264<=*b*1<=\u2264<=*b*2<=\u2264<=...<=\u2264<=*b**l*<=\u2264<=*n*) is called good if each number divides (without a remainder) by the next number in the sequence. More formally  for all *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*l*<=-<=1).\n\nGiven *n* and *k* find the number of good sequences of length *k*. As the answer can be rather large print it modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\nInput specification: The first line of input contains two space-separated integers *n*,<=*k*\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=2000).. Output specification: Output a single integer \u2014 the number of good sequences of length *k* modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\nDemo input: ['3 2\\n', '6 4\\n', '2 1\\n'], Demo output: ['5\\n', '39\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: In the first sample the good sequences are: [1,\u20091],\u2009[2,\u20092],\u2009[3,\u20093],\u2009[1,\u20092],\u2009[1,\u20093]."}]}}

This game needs a huge space, so they play it with a computer.\n\nIn this game there are *n* objects numbered from 1 to *n* arranged in a circle (in clockwise order). Object number 1 is a black hole and the others are planets. There's a monster in one of the planet. Rick and Morty don't know on which one yet, only that he's not initially in the black hole, but Unity will inform them before the game starts. But for now, they want to be prepared for every possible scenario.\n\nEach one of them has a set of numbers between 1 and *n*<=-<=1 (inclusive). Rick's set is *s*1 with *k*1 elements and Morty's is *s*2 with *k*2 elements. One of them goes first and the player changes alternatively. In each player's turn, he should choose an arbitrary number like *x* from his set and the monster will move to his *x*-th next object from its current position (clockwise). If after his move the monster gets to the black hole he wins.\n\nYour task is that for each of monster's initial positions and who plays first determine if the starter wins, loses, or the game will stuck in an infinite loop.

Write a python script for the following problem: Oleg writes down the history of the days he lived. For each day he decides if it was good or bad. Oleg calls a non-empty sequence of days a zebra, if it starts with a bad day, ends with a bad day, and good and bad days are alternating in it. Let us denote bad days as 0 and good days as 1. Then, for example, sequences of days 0, 010, 01010 are zebras, while sequences 1, 0110, 0101 are not.\n\nOleg tells you the story of days he lived in chronological order in form of string consisting of 0 and 1. Now you are interested if it is possible to divide Oleg's life history into several subsequences, each of which is a zebra, and the way it can be done. Each day must belong to exactly one of the subsequences. For each of the subsequences, days forming it must be ordered chronologically. Note that subsequence does not have to be a group of consecutive days.\nInput specification: In the only line of input data there is a non-empty string *s* consisting of characters 0 and 1, which describes the history of Oleg's life.

At this stage Vasya's ninja should get out of a deep canyon.\n\nThe canyon consists of two vertical parallel walls, their height is *n* meters.

He can use each second to perform one of the following actions: \n -  climb one area up; -  climb one area down; -  jump to the opposite wall. That gets the ninja to the area that is exactly *k* meters higher than the area he jumped from.

Besides, the keys are of two types. Some of the keys have lowercase Latin letters on them and some of the keys work like the \"Shift\" key on standard keyboards, that is, they make lowercase letters uppercase.\n\nVasya can press one or two keys with one hand. However, he can only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the keys does not exceed *x*. The keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.\n\nVasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest \"Shift\" key is strictly larger than *x*. In this case he will have to use his other hand. Having typed the symbol, Vasya returns other hand back to the chips.\n\nYou are given Vasya's keyboard and the text. Count the minimum number of times Vasya will have to use the other hand.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *x* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=30,<=1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=50).\n\nNext *n* lines contain descriptions of all the keyboard keys.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.\n\nThere are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.\n\nOfficer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:\n -  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$; -  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. \nFor example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\n\nThe structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.\n\nFormally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.\n\nBerland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.\n\nSuppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ \u2014 one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.\n\nLet's look at the following example:\n\nIf officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.\n\nIf officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.\n\nTo answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.\n\nYou should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i &lt; i$), where $p_i$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $i$. The commander has index $1$ and doesn't have any superiors.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query is given as a pair ($u_i, k_i$) ($1 \\le u_i, k_i \\le n$), where $u_i$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $k_i$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence.. Output specification: Print $q$ numbers, where the $i$-th number is the officer at the position $k_i$ in the list which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if it starts spreading from officer $u_i$. Print \"-1\" if the number of officers which receive the command is less than $k_i$.\n\nYou should process queries independently. They do not affect each other.\nDemo input: ['9 6\\n1 1 1 3 5 3 5 7\\n3 1\\n1 5\\n3 4\\n7 3\\n1 8\\n1 9\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n6\\n8\\n-1\\n9\\n4\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

You want to merge them into one deck in which each card is face down. You're going to do it in two stages.\n\nThe first stage is to merge the two decks in such a way that the relative order of the cards from the same deck doesn't change. That is, for any two different cards *i* and *j* in one deck, if card *i* lies above card *j*, then after the merge card *i* must also be above card *j*.\n\nThe second stage is performed on the deck that resulted from the first stage. At this stage, the executed operation is the turning operation. In one turn you can take a few of the top cards, turn all of them, and put them back. Thus, each of the taken cards gets turned and the order of these cards is reversed. That is, the card that was on the bottom before the turn, will be on top after it.\n\nYour task is to make sure that all the cards are lying face down.

The problem statement is:\n\nGiven an undirected tree consisting of *n* nodes, find the minimum number of vertices that cover all the edges. Formally, we need to find a set of vertices such that for each edge (*u*,<=*v*) that belongs to the tree, either *u* is in the set, or *v* is in the set, or both are in the set. Mahmoud has found the following algorithm:\n -  Root the tree at node 1. -  Count the number of nodes at an even depth. Let it be *evenCnt*. -  Count the number of nodes at an odd depth. Let it be *oddCnt*. -  The answer is the minimum between *evenCnt* and *oddCnt*. \nThe depth of a node in a tree is the number of edges in the shortest path between this node and the root. The depth of the root is 0.\n\nEhab told Mahmoud that this algorithm is wrong, but he didn't believe because he had tested his algorithm against many trees and it worked, so Ehab asked you to find 2 trees consisting of *n* nodes.

Wanting to join the craze, she has immediately bought the strange contraption.\n\nSpinners in Sweetland have the form of V-shaped pieces of caramel. Each spinner can, well, spin around an invisible magic axis. At a specific point in time, a spinner can take 4 positions shown below (each one rotated 90 degrees relative to the previous, with the fourth one followed by the first one):\n\nAfter the spinner was spun, it starts its rotation, which is described by a following algorithm: the spinner maintains its position for a second then majestically switches to the next position in clockwise or counter-clockwise order, depending on the direction the spinner was spun in.\n\nSlastyona managed to have spinner rotating for exactly *n* seconds. Being fascinated by elegance of the process, she completely forgot the direction the spinner was spun in! Lucky for her, she managed to recall the starting position, and wants to deduct the direction given the information she knows. Help her do this.\nInput specification: There are two characters in the first string\u00a0\u2013 the starting and the ending position of a spinner. The position is encoded with one of the following characters: v (ASCII code 118, lowercase v), &lt; (ASCII code 60), ^ (ASCII code 94) or &gt; (ASCII code 62) (see the picture above for reference).

Write a python script for the following problem: Doubly linked list is one of the fundamental data structures. A doubly linked list is a sequence of elements, each containing information about the previous and the next elements of the list. In this problem all lists have linear structure. I.e. each element except the first has exactly one previous element, each element except the last has exactly one next element. The list is not closed in a cycle.\n\nIn this problem you are given *n* memory cells forming one or more doubly linked lists. Each cell contains information about element from some list. Memory cells are numbered from 1 to *n*.\n\nFor each cell *i* you are given two values: \n -  *l**i* \u2014 cell containing previous element for the element in the cell *i*; -  *r**i* \u2014 cell containing next element for the element in the cell *i*. \nIf cell *i* contains information about the element which has no previous element then *l**i*<==<=0. Similarly, if cell *i* contains information about the element which has no next element then *r**i*<==<=0.\n\nFor example, for the picture above the values of *l* and *r* are the following: *l*1<==<=4, *r*1<==<=7; *l*2<==<=5, *r*2<==<=0; *l*3<==<=0, *r*3<==<=0; *l*4<==<=6, *r*4<==<=1; *l*5<==<=0, *r*5<==<=2; *l*6<==<=0, *r*6<==<=4; *l*7<==<=1, *r*7<==<=0.\n\nYour task is to unite all given lists in a single list, joining them to each other in any order. In particular, if the input data already contains a single list, then there is no need to perform any actions. Print the resulting list in the form of values *l**i*, *r**i*.\n\nAny other action, other than joining the beginning of one list to the end of another, can not be performed.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of memory cells where the doubly linked lists are located.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains two integers *l**i*, *r**i* (0<=\u2264<=*l**i*,<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the cells of the previous and the next element of list for cell *i*. Value *l**i*<==<=0 if element in cell *i* has no previous element in its list. Value *r**i*<==<=0 if element in cell *i* has no next element in its list.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the input contains the correct description of a single or more doubly linked lists. All lists have linear structure: each element of list except the first has exactly one previous element; each element of list except the last has exactly one next element. Each memory cell contains information about one element from some list, each element of each list written in one of *n* given cells.. Output specification: Print *n* lines, the *i*-th line must contain two integers *l**i* and *r**i* \u2014 the cells of the previous and the next element of list for cell *i* after all lists from the input are united in a single list.

Recently, Valya took offense at her boyfriend because he came to her in t-shirt with lettering that differs from lettering on her pullover. Now she doesn't want to see him and Tolya is seating at his room and crying at her photos all day long.\n\nThis story could be very sad but fairy godmother (Tolya's grandmother) decided to help them and restore their relationship.

Using one unit of mana, grandmother can buy a spell of form (*c*1,<=*c*2) (where *c*1 and *c*2 are some lowercase English letters), which can arbitrary number of times transform a single letter *c*1 to *c*2 and vise-versa on both Tolya's t-shirt and Valya's pullover.

Write a python script for the following problem: Let's define the permutation of length *n* as an array *p*<==<=[*p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n*] consisting of *n* distinct integers from range from 1 to *n*. We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value *p*1, value 2 into the value *p*2 and so on.\n\nKyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a permutation. A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle). The cyclic representation is a representation of *p* as a collection of cycles forming *p*. For example, permutation *p*<==<=[4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] has a cyclic representation that looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are swapped, and 5 remains in place. \n\nPermutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya defines the standard cyclic representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first. Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation of [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] is (421)(5)(63).\n\nNow, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For instance, [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] will become [4,<=2,<=1,<=5,<=6,<=3].\n\nKyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of length *n* that do not change in a list in lexicographic order. Unfortunately, his friend Tamaki Suoh lost this list. Kyoya wishes to reproduce the list and he needs your help. Given the integers *n* and *k*, print the permutation that was *k*-th on Kyoya's list.\nInput specification: The first line will contain two integers *n*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*min*{1018,<=*l*} where *l* is the length of the Kyoya's list).. Output specification: Print *n* space-separated integers, representing the permutation that is the answer for the question.\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n', '10 1\\n'], Demo output: ['1 3 2 4\\n', '1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\\n']\nNote: The standard cycle representation is (1)(32)(4), which after removing parenthesis gives us the original permutation. The first permutation on the list would be [1,\u20092,\u20093,\u20094], while the second permutation would be [1,\u20092,\u20094,\u20093]."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.\n\nThere are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.\n\nOfficer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:\n -  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$; -  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. \nFor example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\n\nThe structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.\n\nFormally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.\n\nBerland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.\n\nSuppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ \u2014 one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.\n\nLet's look at the following example:\n\nIf officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.\n\nIf officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.\n\nTo answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.\n\nYou should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i &lt; i$), where $p_i$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $i$. The commander has index $1$ and doesn't have any superiors.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query is given as a pair ($u_i, k_i$) ($1 \\le u_i, k_i \\le n$), where $u_i$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $k_i$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence.. Output specification: Print $q$ numbers, where the $i$-th number is the officer at the position $k_i$ in the list which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if it starts spreading from officer $u_i$. Print \"-1\" if the number of officers which receive the command is less than $k_i$.\n\nYou should process queries independently. They do not affect each other.\nDemo input: ['9 6\\n1 1 1 3 5 3 5 7\\n3 1\\n1 5\\n3 4\\n7 3\\n1 8\\n1 9\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n6\\n8\\n-1\\n9\\n4\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis.

Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24.

Write a python script for the following problem: Felix the Robot is preparing for a probability theory exam. Unfortunately, during the semester, he took a course of the belles-lettres instead of studying the subject, so now he does not know the answer to any of the upcoming exam's questions. One thing is for sure: Felix needs help!\n\nThe exam for robots is an online event. It consists of *n*<==<=5000 questions each of which has only two possible answers: \"yes\" and \"no\". A robot can attempt to pass the exam at most *x*<==<=100 times. The questions, their order and right answers don't change from one attempt to another. Once the exam starts, Felix will get just a few seconds for all his attempts, and he can't learn the right answers so fast.\n\nThe robot will try to pass the exam in the following way. First, Felix fixes the answers for all questions. The result is a string of *n* bits: answers for the first, second, ..., *n*-th questions. In this string, 0 means that the answer is \"no\", and 1 is for \"yes\". Then he answers the questions according to this string, spending one attempt. After that, Felix can fix another string of *n* bits and make another attempt, and so on until there are no more attempts.\n\nIn the online system for exam, the following optimization is implemented: if at some moment of time, the examinee already got *k*<==<=2000 answers wrong, the attempt is immediately terminated with the corresponding message. For Felix, this means that the remaining bits in the string he fixed are ignored. If there were strictly less than *k* wrong answers for all *n* questions, the exam is considered passed.\n\nThe result of an attempt is a number from *k* to *n* inclusive: the number of questions after which the attempt was terminated. If the exam is passed, this number is considered to be *n*<=+<=1. The exam result is the highest result among all attempts. If there were no attempts, the exam result is zero.\n\nYour task is to write a program which will determine the bit strings for all attempts Felix makes. After each attempt, your program will get its result immediately. Help Felix get the highest exam result you can!\n\nInteraction Protocol\n\nYour solution can make from 0 to *x* attempts inclusive. To make an attempt, print a string to the standard output. The string must consist of exactly *n* binary digits without spaces and end with a newline character.\n\nTo prevent output buffering, after printing a string, insert a command to flush the buffer: for example, it can be fflush\u00a0(stdout) in C or C++, System.out.flush\u00a0() in Java, flush\u00a0(output) in Pascal or sys.stdout.flush\u00a0() in Python.\n\nAfter each attempt you make, you can immediately read its result from the standard input. The result is an integer from *k* to *n*<=+<=1 inclusive, followed by a newline character.\n\nScoring System\n\nA test is defined by a string of *n* binary digits: the right answers to *n* questions. This string is kept secret from the solution. Each test is evaluated separately.\n\nIf a solution followed the interaction protocol and terminated correctly on a test, it gets a score of *max* (0,<=*S*<=-<=4000) where *S* is the exam result. Otherwise, the solution gets zero score for the test.\n\nTesting\n\nYour solution will be checked on sets of tests generated in advance. Each test is created using a pseudo-random number generator. You can consider that the answers are uniformly distributed (the probabilities of digits 0 and 1 are the same) and mutually independent (the probabilities of all 2*n* possible strings are the same). A solution gets the score which is the sum of its score on all the tests.\n\nDuring the main phase of the contest, there are two ways to send a solution for checking.\n -  The first one is to check on examples. There are 10 example tests which are also available for local testing. As soon as the solution is checked, you can see reports for all examples by clicking on the submission result.-  The second way is to check on preliminary tests. There are 100 preliminary tests which are generated in advance but kept secret. The score for preliminary tests (but not for example tests) is used in the preliminary scoreboard. This score does not affect the final results, but nevertheless allows to roughly compare a solution with others. \nAfter the main phase ends, for each participant, the system chooses the final solution:\n -  consider all solutions sent for preliminary testing; -  choose the ones which got a total score strictly greater than zero; -  define the final solution as the one of chosen solutions which has the latest submission time. \nNote that the solutions sent only to be checked on examples are not considered when choosing the final solution.\n\nDuring the final testing, all final solutions will be checked on the same large set of a large number (<=\u2248<=1000) of final tests. The score for final tests determines the final scoreboard. The winner is the contestant whose solution gets the highest total score. In case two or more participants have equal total score, the contestants with such score tie for the same place.\n\nA package for local development is available on GitHub at the following address: [https://github.com/GassaFM/online-exam](https://github.com/GassaFM/online-exam). You can download sources or the latest release: [https://github.com/GassaFM/online-exam/releases](https://github.com/GassaFM/online-exam/releases).\n\nExample\n\nTo have an example which fits into the problem statement, let *n*<==<=10, *k*<==<=2, and *x*<==<=3 (recall that in the real problem, *n*<==<=5000, *k*<==<=2000, and *x*<==<=100, so this example is not a correct test for the problem). Let the right answers be defined by the string 1010001111. Before any attempts are made, the exam result is zero.\n\nConsider a solution making three attempts.\n\nLet the first attempt be defined by the string 0100100100. The result of this attempt is the number 2: the first wrong answer is the answer to the first question, and the second is to the second question. The exam result at this moment is 2.\n\nLet the second attempt be defined by the string 1010101010. The result of this attempt is the number 8: the first wrong answer is the answer to the fifth question, and the second is to the eighth question. The exam result at this moment is 8.\n\nLet the second attempt be defined by the string 1001011001. The result of this attempt is the number 4: the first wrong answer is the answer to the third question, and the second is to the fourth question. The exam result at this moment is still 8.\n\nAs *x*<==<=3 in our example, further attempts are impossible, so if the solution terminates correctly, the exam result is 8.\n\nNow consider another solution making two attempts.\n\nLet the first attempt be defined by the string 1010001110. Its result is the number 11: the first and only wrong answer is the answer to the tenth question, *k*<==<=2, so the exam is considered passed.\n\nLet the first attempt be defined by the string 0000011111. Its result is the number 3: the first wrong answer is the answer to the first question, and the second one is to the third question.\n\nIf the solution terminates correctly after the above two attempts, the exam result is 11.\nInput specification: none.

Formally: \n -  There is no road between *a* and *b*. -  There exists a sequence (path) of *n* distinct cities *v*1,<=*v*2,<=...,<=*v**n* that *v*1<==<=*a*, *v**n*<==<=*b* and there is a road between *v**i* and *v**i*<=+<=1 for . \nOn the other day, the similar thing happened. Limak wanted to travel between a city *c* and a city *d*. There is no road between them but there exists a sequence of *n* distinct cities *u*1,<=*u*2,<=...,<=*u**n* that *u*1<==<=*c*, *u**n*<==<=*d* and there is a road between *u**i* and *u**i*<=+<=1 for .\n\nAlso, Limak thinks that there are at most *k* roads in Bearland. He wonders whether he remembers everything correctly.\n\nGiven *n*, *k* and four distinct cities *a*, *b*, *c*, *d*, can you find possible paths (*v*1,<=...,<=*v**n*) and (*u*1,<=...,<=*u**n*) to satisfy all the given conditions? Find any solution or print -1 if it's impossible.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *k* (4<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000, *n*<=-<=1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=2*n*<=-<=2)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cities and the maximum allowed number of roads, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains four distinct integers *a*, *b*, *c* and *d* (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*,<=*c*,<=*d*<=\u2264<=*n*).. Output specification: Print -1 if it's impossible to satisfy all the given conditions. Otherwise, print two lines with paths descriptions. The first of these two lines should contain *n* distinct integers *v*1,<=*v*2,<=...,<=*v**n* where *v*1<==<=*a* and *v**n*<==<=*b*. The second line should contain *n* distinct integers *u*1,<=*u*2,<=...,<=*u**n* where *u*1<==<=*c* and *u**n*<==<=*d*.\n\nTwo paths generate at most 2*n*<=-<=2 roads: (*v*1,<=*v*2),<=(*v*2,<=*v*3),<=...,<=(*v**n*<=-<=1,<=*v**n*),<=(*u*1,<=*u*2),<=(*u*2,<=*u*3),<=...,<=(*u**n*<=-<=1,<=*u**n*). Your answer will be considered wrong if contains more than *k* distinct roads or any other condition breaks. Note that (*x*,<=*y*) and (*y*,<=*x*) are the same road.\nDemo input: ['7 11\\n2 4 7 3\\n', '1000 999\\n10 20 30 40\\n'], Demo output: ['2 7 1 3 6 5 4\\n7 1 5 4 6 2 3\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: In the first sample test, there should be 7 cities and at most 11 roads. The provided sample solution generates 10 roads, as in the drawing. You can also see a simple path of length *n* between 2 and 4, and a path between 7 and 3."}]}}

He left a calculator on the floor and went to ask some money from his parents. Meanwhile his little brother Yusuf came and started to press the keys randomly. Unfortunately Max has forgotten the number which he had calculated. The only thing he knows is that the number is divisible by 4.\n\nYou are given a string *s* consisting of digits (the number on the display of the calculator after Yusuf randomly pressed the keys). Your task is to find the number of substrings which are divisible by 4. A substring can start with a zero.\n\nA substring of a string is a nonempty sequence of consecutive characters.\n\nFor example if string *s* is 124 then we have four substrings that are divisible by 4: 12, 4, 24 and 124. For the string 04 the answer is three: 0, 4, 04.\n\nAs input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use gets/scanf/printf instead of getline/cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java.\nInput specification: The only line contains string *s* (1<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105).

Initially the children stood in the order they entered the canteen. However, after a while the boys started feeling awkward for standing in front of the girls in the queue and they started letting the girls move forward each second. \n\nLet's describe the process more precisely. Let's say that the positions in the queue are sequentially numbered by integers from 1 to *n*, at that the person in the position number 1 is served first. Then, if at time *x* a boy stands on the *i*-th position and a girl stands on the (*i*<=+<=1)-th position, then at time *x*<=+<=1 the *i*-th position will have a girl and the (*i*<=+<=1)-th position will have a boy.

However, she has to get an \u00abA\u00bb graduation certificate in order to apply to a prestigious one.\n\nIn school, where Noora is studying, teachers are putting down marks to the online class register, which are integers from 1 to *k*. The worst mark is 1, the best is *k*. Mark that is going to the certificate, is calculated as an average of all the marks, rounded to the closest integer. If several answers are possible, rounding up is produced. For example, 7.3 is rounded to 7, but 7.5 and 7.8784\u00a0\u2014 to 8. \n\nFor instance, if Noora has marks [8,<=9], then the mark to the certificate is 9, because the average is equal to 8.5 and rounded to 9, but if the marks are [8,<=8,<=9], Noora will have graduation certificate with 8.\n\nTo graduate with \u00abA\u00bb certificate, Noora has to have mark *k*.\n\nNoora got *n* marks in register this year. However, she is afraid that her marks are not enough to get final mark *k*. Noora decided to ask for help in the internet, where hacker Leha immediately responded to her request. He is ready to hack class register for Noora and to add Noora any number of additional marks from 1 to *k*. At the same time, Leha want his hack be unseen to everyone, so he decided to add as less as possible additional marks.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: A Large Software Company develops its own social network. Analysts have found that during the holidays, major sporting events and other significant events users begin to enter the network more frequently, resulting in great load increase on the infrastructure.\n\nAs part of this task, we assume that the social network is 4*n* processes running on the *n* servers. All servers are absolutely identical machines, each of which has a volume of RAM of 1 GB = 1024 MB (1). Each process takes 100 MB of RAM on the server. At the same time, the needs of maintaining the viability of the server takes about 100 more megabytes of RAM. Thus, each server may have up to 9 different processes of social network.\n\nNow each of the *n* servers is running exactly 4 processes. However, at the moment of peak load it is sometimes necessary to replicate the existing 4*n* processes by creating 8*n* new processes instead of the old ones. More formally, there is a set of replication rules, the *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=4*n*) of which has the form of *a**i*<=\u2192<=(*b**i*,<=*c**i*), where *a**i*, *b**i* and *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*,<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) are the numbers of servers. This means that instead of an old process running on server *a**i*, there should appear two new copies of the process running on servers *b**i* and *c**i*. The two new replicated processes can be on the same server (i.e., *b**i* may be equal to *c**i*) or even on the same server where the original process was (i.e. *a**i* may be equal to *b**i* or *c**i*). During the implementation of the rule *a**i*<=\u2192<=(*b**i*,<=*c**i*) first the process from the server *a**i* is destroyed, then appears a process on the server *b**i*, then appears a process on the server *c**i*.\n\nThere is a set of 4*n* rules, destroying all the original 4*n* processes from *n* servers, and creating after their application 8*n* replicated processes, besides, on each of the *n* servers will be exactly 8 processes. However, the rules can only be applied consecutively, and therefore the amount of RAM of the servers imposes limitations on the procedure for the application of the rules.\n\nAccording to this set of rules determine the order in which you want to apply all the 4*n* rules so that at any given time the memory of each of the servers contained at most 9 processes (old and new together), or tell that it is impossible.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=30<=000) \u2014 the number of servers of the social network.\n\nNext 4*n* lines contain the rules of replicating processes, the *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=4*n*) of these lines as form *a**i*,<=*b**i*,<=*c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*,<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) and describes rule *a**i*<=\u2192<=(*b**i*,<=*c**i*).\n\nIt is guaranteed that each number of a server from 1 to *n* occurs four times in the set of all *a**i*, and eight times among a set that unites all *b**i* and *c**i*.. Output specification: If the required order of performing rules does not exist, print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\nOtherwise, print in the first line \"YES\" (without the quotes), and in the second line \u2014 a sequence of 4*n* numbers from 1 to 4*n*, giving the numbers of the rules in the order they are applied. The sequence should be a permutation, that is, include each number from 1 to 4*n* exactly once.\n\nIf there are multiple possible variants, you are allowed to print any of them.\nDemo input: ['2\\n1 2 2\\n1 2 2\\n1 2 2\\n1 2 2\\n2 1 1\\n2 1 1\\n2 1 1\\n2 1 1\\n', '3\\n1 2 3\\n1 1 1\\n1 1 1\\n1 1 1\\n2 1 3\\n2 2 2\\n2 2 2\\n2 2 2\\n3 1 2\\n3 3 3\\n3 3 3\\n3 3 3\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n1 2 5 6 3 7 4 8\\n', 'YES\\n2 3 4 6 7 8 10 11 12 1 5 9\\n']\nNote: <sup class=\"upper-index\">(1)</sup> To be extremely accurate, we should note that the amount of server memory is 1 GiB = 1024 MiB and processes require 100 MiB RAM where a gibibyte (GiB) is the amount of RAM of 2<sup class=\"upper-index\">30</sup> bytes and a mebibyte (MiB) is the amount of RAM of 2<sup class=\"upper-index\">20</sup> bytes.\n\nIn the first sample test the network uses two servers, each of which initially has four launched processes. In accordance with the rules of replication, each of the processes must be destroyed and twice run on another server. One of the possible answers is given in the statement: after applying rules 1 and 2 the first server will have 2 old running processes, and the second server will have 8 (4 old and 4 new) processes. After we apply rules 5 and 6, both servers will have 6 running processes (2 old and 4 new). After we apply rules 3 and 7, both servers will have 7 running processes (1 old and 6 new), and after we apply rules 4 and 8, each server will have 8 running processes. At no time the number of processes on a single server exceeds 9.\n\nIn the second sample test the network uses three servers. On each server, three processes are replicated into two processes on the same server, and the fourth one is replicated in one process for each of the two remaining servers. As a result of applying rules 2,\u20093,\u20094,\u20096,\u20097,\u20098,\u200910,\u200911,\u200912 each server would have 7 processes (6 old and 1 new), as a result of applying rules 1,\u20095,\u20099 each server will have 8 processes. At no time the number of processes on a single server exceeds 9."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: A schoolboy named Vasya loves reading books on programming and mathematics. He has recently read an encyclopedia article that described the method of median smoothing (or median filter) and its many applications in science and engineering. Vasya liked the idea of the method very much, and he decided to try it in practice.\n\nApplying the simplest variant of median smoothing to the sequence of numbers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* will result a new sequence *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**n* obtained by the following algorithm:\n -  *b*1<==<=*a*1, *b**n*<==<=*a**n*, that is, the first and the last number of the new sequence match the corresponding numbers of the original sequence. -  For *i*<==<=2,<=...,<=*n*<=-<=1 value *b**i* is equal to the median of three values *a**i*<=-<=1, *a**i* and *a**i*<=+<=1. \nThe median of a set of three numbers is the number that goes on the second place, when these three numbers are written in the non-decreasing order. For example, the median of the set 5, 1, 2 is number 2, and the median of set 1, 0, 1 is equal to 1.\n\nIn order to make the task easier, Vasya decided to apply the method to sequences consisting of zeros and ones only.\n\nHaving made the procedure once, Vasya looked at the resulting sequence and thought: what if I apply the algorithm to it once again, and then apply it to the next result, and so on? Vasya tried a couple of examples and found out that after some number of median smoothing algorithm applications the sequence can stop changing. We say that the sequence is stable, if it does not change when the median smoothing is applied to it.\n\nNow Vasya wonders, whether the sequence always eventually becomes stable. He asks you to write a program that, given a sequence of zeros and ones, will determine whether it ever becomes stable. Moreover, if it ever becomes stable, then you should determine what will it look like and how many times one needs to apply the median smoothing algorithm to initial sequence in order to obtain a stable one.\nInput specification: The first input line of the input contains a single integer *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=500<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the initial sequence.\n\nThe next line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (*a**i*<==<=0 or *a**i*<==<=1), giving the initial sequence itself.. Output specification: If the sequence will never become stable, print a single number <=-<=1.\n\nOtherwise, first print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of times one needs to apply the median smoothing algorithm to the initial sequence before it becomes is stable.

Okabe wants Daru to throw away the boxes in the order from 1 to *n*. Of course, this means that it might be impossible for Daru to perform some of Okabe's remove commands, because the required box is not on the top of the stack.\n\nThat's why Daru can decide to wait until Okabe looks away and then reorder the boxes in the stack in any way he wants. He can do it at any point of time between Okabe's commands, but he can't add or remove boxes while he does it.\n\nTell Daru the minimum number of times he needs to reorder the boxes so that he can successfully complete all of Okabe's commands.

Write a python script for the following problem: There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: \n -  alloc n \u2014 to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; \nThe memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.\n\nThe first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.\nInput specification: The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100;1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *t* \u2014 the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* \u2014 the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.. Output specification: Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession. Output lines should go in the same order in which the operations are processed.

Empty cells are marked with '.', impassable cells are marked with '*'. Let's call two empty cells adjacent if they share a side.\n\nLet's call a connected component any non-extendible set of cells such that any two of them are connected by the path of adjacent cells.

Write a python script for the following problem: After the big birthday party, Katie still wanted Shiro to have some more fun. Later, she came up with a game called treasure hunt. Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.\n\nThe three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.\n\nA random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of $7$ because its subribbon a appears $7$ times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of $2$ because its subribbon abc appears twice.\n\nThe rules are simple. The game will have $n$ turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $n$ turns wins the treasure.\n\nCould you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of turns.\n\nNext 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors.. Output specification: Print the name of the winner (\"Kuro\", \"Shiro\" or \"Katie\"). If there are at least two cats that share the maximum beauty, print \"Draw\".\nDemo input: ['3\\nKuroo\\nShiro\\nKatie\\n', '7\\ntreasurehunt\\nthreefriends\\nhiCodeforces\\n', '1\\nabcabc\\ncbabac\\nababca\\n', '15\\nfoPaErcvJ\\nmZaxowpbt\\nmkuOlaHRE\\n'], Demo output: ['Kuro\\n', 'Shiro\\n', 'Katie\\n', 'Draw\\n']\nNote: In the first example, after $3$ turns, Kuro can change his ribbon into ooooo, which has the beauty of $5$, while reaching such beauty for Shiro and Katie is impossible (both Shiro and Katie can reach the beauty of at most $4$, for example by changing Shiro's ribbon into SSiSS and changing Katie's ribbon into Kaaaa). Therefore, the winner is Kuro.\n\nIn the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice.

A bus is a connected graph that is the only path, that is, the graph where all nodes are connected with two other ones except for some two nodes that are the beginning and the end of the path. A ring is a connected graph, where all nodes are connected with two other ones. A star is a connected graph, where a single central node is singled out and connected with all other nodes.

In other words, *h* was the biggest distance between vertex 1 and some other vertex. \nThe distance between two vertices of the tree is the number of edges on the simple path between them.\n\nHelp Limak to restore his tree. Check whether there exists a tree satisfying the given conditions. Find any such tree and print its edges in any order. It's also possible that Limak made a mistake and there is no suitable tree\u00a0\u2013 in this case print \"-1\".\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *d* and *h* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000,<=1<=\u2264<=*h*<=\u2264<=*d*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices, diameter, and height after rooting in vertex 1, respectively.. Output specification: If there is no tree matching what Limak remembers, print the only line with \"-1\" (without the quotes).\n\nOtherwise, describe any tree matching Limak's description. Print *n*<=-<=1 lines, each with two space-separated integers\u00a0\u2013 indices of vertices connected by an edge. If there are many valid trees, print any of them. You can print edges in any order.\nDemo input: ['5 3 2\\n', '8 5 2\\n', '8 4 2\\n'], Demo output: ['1 2\\n1 3\\n3 4\\n3 5', '-1\\n', '4 8\\n5 7\\n2 3\\n8 1\\n2 1\\n5 6\\n1 5\\n']\nNote: Below you can see trees printed to the output in the first sample and the third sample."}]}}
