Write a python script for the following problem: Many students live in a dormitory. A dormitory is a whole new world of funny amusements and possibilities but it does have its drawbacks. \n\nThere is only one shower and there are multiple students who wish to have a shower in the morning. That's why every morning there is a line of five people in front of the dormitory shower door. As soon as the shower opens, the first person from the line enters the shower. After a while the first person leaves the shower and the next person enters the shower. The process continues until everybody in the line has a shower.\n\nHaving a shower takes some time, so the students in the line talk as they wait. At each moment of time the students talk in pairs: the (2*i*<=-<=1)-th man in the line (for the current moment) talks with the (2*i*)-th one. \n\nLet's look at this process in more detail. Let's number the people from 1 to 5. Let's assume that the line initially looks as 23154 (person number 2 stands at the beginning of the line). Then, before the shower opens, 2 talks with 3, 1 talks with 5, 4 doesn't talk with anyone. Then 2 enters the shower. While 2 has a shower, 3 and 1 talk, 5 and 4 talk too. Then, 3 enters the shower.

Write a python script for the following problem: Nowadays, most of the internet advertisements are not statically linked to a web page. Instead, what will be shown to the person opening a web page is determined within 100 milliseconds after the web page is opened. Usually, multiple companies compete for each ad slot on the web page in an auction. Each of them receives a request with details about the user, web page and ad slot and they have to respond within those 100 milliseconds with a bid they would pay for putting an advertisement on that ad slot. The company that suggests the highest bid wins the auction and gets to place its advertisement. If there are several companies tied for the highest bid, the winner gets picked at random.\n\nHowever, the company that won the auction does not have to pay the exact amount of its bid. In most of the cases, a second-price auction is used. This means that the amount paid by the company is equal to the maximum of all the other bids placed for this ad slot.\n\nLet's consider one such bidding. There are *n* companies competing for placing an ad. The *i*-th of these companies will bid an integer number of microdollars equiprobably randomly chosen from the range between *L**i* and *R**i*, inclusive. In the other words, the value of the *i*-th company bid can be any integer from the range [*L**i*,<=*R**i*] with the same probability. \n\nDetermine the expected value that the winner will have to pay in a second-price auction.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains an integer number *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=5). *n* lines follow, the *i*-th of them containing two numbers *L**i* and *R**i* (1<=\u2264<=*L**i*<=\u2264<=*R**i*<=\u2264<=10000) describing the *i*-th company's bid preferences.\n\nThis problem doesn't have subproblems.

The first company bids a random integer number of microdollars in range [4,\u20097]; the second company bids between 8 and 10, and the third company bids 5 microdollars. The second company will win regardless of the exact value it bids, however the price it will pay depends on the value of first company's bid.

You can find more formal definitions of a tree and a bipartite graph in the notes section below.\n\nDr. Evil gave Mahmoud and Ehab a tree consisting of *n* nodes and asked them to add edges to it in such a way, that the graph is still bipartite. Besides, after adding these edges the graph should be simple (doesn't contain loops or multiple edges). What is the maximum number of edges they can add?\n\nA loop is an edge, which connects a node with itself.

Write a python script for the following problem: An IPv6-address is a 128-bit number. For convenience, this number is recorded in blocks of 16 bits in hexadecimal record, the blocks are separated by colons \u2014 8 blocks in total, each block has four hexadecimal digits. Here is an example of the correct record of a IPv6 address: \"0124:5678:90ab:cdef:0124:5678:90ab:cdef\". We'll call such format of recording an IPv6-address full.\n\nBesides the full record of an IPv6 address there is a short record format. The record of an IPv6 address can be shortened by removing one or more leading zeroes at the beginning of each block. However, each block should contain at least one digit in the short format. For example, the leading zeroes can be removed like that: \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:f19a:1000:0000\" <=\u2192<= \"a56f:d3:0:0124:01:f19a:1000:00\". There are more ways to shorten zeroes in this IPv6 address.\n\nSome IPv6 addresses contain long sequences of zeroes. Continuous sequences of 16-bit zero blocks can be shortened to \"::\". A sequence can consist of one or several consecutive blocks, with all 16 bits equal to 0. \n\nYou can see examples of zero block shortenings below:\n -  \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:0000:0000:0000\" <=\u2192<= \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001::\"; -  \"a56f:0000:0000:0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\" <=\u2192<= \"a56f::0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\"; -  \"a56f:0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\" <=\u2192<= \"a56f:0000::0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\"; -  \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:0000:0000:0000\" <=\u2192<= \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001::0000\"; -  \"0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000\" <=\u2192<= \"::\". \nIt is not allowed to shorten zero blocks in the address more than once. This means that the short record can't contain the sequence of characters \"::\" more than once. Otherwise, it will sometimes be impossible to determine the number of zero blocks, each represented by a double colon.\n\nThe format of the record of the IPv6 address after removing the leading zeroes and shortening the zero blocks is called short.\n\nYou've got several short records of IPv6 addresses. Restore their full record.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* \u2014 the number of records to restore (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100).\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains a string \u2014 the short IPv6 addresses. Each string only consists of string characters \"0123456789abcdef:\".\n\nIt is guaranteed that each short address is obtained by the way that is described in the statement from some full IPv6 address.. Output specification: For each short IPv6 address from the input print its full record on a separate line. Print the full records for the short IPv6 addresses in the order, in which the short records follow in the input.\nDemo input: ['6\\na56f:d3:0:0124:01:f19a:1000:00\\na56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001::\\na56f::0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\\na56f:0000::0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\\n::\\n0ea::4d:f4:6:0\\n'], Demo output: ['a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:f19a:1000:0000\\na56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:0000:0000:0000\\na56f:0000:0000:0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\\na56f:0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\\n0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000\\n00ea:0000:0000:0000:004d:00f4:0006:0000\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

This way, the rocket can be described by the string\u00a0\u2014 concatenation of letters, which correspond to the stages.\n\nThere are $n$ stages available. The rocket must contain exactly $k$ of them. Stages in the rocket should be ordered by their weight. So, after the stage with some letter can go only stage with a letter, which is at least two positions after in the alphabet (skipping one letter in between, or even more). For example, after letter 'c' can't go letters 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd', but can go letters 'e', 'f', ..., 'z'.\n\nFor the rocket to fly as far as possible, its weight should be minimal. The weight of the rocket is equal to the sum of the weights of its stages. The weight of the stage is the number of its letter in the alphabet. For example, the stage 'a 'weighs one ton,' b 'weighs two tons, and' z'\u00a0\u2014 $26$ tons.\n\nBuild the rocket with the minimal weight or determine, that it is impossible to build a rocket at all.

Its weight is $2+5+12+15=34$.\n\nIn the third example, $n=k=2$, so the rocket must have both stages: 'a' and 'b'.

As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1.

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.

Write a python script for the following problem: The research center Q has developed a new multi-core processor. The processor consists of *n* cores and has *k* cells of cache memory. Consider the work of this processor.\n\nAt each cycle each core of the processor gets one instruction: either do nothing, or the number of the memory cell (the core will write an information to the cell). After receiving the command, the core executes it immediately. Sometimes it happens that at one cycle, multiple cores try to write the information into a single cell. Unfortunately, the developers did not foresee the possibility of resolving conflicts between cores, so in this case there is a deadlock: all these cores and the corresponding memory cell are locked forever. Each of the locked cores ignores all further commands, and no core in the future will be able to record an information into the locked cell. If any of the cores tries to write an information into some locked cell, it is immediately locked.\n\nThe development team wants to explore the deadlock situation. Therefore, they need a program that will simulate the processor for a given set of instructions for each core within *m* cycles . You're lucky, this interesting work is entrusted to you. According to the instructions, during the *m* cycles define for each core the number of the cycle, during which it will become locked. It is believed that initially all cores and all memory cells are not locked.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=100).

The *i*-th line contains *m* integers: *x**i*1,<=*x**i*2,<=...,<=*x**im* (0<=\u2264<=*x**ij*<=\u2264<=*k*), where *x**ij* is the instruction that must be executed by the *i*-th core at the *j*-th cycle. If *x**ij* equals 0, then the corresponding instruction is \u00abdo nothing\u00bb. But if *x**ij* is a number from 1 to *k*, then the corresponding instruction is \u00abwrite information to the memory cell number *x**ij*\u00bb.\n\nWe assume that the cores are numbered from 1 to *n*, the work cycles are numbered from 1 to *m* and the memory cells are numbered from 1 to *k*.. Output specification: Print *n* lines. In the *i*-th line print integer *t**i*. This number should be equal to 0 if the *i*-th core won't be locked, or it should be equal to the number of the cycle when this core will be locked.\nDemo input: ['4 3 5\\n1 0 0\\n1 0 2\\n2 3 1\\n3 2 0\\n', '3 2 2\\n1 2\\n1 2\\n2 2\\n', '1 1 1\\n0\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n1\\n3\\n0\\n', '1\\n1\\n0\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

He's allowed to do exactly one move: he chooses two indices *i* and *j* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*j*<=\u2264<=*n*) and flips all values *a**k* for which their positions are in range [*i*,<=*j*] (that is *i*<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*j*). Flip the value of *x* means to apply operation *x*<==<=1 - *x*.\n\nThe goal of the game is that after exactly one move to obtain the maximum number of ones. Write a program to solve the little game of Iahub.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100). In the second line of the input there are *n* integers: *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. It is guaranteed that each of those *n* values is either 0 or 1..

That flip changes the sequence, it becomes: [1 1 1 0 1]. So, it contains four ones.

For every house with an outgoing water pipe and without an incoming water pipe, Lulu should install a water tank at that house.

Write a python script for the following problem: Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.\n\nShop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following *n* days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in *i*-th day *k**i* products will be put up for sale and exactly *l**i* clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any *f* days from *n* next for sell-outs. On each of *f* chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on *i*-th day shop planned to put up for sale *k**i* products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7*k**i* products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.\n\nNoora's task is to choose *f* days to maximize total number of sold products.

In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2,\u20096,\u20092,\u20092] respectively.

Write a python script for the following problem: Xenia the beginner programmer has a sequence *a*, consisting of 2*n* non-negative integers: *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a*2*n*. Xenia is currently studying bit operations. To better understand how they work, Xenia decided to calculate some value *v* for *a*.\n\nNamely, it takes several iterations to calculate value *v*. At the first iteration, Xenia writes a new sequence *a*1\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*2,<=*a*3\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*4,<=...,<=*a*2*n*<=-<=1\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*2*n*, consisting of 2*n*<=-<=1 elements. In other words, she writes down the bit-wise OR of adjacent elements of sequence *a*. At the second iteration, Xenia writes the bitwise exclusive OR of adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the first iteration. At the third iteration Xenia writes the bitwise OR of the adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the second iteration. And so on; the operations of bitwise exclusive OR and bitwise OR alternate. In the end, she obtains a sequence consisting of one element, and that element is *v*.\n\nLet's consider an example.

The result is *v*<==<=4.\n\nYou are given Xenia's initial sequence. But to calculate value *v* for a given sequence would be too easy, so you are given additional *m* queries. Each query is a pair of integers *p*,<=*b*. Query *p*,<=*b* means that you need to perform the assignment *a**p*<==<=*b*.

Then the alarm clocks are points with integer coordinates in this square.\n\nThe morning has come. All *n* alarm clocks in Inna's room are ringing, so Inna wants to turn them off. For that Inna has come up with an amusing game:\n -  First Inna chooses a type of segments that she will use throughout the game. The segments can be either vertical or horizontal. -  Then Inna makes multiple moves. In a single move, Inna can paint a segment of any length on the plane, she chooses its type at the beginning of the game (either vertical or horizontal), then all alarm clocks that are on this segment switch off. The game ends when all the alarm clocks are switched off. \nInna is very sleepy, so she wants to get through the alarm clocks as soon as possible.

Also, *b* can not be non-zero if *a* is zero.. Output specification: Print the only real number *x* (the desired distance value) in the only line in its decimal notation. \n\nThus if *x* is an integer, print it's integer value without decimal part and decimal point and without leading zeroes. \n\nOtherwise print *x* in a form of *p*.*q* such that *p* is an integer that have no leading zeroes (but may be equal to zero), and *q* is an integer that have no trailing zeroes (and may not be equal to zero).\nDemo input: ['8.549e2\\n', '8.549e3\\n', '0.33e0\\n'], Demo output: ['854.9\\n', '8549\\n', '0.33\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

The education is not easy because you need to have fundamental knowledge in different areas, which sometimes are not related to each other. \n\nFor example, you should know linguistics very well. You learn a structure of Reberland language as foreign language. In this language words are constructed according to the following rules. First you need to choose the \"root\" of the word \u2014 some string which has more than 4 letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3 symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction \u2014  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row.

Write a python script for the following problem: In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.\n\nThere are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.\n\nOfficer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:\n -  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$; -  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. \nFor example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\n\nThe structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.\n\nFormally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.\n\nBerland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.\n\nSuppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ \u2014 one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.\n\nLet's look at the following example:\n\nIf officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.\n\nIf officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.\n\nTo answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.\n\nYou should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i &lt; i$), where $p_i$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $i$. The commander has index $1$ and doesn't have any superiors.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query is given as a pair ($u_i, k_i$) ($1 \\le u_i, k_i \\le n$), where $u_i$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $k_i$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence.. Output specification: Print $q$ numbers, where the $i$-th number is the officer at the position $k_i$ in the list which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if it starts spreading from officer $u_i$. Print \"-1\" if the number of officers which receive the command is less than $k_i$.\n\nYou should process queries independently. They do not affect each other.\nDemo input: ['9 6\\n1 1 1 3 5 3 5 7\\n3 1\\n1 5\\n3 4\\n7 3\\n1 8\\n1 9\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n6\\n8\\n-1\\n9\\n4\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$.. Output specification: Print the only integer \u2014 maximum possible total time when the lamp is lit.\nDemo input: ['3 10\\n4 6 7\\n', '2 12\\n1 10\\n', '2 7\\n3 4\\n'], Demo output: ['8\\n', '9\\n', '6\\n']\nNote: In the first example, one of possible optimal solutions is to insert value $x = 3$ before $a_1$, so program will be $[3, 4, 6, 7]$ and time of lamp being lit equals $(3 - 0) + (6 - 4) + (10 - 7) = 8$. Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$."}]}}

Now we know that any Martian DNA contains at most *m* different nucleotides, numbered from 1 to *m*. Special characteristics of the Martian DNA prevent some nucleotide pairs from following consecutively in this chain. For example, if the nucleotide 1 and nucleotide 2 can not follow consecutively in the Martian DNA, then the chain of nucleotides [1, 2] is not a valid chain of Martian DNA, but the chain of nucleotides [2, 1] can be a valid chain (if there is no corresponding restriction). The number of nucleotide pairs that can't follow in the DNA chain consecutively, is *k*. \n\nThe needs of gene research required information about the quantity of correct *n*-long chains of the Martian DNA. Your task is to write a program that will calculate this value.\nInput specification: The first line contains three space-separated integers *n*,<=*m*,<=*k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1015, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=52, 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*m*2).\n\nNext *k* lines contain two characters each, without a space between them, representing a forbidden nucleotide pair. The first character represents the first nucleotide in the forbidden pair, the second character represents the second nucleotide.\n\nThe nucleotides with assigned numbers from 1 to 26 are represented by English alphabet letters from \"a\" to \"z\" (1 is an \"a\", 2 is a \"b\", ..., 26 is a \"z\").

Vasya and Petya want to divide all pieces of pizza into two continuous sectors in such way that the difference between angles of these sectors is minimal. Sector angle is sum of angles of all pieces in it. Pay attention, that one of sectors can be empty.\nInput specification: The first line contains one integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=360) \u00a0\u2014 the number of pieces into which the delivered pizza was cut.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=360) \u00a0\u2014 the angles of the sectors into which the pizza was cut. The sum of all *a**i* is 360.. Output specification: Print one integer \u00a0\u2014 the minimal difference between angles of sectors that will go to Vasya and Petya.\nDemo input: ['4\\n90 90 90 90\\n', '3\\n100 100 160\\n', '1\\n360\\n', '4\\n170 30 150 10\\n'], Demo output: ['0\\n', '40\\n', '360\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: In first sample Vasya can take 1 and 2 pieces, Petya can take 3 and 4 pieces. Then the answer is |(90\u2009+\u200990)\u2009-\u2009(90\u2009+\u200990)|\u2009=\u20090.\n\nIn third sample there is only one piece of pizza that can be taken by only one from Vasya and Petya. So the answer is |360\u2009-\u20090|\u2009=\u2009360.\n\nIn fourth sample Vasya can take 1 and 4 pieces, then Petya will take 2 and 3 pieces. So the answer is |(170\u2009+\u200910)\u2009-\u2009(30\u2009+\u2009150)|\u2009=\u20090.\n\nPicture explaning fourth sample:\n\n<img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/4bb3450aca241f92fedcba5479bf1b6d22cf813d.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\nBoth red and green sectors consist of two adjacent pieces of pizza. So Vasya can take green sector, then Petya will take red sector."}]}}

The box is special, since it has the ability to change gravity.\n\nThere are *n* columns of toy cubes in the box arranged in a line. The *i*-th column contains *a**i* cubes. At first, the gravity in the box is pulling the cubes downwards. When Chris switches the gravity, it begins to pull all the cubes to the right side of the box.

However, Vasilisa the Wise does not know what the box's secret is, since she cannot open it again. She hopes that you will help her one more time with that.\n\nThe box's lock looks as follows: it contains 4 identical deepenings for gems as a 2<=\u00d7<=2 square, and some integer numbers are written at the lock's edge near the deepenings. The example of a lock is given on the picture below.\n\nThe box is accompanied with 9 gems. Their shapes match the deepenings' shapes and each gem contains one number from 1 to 9 (each number is written on exactly one gem). The box will only open after it is decorated with gems correctly: that is, each deepening in the lock should be filled with exactly one gem. Also, the sums of numbers in the square's rows, columns and two diagonals of the square should match the numbers written at the lock's edge. For example, the above lock will open if we fill the deepenings with gems with numbers as is shown on the picture below.\n\nNow Vasilisa the Wise wants to define, given the numbers on the box's lock, which gems she should put in the deepenings to open the box. Help Vasilisa to solve this challenging task.\nInput specification: The input contains numbers written on the edges of the lock of the box. The first line contains space-separated integers *r*1 and *r*2 that define the required sums of numbers in the rows of the square. The second line contains space-separated integers *c*1 and *c*2 that define the required sums of numbers in the columns of the square. The third line contains space-separated integers *d*1 and *d*2 that define the required sums of numbers on the main and on the side diagonals of the square (1<=\u2264<=*r*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*1,<=*c*2,<=*d*1,<=*d*2<=\u2264<=20). Correspondence between the above 6 variables and places where they are written is shown on the picture below. For more clarifications please look at the second sample test that demonstrates the example given in the problem statement.. Output specification: Print the scheme of decorating the box with stones: two lines containing two space-separated integers from 1 to 9. The numbers should be pairwise different. If there is no solution for the given lock, then print the single number \"-1\" (without the quotes).\n\nIf there are several solutions, output any.\nDemo input: ['3 7\\n4 6\\n5 5\\n', '11 10\\n13 8\\n5 16\\n', '1 2\\n3 4\\n5 6\\n', '10 10\\n10 10\\n10 10\\n'], Demo output: ['1 2\\n3 4\\n', '4 7\\n9 1\\n', '-1\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: Pay attention to the last test from the statement: it is impossible to open the box because for that Vasilisa the Wise would need 4 identical gems containing number \"5\".

Xenia is currently studying bit operations. To better understand how they work, Xenia decided to calculate some value *v* for *a*.\n\nNamely, it takes several iterations to calculate value *v*. At the first iteration, Xenia writes a new sequence *a*1\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*2,<=*a*3\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*4,<=...,<=*a*2*n*<=-<=1\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*2*n*, consisting of 2*n*<=-<=1 elements. In other words, she writes down the bit-wise OR of adjacent elements of sequence *a*. At the second iteration, Xenia writes the bitwise exclusive OR of adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the first iteration. At the third iteration Xenia writes the bitwise OR of the adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the second iteration. And so on; the operations of bitwise exclusive OR and bitwise OR alternate. In the end, she obtains a sequence consisting of one element, and that element is *v*.\n\nLet's consider an example.

The result is *v*<==<=4.\n\nYou are given Xenia's initial sequence. But to calculate value *v* for a given sequence would be too easy, so you are given additional *m* queries. Each query is a pair of integers *p*,<=*b*. Query *p*,<=*b* means that you need to perform the assignment *a**p*<==<=*b*.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: For some time the program of rounding numbers that had been developed by the Codeforces participants during one of the previous rounds, helped the citizens of Far Far Away to convert numbers into a more easily readable format. However, as time went by, the economy of the Far Far Away developed and the scale of operations grew. So the King ordered to found the Bank of Far Far Away and very soon even the rounding didn't help to quickly determine even the order of the numbers involved in operations. Besides, rounding a number to an integer wasn't very convenient as a bank needed to operate with all numbers with accuracy of up to 0.01, and not up to an integer.\n\nThe King issued yet another order: to introduce financial format to represent numbers denoting amounts of money. The formal rules of storing a number in the financial format are as follows: \n -  A number contains the integer part and the fractional part. The two parts are separated with a character \".\" (decimal point). -  To make digits in the integer part of a number easier to read, they are split into groups of three digits, starting from the least significant ones. The groups are separated with the character \",\" (comma). For example, if the integer part of a number equals 12345678, then it will be stored in the financial format as 12,345,678 -  In the financial format a number's fractional part should contain exactly two digits. So, if the initial number (the number that is converted into the financial format) contains less than two digits in the fractional part (or contains no digits at all), it is complemented with zeros until its length equals 2. If the fractional part contains more than two digits, the extra digits are simply discarded (they are not rounded: see sample tests). -  When a number is stored in the financial format, the minus sign is not written. Instead, if the initial number had the minus sign, the result is written in round brackets. -  Please keep in mind that the bank of Far Far Away operates using an exotic foreign currency \u2014 snakes ($), that's why right before the number in the financial format we should put the sign \"$\". If the number should be written in the brackets, then the snake sign should also be inside the brackets. \nFor example, by the above given rules number 2012 will be stored in the financial format as \"$2,012.00\" and number -12345678.9 will be stored as \"($12,345,678.90)\".\n\nThe merchants of Far Far Away visited you again and expressed much hope that you supply them with the program that can convert arbitrary numbers to the financial format. Can you help them?\nInput specification: The input contains a number that needs to be converted into financial format. The number's notation length does not exceed 100 characters, including (possible) signs \"-\" (minus) and \".\" (decimal point). The number's notation is correct, that is: \n -  The number's notation only contains characters from the set {\"0\" \u2013 \"9\", \"-\", \".\"}. -  The decimal point (if it is present) is unique and is preceded and followed by a non-zero quantity on decimal digits -  A number cannot start with digit 0, except for a case when its whole integer part equals zero (in this case the integer parts is guaranteed to be a single zero: \"0\"). -  The minus sign (if it is present) is unique and stands in the very beginning of the number's notation -  If a number is identically equal to 0 (that is, if it is written as, for example, \"0\" or \"0.000\"), than it is not preceded by the minus sign. -  The input data contains no spaces. -  The number's notation contains at least one decimal digit.. Output specification: Print the number given in the input in the financial format by the rules described in the problem statement.\nDemo input: ['2012\\n', '0.000\\n', '-0.00987654321\\n', '-12345678.9\\n'], Demo output: ['$2,012.00', '$0.00', '($0.00)', '($12,345,678.90)']\nNote: Pay attention to the second and third sample tests. They show that the sign of a number in the financial format (and consequently, the presence or absence of brackets) is determined solely by the sign of the initial number. It does not depend on the sign of the number you got after translating the number to the financial format."}]}}

The *i*-th character of the string will be '0' if the *i*-th room is free, and '1' if the *i*-th room is occupied. It is guaranteed that at least *k*<=+<=1 characters of this string are '0', so there exists at least one possible choice of *k*<=+<=1 rooms for Farmer John and his cows to stay in..

The distance to the farthest cow is 2. Note that it is impossible to make this distance 1, as there is no block of three consecutive unoccupied rooms.\n\nIn the second sample, Farmer John can book room 1 for himself and room 3 for his single cow. The distance between him and his cow is 2.\n\nIn the third sample, Farmer John books all three available rooms, taking the middle room for himself so that both cows are next to him. His distance from the farthest cow is 1."}]}}

Namely, the Olympiad number *i* should be prepared by *p**i* people for *t**i* days, the preparation for the Olympiad should be a continuous period of time and end exactly one day before the Olympiad. On the day of the Olympiad the juries who have prepared it, already do not work on it.\n\nFor example, if the Olympiad is held on December 9th and the preparation takes 7 people and 6 days, all seven members of the jury will work on the problems of the Olympiad from December, 3rd to December, 8th (the jury members won't be working on the problems of this Olympiad on December 9th, that is, some of them can start preparing problems for some other Olympiad). And if the Olympiad is held on November 3rd and requires 5 days of training, the members of the jury will work from October 29th to November 2nd.\n\nIn order not to overload the jury the following rule was introduced: one member of the jury can not work on the same day on the tasks for different Olympiads. Write a program that determines what the minimum number of people must be part of the jury so that all Olympiads could be prepared in time.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* \u2014 the number of Olympiads in 2013 (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100). Each of the following *n* lines contains four integers *m**i*, *d**i*, *p**i* and *t**i* \u2014 the month and day of the Olympiad (given without leading zeroes), the needed number of the jury members and the time needed to prepare the *i*-th Olympiad (1<=\u2264<=*m**i*<=\u2264<=12, *d**i*<=\u2265<=1, 1<=\u2264<=*p**i*,<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=100), *d**i* doesn't exceed the number of days in month *m**i*. The Olympiads are given in the arbitrary order. Several Olympiads can take place in one day.\n\nUse the modern (Gregorian) calendar in the solution. Note that all dates are given in the year 2013. This is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. Please note, the preparation of some Olympiad can start in 2012 year..

Then he spends 2 more seconds to enter 2 wrong passwords, again waits 5 seconds and, finally, enters the correct password spending 1 more second. In summary in the worst case he is able to be authorized in 15 seconds.\n\nConsider the second sample case. There is no way of entering passwords and get the access to the site blocked. As soon as the required password has length of 2, Vanya enters all passwords of length 1 anyway, spending 2 seconds for that. Then, in the best case, he immediately enters the correct password and the answer for the best case is 3, but in the worst case he enters wrong password of length 2 and only then the right one, spending 4 seconds at all."}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: An IPv6-address is a 128-bit number. For convenience, this number is recorded in blocks of 16 bits in hexadecimal record, the blocks are separated by colons \u2014 8 blocks in total, each block has four hexadecimal digits. Here is an example of the correct record of a IPv6 address: \"0124:5678:90ab:cdef:0124:5678:90ab:cdef\". We'll call such format of recording an IPv6-address full.\n\nBesides the full record of an IPv6 address there is a short record format. The record of an IPv6 address can be shortened by removing one or more leading zeroes at the beginning of each block. However, each block should contain at least one digit in the short format. For example, the leading zeroes can be removed like that: \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:f19a:1000:0000\" <=\u2192<= \"a56f:d3:0:0124:01:f19a:1000:00\". There are more ways to shorten zeroes in this IPv6 address.\n\nSome IPv6 addresses contain long sequences of zeroes. Continuous sequences of 16-bit zero blocks can be shortened to \"::\". A sequence can consist of one or several consecutive blocks, with all 16 bits equal to 0. \n\nYou can see examples of zero block shortenings below:\n -  \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:0000:0000:0000\" <=\u2192<= \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001::\"; -  \"a56f:0000:0000:0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\" <=\u2192<= \"a56f::0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\"; -  \"a56f:0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\" <=\u2192<= \"a56f:0000::0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\"; -  \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:0000:0000:0000\" <=\u2192<= \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001::0000\"; -  \"0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000\" <=\u2192<= \"::\". \nIt is not allowed to shorten zero blocks in the address more than once. This means that the short record can't contain the sequence of characters \"::\" more than once. Otherwise, it will sometimes be impossible to determine the number of zero blocks, each represented by a double colon.\n\nThe format of the record of the IPv6 address after removing the leading zeroes and shortening the zero blocks is called short.\n\nYou've got several short records of IPv6 addresses. Restore their full record.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* \u2014 the number of records to restore (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100).\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains a string \u2014 the short IPv6 addresses. Each string only consists of string characters \"0123456789abcdef:\".\n\nIt is guaranteed that each short address is obtained by the way that is described in the statement from some full IPv6 address.. Output specification: For each short IPv6 address from the input print its full record on a separate line. Print the full records for the short IPv6 addresses in the order, in which the short records follow in the input.\nDemo input: ['6\\na56f:d3:0:0124:01:f19a:1000:00\\na56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001::\\na56f::0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\\na56f:0000::0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\\n::\\n0ea::4d:f4:6:0\\n'], Demo output: ['a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:f19a:1000:0000\\na56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:0000:0000:0000\\na56f:0000:0000:0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\\na56f:0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\\n0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000\\n00ea:0000:0000:0000:004d:00f4:0006:0000\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Note that at each stop all exiting passengers exit before any entering passenger enters the tram.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single number *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the number of the tram's stops. \n\nThen *n* lines follow, each contains two integers *a**i* and *b**i* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the number of passengers that exits the tram at the *i*-th stop, and the number of passengers that enter the tram at the *i*-th stop. The stops are given from the first to the last stop in the order of tram's movement.\n -  The number of people who exit at a given stop does not exceed the total number of people in the tram immediately before it arrives at the stop. More formally, . This particularly means that *a*1<==<=0. -  At the last stop, all the passengers exit the tram and it becomes empty. More formally, . -  No passenger will enter the train at the last stop. That is, *b**n*<==<=0.. Output specification: Print a single integer denoting the minimum possible capacity of the tram (0 is allowed).\nDemo input: ['4\\n0 3\\n2 5\\n4 2\\n4 0\\n'], Demo output: ['6\\n']\nNote: For the first example, a capacity of 6 is sufficient: \n -  At the first stop, the number of passengers inside the tram before arriving is 0. Then, 3 passengers enter the tram, and the number of passengers inside the tram becomes 3. -  At the second stop, 2 passengers exit the tram (1 passenger remains inside). Then, 5 passengers enter the tram. There are 6 passengers inside the tram now. -  At the third stop, 4 passengers exit the tram (2 passengers remain inside). Then, 2 passengers enter the tram. There are 4 passengers inside the tram now. -  Finally, all the remaining passengers inside the tram exit the tram at the last stop. There are no passenger inside the tram now, which is in line with the constraints. \nSince the number of passengers inside the tram never exceeds 6, a capacity of 6 is sufficient. Furthermore it is not possible for the tram to have a capacity less than 6. Hence, 6 is the correct answer."}]}}

A photographic rifle is obviously for Sharic who loves hunting and fish is for Matroskin, but for whom was a new video game console meant? Every one of the three friends claimed that the present is for him and nearly quarreled. Uncle Fyodor had an idea how to solve the problem justly: they should suppose that the console was sent to all three of them and play it in turns. Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up \u2014 who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that\u2019s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player wins.

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow.

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes. The second line contains integers *x**c* and *y**c* \u2014 the initial square's coordinates (1<=\u2264<=*x**c*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y**c*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nThe third line contains an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the number of vectors. Then follow *k* lines, each of them contains two integers *dx**i* and *dy**i* (|*dx**i*|,<=|*dy**i*|<=\u2264<=109,<=|*dx*|<=+<=|*dy*|<=\u2265<=1)..

So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091). He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

Your task is to determine, how many letters Nastya can remove before she will be stopped by Sergey.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the word *p* can be obtained by removing the letters from word *t*.\nInput specification: The first and second lines of the input contain the words *t* and *p*, respectively. Words are composed of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet (1<=\u2264<=|*p*|<=&lt;<=|*t*|<=\u2264<=200<=000). It is guaranteed that the word *p* can be obtained by removing the letters from word *t*.\n\nNext line contains a permutation *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a*|*t*| of letter indices that specifies the order in which Nastya removes letters of *t* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=|*t*|, all *a**i* are distinct).. Output specification: Print a single integer number, the maximum number of letters that Nastya can remove.\nDemo input: ['ababcba\\nabb\\n5 3 4 1 7 6 2\\n', 'bbbabb\\nbb\\n1 6 3 4 2 5\\n'], Demo output: ['3', '4']\nNote: In the first sample test sequence of removing made by Nastya looks like this:\n\n\"ababcba\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ababcba\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ababcba\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ababcba\" \n\nNastya can not continue, because it is impossible to get word \"abb\" from word \"ababcba\".\n\nSo, Nastya will remove only three letters."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow.

Consider the work of this processor.\n\nAt each cycle each core of the processor gets one instruction: either do nothing, or the number of the memory cell (the core will write an information to the cell). After receiving the command, the core executes it immediately. Sometimes it happens that at one cycle, multiple cores try to write the information into a single cell. Unfortunately, the developers did not foresee the possibility of resolving conflicts between cores, so in this case there is a deadlock: all these cores and the corresponding memory cell are locked forever. Each of the locked cores ignores all further commands, and no core in the future will be able to record an information into the locked cell. If any of the cores tries to write an information into some locked cell, it is immediately locked.\n\nThe development team wants to explore the deadlock situation. Therefore, they need a program that will simulate the processor for a given set of instructions for each core within *m* cycles . You're lucky, this interesting work is entrusted to you. According to the instructions, during the *m* cycles define for each core the number of the cycle, during which it will become locked.

Write a python script for the following problem: Perhaps many have heard that the World Biathlon Championship has finished. Although our hero Valera was not present at this spectacular event himself and only watched it on TV, it excited him so much that he decided to enroll in a biathlon section.\n\nOf course, biathlon as any sport, proved very difficult in practice. It takes much time and effort. Workouts, workouts, and workouts, \u2014 that's what awaited Valera on his way to great achievements in biathlon.\n\nAs for the workouts, you all probably know that every professional biathlete should ski fast and shoot precisely at the shooting range. Only in this case you can hope to be successful, because running and shooting are the two main components of biathlon. Valera has been diligent in his ski trainings, which is why he runs really fast, however, his shooting accuracy is nothing to write home about.\n\nOn a biathlon base where Valera is preparing for the competition, there is a huge rifle range with *n* targets. Each target have shape of a circle, and the center of each circle is located on the *Ox* axis. At the last training session Valera made the total of *m* shots. To make monitoring of his own results easier for him, one rather well-known programmer (of course it is you) was commissioned to write a program that would reveal how many and which targets Valera hit. More specifically, for each target the program must print the number of the first successful shot (in the target), or \"-1\" if this was not hit. The target is considered hit if the shot is inside the circle or on its boundary. Valera is counting on you and perhaps, thanks to you he will one day win international competitions.\nInput specification: The first line of the input file contains the integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=104), which is the number of targets.

In order to preserve image details, the size of a group must not be greater than $k$, and each color should belong to exactly one group.\n\nFinally, the students will replace the color of each pixel in the array with that color\u2019s assigned group key.\n\nTo better understand the effect, here is an image of a basking turtle where the Posterization Filter was applied with increasing $k$ to the right. \n\nTo make the process of checking the final answer easier, Professor Ibrahim wants students to divide the groups and assign the keys in a way that produces the lexicographically smallest possible array.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$, $1 \\leq k \\leq 256$), the number of pixels in the image, and the maximum size of a group, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$ ($0 \\leq p_i \\leq 255$), where $p_i$ is the color of the $i$-th pixel.. Output specification: Print $n$ space-separated integers; the lexicographically smallest possible array that represents the image after applying the Posterization filter.\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n2 14 3 4\\n', '5 2\\n0 2 1 255 254\\n'], Demo output: ['0 12 3 3\\n', '0 1 1 254 254\\n']\nNote: One possible way to group colors and assign keys for the first sample:\n\nColor $2$ belongs to the group $[0,2]$, with group key $0$.\n\nColor $14$ belongs to the group $[12,14]$, with group key $12$.\n\nColors $3$ and $4$ belong to group $[3, 5]$, with group key $3$.\n\nOther groups won't affect the result so they are not listed here."}]}}

Now they are playing a game on a grid made of *n* horizontal and *m* vertical sticks.\n\nAn intersection point is any point on the grid which is formed by the intersection of one horizontal stick and one vertical stick.\n\nIn the grid shown below, *n*<==<=3 and *m*<==<=3. There are *n*<=+<=*m*<==<=6 sticks in total (horizontal sticks are shown in red and vertical sticks are shown in green). There are *n*\u00b7*m*<==<=9 intersection points, numbered from 1 to 9.\n\nThe rules of the game are very simple. The players move in turns. Akshat won gold, so he makes the first move. During his/her move, a player must choose any remaining intersection point and remove from the grid all sticks which pass through this point. A player will lose the game if he/she cannot make a move (i.e. there are no intersection points remaining on the grid at his/her move).\n\nAssume that both players play optimally. Who will win the game?\nInput specification: The first line of input contains two space-separated integers, *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100)..

The resulting grid will look like this.\n\nNow there is only one remaining intersection point (i.e. 4). Malvika must choose it and remove both remaining sticks. After her move the grid will be empty.\n\nIn the empty grid, Akshat cannot make any move, hence he will lose.\n\nSince all 4 intersection points of the grid are equivalent, Akshat will lose no matter which one he picks."}]}}

You answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10<=-<=6. \n\nNamely: let's assume that your answer is *a*, and the answer of the jury is *b*. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if .\nDemo input: ['2 1 1\\n1 5\\n', '4 2 1\\n1 4 2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['6.00000000\\n', '6.50000000\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, one of the optimal solutions is to move candidate 1 to the first city and candidate 2 to the second.\n\nIn the second sample, the optimal solution is to pick candidates 3 and 4 for the first city, and candidate 2 for the second one.

Its main functionality is that two members can become friends (then they can talk with each other and share funny pictures).\n\nThere are *n* members, numbered 1 through *n*. *m* pairs of members are friends. Of course, a member can't be a friend with themselves.\n\nLet A-B denote that members A and B are friends. Limak thinks that a network is reasonable if and only if the following condition is satisfied: For every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z then also X-Z.\n\nFor example: if Alan and Bob are friends, and Bob and Ciri are friends, then Alan and Ciri should be friends as well.\n\nCan you help Limak and check if the network is reasonable? Print \"YES\" or \"NO\" accordingly, without the quotes.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contain two integers *n* and *m* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=150<=000, )\u00a0\u2014 the number of members and the number of pairs of members that are friends.\n\nThe *i*-th of the next *m* lines contains two distinct integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*a**i*<=\u2260<=*b**i*). Members *a**i* and *b**i* are friends with each other. No pair of members will appear more than once in the input.. Output specification: If the given network is reasonable, print \"YES\" in a single line (without the quotes). Otherwise, print \"NO\" in a single line (without the quotes).\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n1 3\\n3 4\\n1 4\\n', '4 4\\n3 1\\n2 3\\n3 4\\n1 2\\n', '10 4\\n4 3\\n5 10\\n8 9\\n1 2\\n', '3 2\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n', 'YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: The drawings below show the situation in the first sample (on the left) and in the second sample (on the right). Each edge represents two members that are friends.

George estimates the *i*-th problem's complexity by integer *b**i*.\n\nTo make the round good, he needs to put at least *n* problems there. Besides, he needs to have at least one problem with complexity exactly *a*1, at least one with complexity exactly *a*2, ..., and at least one with complexity exactly *a**n*. Of course, the round can also have problems with other complexities.\n\nGeorge has a poor imagination. It's easier for him to make some already prepared problem simpler than to come up with a new one and prepare it. George is magnificent at simplifying problems. He can simplify any already prepared problem with complexity *c* to any positive integer complexity *d* (*c*<=\u2265<=*d*), by changing limits on the input data.\n\nHowever, nothing is so simple. George understood that even if he simplifies some problems, he can run out of problems for a good round.

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes. The second line contains integers *x**c* and *y**c* \u2014 the initial square's coordinates (1<=\u2264<=*x**c*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y**c*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nThe third line contains an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the number of vectors. Then follow *k* lines, each of them contains two integers *dx**i* and *dy**i* (|*dx**i*|,<=|*dy**i*|<=\u2264<=109,<=|*dx*|<=+<=|*dy*|<=\u2265<=1).. Output specification: Print the single number \u2014 the number of steps Vasya had made.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.\nDemo input: ['4 5\\n1 1\\n3\\n1 1\\n1 1\\n0 -2\\n', '10 10\\n1 2\\n1\\n-1 0\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: In the first sample Vasya is initially positioned at square (1,\u20091) and makes 3 steps by the first vector (1,\u20091). So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091). He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

There are *n* camomiles growing in the field, possessing the numbers of petals equal to *a*1,<=*a*2,<=... *a**n*. Marina wants to pick a bouquet with the maximal possible total number of petals so that the result would still be \"Loves\". Help her do that; find the maximal number of petals possible in the bouquet.\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), which is the number of flowers growing in the field. The second line contains *n* integers *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) which represent the number of petals on a given *i*-th camomile.. Output specification: Print a single number which is the maximal number of petals in the bouquet, the fortune telling on which would result in \"Loves\". If there are no such bouquet, print 0 instead. The bouquet may consist of a single flower.\nDemo input: ['1\\n1\\n', '1\\n2\\n', '3\\n5 6 7\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '0\\n', '13\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

However, Vasilisa the Wise does not know what the box's secret is, since she cannot open it again. She hopes that you will help her one more time with that.\n\nThe box's lock looks as follows: it contains 4 identical deepenings for gems as a 2<=\u00d7<=2 square, and some integer numbers are written at the lock's edge near the deepenings. The example of a lock is given on the picture below.\n\nThe box is accompanied with 9 gems. Their shapes match the deepenings' shapes and each gem contains one number from 1 to 9 (each number is written on exactly one gem). The box will only open after it is decorated with gems correctly: that is, each deepening in the lock should be filled with exactly one gem. Also, the sums of numbers in the square's rows, columns and two diagonals of the square should match the numbers written at the lock's edge. For example, the above lock will open if we fill the deepenings with gems with numbers as is shown on the picture below.\n\nNow Vasilisa the Wise wants to define, given the numbers on the box's lock, which gems she should put in the deepenings to open the box. Help Vasilisa to solve this challenging task.\nInput specification: The input contains numbers written on the edges of the lock of the box. The first line contains space-separated integers *r*1 and *r*2 that define the required sums of numbers in the rows of the square.

Recently, he has decided to take a couple of old songs and make dubstep remixes from them.\n\nLet's assume that a song consists of some number of words. To make the dubstep remix of this song, Vasya inserts a certain number of words \"WUB\" before the first word of the song (the number may be zero), after the last word (the number may be zero), and between words (at least one between any pair of neighbouring words), and then the boy glues together all the words, including \"WUB\", in one string and plays the song at the club.\n\nFor example, a song with words \"I AM X\" can transform into a dubstep remix as \"WUBWUBIWUBAMWUBWUBX\" and cannot transform into \"WUBWUBIAMWUBX\".\n\nRecently, Petya has heard Vasya's new dubstep track, but since he isn't into modern music, he decided to find out what was the initial song that Vasya remixed. Help Petya restore the original song.\nInput specification: The input consists of a single non-empty string, consisting only of uppercase English letters, the string's length doesn't exceed 200 characters. It is guaranteed that before Vasya remixed the song, no word contained substring \"WUB\" in it; Vasya didn't change the word order. It is also guaranteed that initially the song had at least one word.. Output specification: Print the words of the initial song that Vasya used to make a dubsteb remix. Separate the words with a space.\nDemo input: ['WUBWUBABCWUB\\n', 'WUBWEWUBAREWUBWUBTHEWUBCHAMPIONSWUBMYWUBFRIENDWUB\\n'], Demo output: ['ABC ', 'WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS MY FRIEND ']\nNote: In the first sample: \"WUBWUBABCWUB\" = \"WUB\" + \"WUB\" + \"ABC\" + \"WUB\". That means that the song originally consisted of a single word \"ABC\", and all words \"WUB\" were added by Vasya.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya added a single word \"WUB\" between all neighbouring words, in the beginning and in the end, except for words \"ARE\" and \"THE\" \u2014 between them Vasya added two \"WUB\"."}]}}

No two friends have the same value *t**i*.\n\nSpring is starting and the Winter sleep is over for bears. Limak has just woken up and logged in. All his friends still sleep and thus none of them is online. Some (maybe all) of them will appear online in the next hours, one at a time.\n\nThe system displays friends who are online. On the screen there is space to display at most *k* friends. If there are more than *k* friends online then the system displays only *k* best of them\u00a0\u2014 those with biggest *t**i*.\n\nYour task is to handle queries of two types:\n -  \"1 id\"\u00a0\u2014 Friend *id* becomes online. It's guaranteed that he wasn't online before. -  \"2 id\"\u00a0\u2014 Check whether friend *id* is displayed by the system.

There are the following 8 queries:\n 1.  \"1 3\"\u00a0\u2014 Friend 3 becomes online. 1.  \"2 4\"\u00a0\u2014 We should check if friend 4 is displayed. He isn't even online and thus we print \"NO\". 1.  \"2 3\"\u00a0\u2014 We should check if friend 3 is displayed. Right now he is the only friend online and the system displays him. We should print \"YES\". 1.  \"1 1\"\u00a0\u2014 Friend 1 becomes online. The system now displays both friend 1 and friend 3. 1.  \"1 2\"\u00a0\u2014 Friend 2 becomes online.

Write a python script for the following problem: Mad scientist Mike does not use slow hard disks. His modification of a hard drive has not one, but *n* different heads that can read data in parallel.\n\nWhen viewed from the side, Mike's hard drive is an endless array of tracks. The tracks of the array are numbered from left to right with integers, starting with 1. In the initial state the *i*-th reading head is above the track number *h**i*. For each of the reading heads, the hard drive's firmware can move the head exactly one track to the right or to the left, or leave it on the current track. During the operation each head's movement does not affect the movement of the other heads: the heads can change their relative order; there can be multiple reading heads above any of the tracks. A track is considered read if at least one head has visited this track. In particular, all of the tracks numbered *h*1, *h*2, ..., *h**n* have been read at the beginning of the operation.\n\nMike needs to read the data on *m* distinct tracks with numbers *p*1, *p*2, ..., *p**m*. Determine the minimum time the hard drive firmware needs to move the heads and read all the given tracks. Note that an arbitrary number of other tracks can also be read.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers *n*, *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of disk heads and the number of tracks to read, accordingly.

The nginx configuration file Dustin has to add comments to has *m* commands.

Write a python script for the following problem: The ancient Berlanders believed that the longer the name, the more important its bearer is. Thus, Berland kings were famous for their long names. But long names are somewhat inconvenient, so the Berlanders started to abbreviate the names of their kings. They called every king by the first letters of its name. Thus, the king, whose name was Victorious Vasily Pupkin, was always called by the berlanders VVP.\n\nIn Berland over its long history many dynasties of kings replaced each other, but they were all united by common traditions. Thus, according to one Berland traditions, to maintain stability in the country, the first name of the heir should be the same as the last name his predecessor (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the heir coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the predecessor). Berlanders appreciate stability, so this tradition has never been broken. Also Berlanders like perfection, so another tradition requires that the first name of the first king in the dynasty coincides with the last name of the last king in this dynasty (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the first king coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the last king). This tradition, of course, has also been always observed.\n\nThe name of a dynasty is formed by very simple rules: we take all the short names of the kings in the order in which they ruled, and write them in one line. Thus, a dynasty of kings \"ab\" and \"ba\" is called \"abba\", and the dynasty, which had only the king \"abca\", is called \"abca\".\n\nVasya, a historian, has recently found a list of abbreviated names of all Berland kings and their relatives. Help Vasya to find the maximally long name of the dynasty that could have existed in Berland.\n\nNote that in his list all the names are ordered by the time, that is, if name *A* is earlier in the list than *B*, then if *A* and *B* were kings, then king *A* ruled before king *B*.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=5\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of names in Vasya's list.

Write a python script for the following problem: First-rate specialists graduate from Berland State Institute of Peace and Friendship. You are one of the most talented students in this university. The education is not easy because you need to have fundamental knowledge in different areas, which sometimes are not related to each other. \n\nFor example, you should know linguistics very well. You learn a structure of Reberland language as foreign language. In this language words are constructed according to the following rules. First you need to choose the \"root\" of the word \u2014 some string which has more than 4 letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3 symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction \u2014  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row. All these strings are considered to be suffixes of the word (this time we use word \"suffix\" to describe a morpheme but not the few last characters of the string as you may used to). \n\nHere is one exercise that you have found in your task list. You are given the word *s*. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language. \n\nTwo strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match. \n\nLet's look at the example: the word *abacabaca* is given. This word can be obtained in the following ways: , where the root of the word is overlined, and suffixes are marked by \"corners\". Thus, the set of possible suffixes for this word is {*aca*,<=*ba*,<=*ca*}.\nInput specification: The only line contains a string *s* (5<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=104) consisting of lowercase English letters..

The length of the root equals 5, so no string can be used as a suffix."}]}}

Pari loves integers with even length (i.e. the numbers with even number of digits), so she tries to see a lot of big palindrome numbers with even length (like a 2-digit 11 or 6-digit 122221), so maybe she could see something in them.\n\nNow Pari asks you to write a program that gets a huge integer *n* from the input and tells what is the *n*-th even-length positive palindrome number?\nInput specification: The only line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=10100<=000).. Output specification: Print the *n*-th even-length palindrome number.\nDemo input: ['1\\n', '10\\n'], Demo output: ['11\\n', '1001\\n']\nNote: The first 10 even-length palindrome numbers are 11,\u200922,\u200933,\u2009... ,\u200988,\u200999 and 1001."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Young Teodor enjoys drawing. His favourite hobby is drawing segments with integer borders inside his huge [1;*m*] segment. One day Teodor noticed that picture he just drawn has one interesting feature: there doesn't exist an integer point, that belongs each of segments in the picture. Having discovered this fact, Teodor decided to share it with Sasha.\n\nSasha knows that Teodor likes to show off so he never trusts him. Teodor wants to prove that he can be trusted sometimes, so he decided to convince Sasha that there is no such integer point in his picture, which belongs to each segment. However Teodor is lazy person and neither wills to tell Sasha all coordinates of segments' ends nor wills to tell him their amount, so he suggested Sasha to ask him series of questions 'Given the integer point *x**i*, how many segments in Fedya's picture contain that point?', promising to tell correct answers for this questions.\n\nBoth boys are very busy studying and don't have much time, so they ask you to find out how many questions can Sasha ask Teodor, that having only answers on his questions, Sasha can't be sure that Teodor isn't lying to him. Note that Sasha doesn't know amount of segments in Teodor's picture. Sure, Sasha is smart person and never asks about same point twice.\nInput specification: First line of input contains two integer numbers: *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 amount of segments of Teodor's picture and maximal coordinate of point that Sasha can ask about.\n\n*i*th of next *n* lines contains two integer numbers *l**i* and *r**i* (1<=\u2264<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*m*)\u00a0\u2014 left and right ends of *i*th segment in the picture.

Then if the girl chooses the third and the fourth subarrays then: \n -  the first flower adds 1\u00b71<==<=1 to the girl's happiness, because he is in one of chosen subarrays, -  the second flower adds (<=-<=2)\u00b71<==<=<=-<=2, because he is in one of chosen subarrays, -  the third flower adds 1\u00b72<==<=2, because he is in two of chosen subarrays, -  the fourth flower adds 3\u00b72<==<=6, because he is in two of chosen subarrays, -  the fifth flower adds (<=-<=4)\u00b70<==<=0, because he is in no chosen subarrays. \nThus, in total 1<=+<=(<=-<=2)<=+<=2<=+<=6<=+<=0<==<=7 is added to the girl's happiness. Alyona wants to choose such subarrays from those suggested by the mother that the value added to her happiness would be as large as possible.

Given two integers *l* and *r* (1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=*r*<=\u2264<=*n*), ask the sum of all elements in the sequence *a**l*,<=*a**l*<=+<=1,<=...,<=*a**r*. 1.  Given two integers *l* and *r* (1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=*r*<=\u2264<=*n*), let each element *x* in the sequence *a**l*,<=*a**l*<=+<=1,<=...,<=*a**r* becomes *x*3. In other words, apply an assignments *a**l*<==<=*a**l*3,<=*a**l*<=+<=1<==<=*a**l*<=+<=13,<=...,<=*a**r*<==<=*a**r*3. \nFor every query of type 1, output the answer to it.\n\nTiny himself surely cannot work it out, so he asks you for help. In addition, Tiny is a prime lover. He tells you that because the answer may be too huge, you should only output it modulo 95542721 (this number is a prime number).\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105), representing the length of the sequence. The second line contains *n* space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109).\n\nThe third line contains an integer *q* (1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=105), representing the number of queries. Then follow *q* lines. Each line contains three integers *t**i* (1<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=2), *l**i*, *r**i* (1<=\u2264<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*), where *t**i* stands for the type of the query while *l**i* and *r**i* is the parameters of the query, correspondingly.. Output specification: For each 1-type query, print the answer to it per line.\n\nYou should notice that each printed number should be non-negative and less than 95542721.\nDemo input: ['8\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\\n5\\n1 2 5\\n2 2 5\\n1 2 5\\n2 3 6\\n1 4 7\\n'], Demo output: ['14\\n224\\n2215492\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Many people will surely be willing to visit this splendid shrine of high culture.\n\nIn Mainframe a standard pack of 52 cards is used to play blackjack. The pack contains cards of 13 values: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jacks, queens, kings and aces. Each value also exists in one of four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. Also, each card earns some value in points assigned to it: cards with value from two to ten earn from 2 to 10 points, correspondingly. An ace can either earn 1 or 11, whatever the player wishes. The picture cards (king, queen and jack) earn 10 points. The number of points a card earns does not depend on the suit. The rules of the game are very simple. The player gets two cards, if the sum of points of those cards equals *n*, then the player wins, otherwise the player loses.\n\nThe player has already got the first card, it's the queen of spades.

Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any *f* days from *n* next for sell-outs. On each of *f* chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on *i*-th day shop planned to put up for sale *k**i* products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7*k**i* products.

After this work, she finds out all subsegments of the garland containing pieces of only colour *c* \u2014 Brother Koyomi's favourite one, and takes the length of the longest among them to be the Koyomity of the garland.\n\nFor instance, let's say the garland is represented by \"kooomo\", and Brother Koyomi's favourite colour is \"o\". Among all subsegments containing pieces of \"o\" only, \"ooo\" is the longest, with a length of 3. Thus the Koyomity of this garland equals 3.\n\nBut problem arises as Nadeko is unsure about Brother Koyomi's favourite colour, and has swaying ideas on the amount of work to do.

Your task is find a path whose value is the largest.\nInput specification: The first line contains two positive integers $n, m$ ($1 \\leq n, m \\leq 300\\,000$), denoting that the graph has $n$ nodes and $m$ directed edges.\n\nThe second line contains a string $s$ with only lowercase English letters. The $i$-th character is the letter assigned to the $i$-th node.\n\nThen $m$ lines follow. Each line contains two integers $x, y$ ($1 \\leq x, y \\leq n$), describing a directed edge from $x$ to $y$. Note that $x$ can be equal to $y$ and there can be multiple edges between $x$ and $y$. Also the graph can be not connected.. Output specification: Output a single line with a single integer denoting the largest value. If the value can be arbitrarily large, output -1 instead.\nDemo input: ['5 4\\nabaca\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n3 4\\n4 5\\n', '6 6\\nxzyabc\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 3\\n5 4\\n4 3\\n6 4\\n', '10 14\\nxzyzyzyzqx\\n1 2\\n2 4\\n3 5\\n4 5\\n2 6\\n6 8\\n6 5\\n2 10\\n3 9\\n10 9\\n4 6\\n1 10\\n2 8\\n3 7\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n', '-1\\n', '4\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, the path with largest value is $1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 5$. The value is $3$ because the letter 'a' appears $3$ times."}]}}

Initially all the letters of the word are hidden.\n\nThe game consists of several turns. At each turn the participant tells a letter and the TV show host responds if there is such letter in the word or not. If there is such letter then the host reveals all such letters.

These sections are connected by a chain: the 1-st section is adjacent only to the 2-nd one, the 2-nd one \u2014 to the 1-st and the 3-rd ones, the 3-rd one \u2014 only to the 2-nd one. The transitions are possible only between the adjacent sections.\n\nThe spacecraft team consists of *n* aliens. Each of them is given a rank \u2014 an integer from 1 to *n*. The ranks of all astronauts are distinct. The rules established on the Saucer, state that an alien may move from section *a* to section *b* only if it is senior in rank to all aliens who are in the segments *a* and *b* (besides, the segments *a* and *b* are of course required to be adjacent). Any alien requires exactly 1 minute to make a move. Besides, safety regulations require that no more than one alien moved at the same minute along the ship.\n\nAlien *A* is senior in rank to alien *B*, if the number indicating rank *A*, is more than the corresponding number for *B*.\n\nAt the moment the whole saucer team is in the 3-rd segment.

Specifically, the square plane contains *n* bombs, the *i*-th bomb is at point with coordinates (*x**i*,<=*y**i*).

Also, let's mark the robot's current position as (*x*,<=*y*). In order to destroy all the bombs, the robot can perform three types of operations:\n 1.  Operation has format \"1 k dir\". To perform the operation robot have to move in direction *dir* *k* (*k*<=\u2265<=1) times. There are only 4 directions the robot can move in: \"R\", \"L\", \"U\", \"D\".

It is forbidden to move from point (*x*,<=*y*), if at least one point on the path (besides the destination point) contains a bomb. 1.  Operation has format \"2\".

Write a python script for the following problem: Alice and Bob decided to eat some fruit. In the kitchen they found a large bag of oranges and apples. Alice immediately took an orange for herself, Bob took an apple. To make the process of sharing the remaining fruit more fun, the friends decided to play a game. They put multiple cards and on each one they wrote a letter, either 'A', or the letter 'B'. Then they began to remove the cards one by one from left to right, every time they removed a card with the letter 'A', Alice gave Bob all the fruits she had at that moment and took out of the bag as many apples and as many oranges as she had before. Thus the number of oranges and apples Alice had, did not change. If the card had written letter 'B', then Bob did the same, that is, he gave Alice all the fruit that he had, and took from the bag the same set of fruit. After the last card way removed, all the fruit in the bag were over.\n\nYou know how many oranges and apples was in the bag at first. Your task is to find any sequence of cards that Alice and Bob could have played with.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers, *x*,<=*y* (1<=\u2264<=*x*,<=*y*<=\u2264<=1018,<=*xy*<=&gt;<=1) \u2014 the number of oranges and apples that were initially in the bag.. Output specification: Print any sequence of cards that would meet the problem conditions as a compressed string of characters 'A' and 'B.

For example, string AAABAABBB should be replaced by string 3A1B2A3B, but cannot be replaced by 2A1A1B2A3B or by 3AB2A3B. See the samples for clarifications of the output format. The string that you print should consist of at most 106 characters. It is guaranteed that if the answer exists, its compressed representation exists, consisting of at most 106 characters. If there are several possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them.\n\nIf the sequence of cards that meet the problem statement does not not exist, print a single word Impossible.\nDemo input: ['1 4\\n', '2 2\\n', '3 2\\n'], Demo output: ['3B\\n', 'Impossible\\n', '1A1B\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, if the row contained three cards with letter 'B', then Bob should give one apple to Alice three times. So, in the end of the game Alice has one orange and three apples, and Bob has one apple, in total it is one orange and four apples.\n\nIn second sample, there is no answer since one card is not enough for game to finish, and two cards will produce at least three apples or three oranges.\n\nIn the third sample, cards contain letters 'AB', so after removing the first card Bob has one orange and one apple, and after removal of second card Alice has two oranges and one apple.

Write a python script for the following problem: There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: \n -  alloc n \u2014 to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; \nThe memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.\n\nThe first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.\nInput specification: The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100;1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *t* \u2014 the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* \u2014 the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.. Output specification: Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession. Output lines should go in the same order in which the operations are processed. Successful procession of alloc operation should return integers, starting with 1, as the identifiers of the allocated blocks.\nDemo input: ['6 10\\nalloc 5\\nalloc 3\\nerase 1\\nalloc 6\\ndefragment\\nalloc 6\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n2\\nNULL\\n3\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Both of these strings are non-empty and consist of lowercase letters of English alphabet. The length of each string is not bigger than 105 characters.. Output specification: If there's no uncommon subsequence, print \"-1\". Otherwise print the length of the longest uncommon subsequence of *a* and *b*.\nDemo input: ['abcd\\ndefgh\\n', 'a\\na\\n'], Demo output: ['5\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: In the first example: you can choose \"defgh\" from string *b* as it is the longest subsequence of string *b* that doesn't appear as a subsequence of string *a*."}]}}

At this stage Vasya's ninja should get out of a deep canyon.\n\nThe canyon consists of two vertical parallel walls, their height is *n* meters. Let's imagine that we split these walls into 1 meter-long areas and number them with positive integers from 1 to *n* from bottom to top. Some areas are safe and the ninja can climb them. Others are spiky and ninja can't be there. Let's call such areas dangerous.\n\nInitially the ninja is on the lower area of the left wall. He can use each second to perform one of the following actions: \n -  climb one area up; -  climb one area down; -  jump to the opposite wall. That gets the ninja to the area that is exactly *k* meters higher than the area he jumped from.

It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.\n\nNow let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins.

If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too.

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the elements of array. \n\nThe third line contains integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs. Separate the numbers by spaces.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nDemo input: ['2\\n1 2\\n1\\n1\\n', '2\\n2 1\\n1\\n1\\n', '3\\n3 1 2\\n3\\n1 2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['1 2\\n', '2 1\\n', '6 6\\n']\nNote: In the first sample Vasya's approach will make one comparison (it starts with the 1-st element and immediately finds the required number), and Petya's approach makes two comparisons (first he compares with the 2-nd array element, doesn't find the search item and compares with the 1-st element).\n\nIn the second sample, on the contrary, Vasya's approach will need two comparisons (first with 1-st element, and then with the 2-nd), and Petya's approach will find the required value in one comparison (the first comparison with the 2-nd element)."}]}}

However, he doesn't remember at all the way the toys used to lie. Of course, Masha remembers it, but she can't talk yet and can only help Sasha by shouting happily when he arranges the toys in the way they used to lie. That means that Sasha will have to arrange the toys in every possible way until Masha recognizes the needed arrangement. The relative position of the piles and toys in every pile is irrelevant, that's why the two ways of arranging the toys are considered different if can be found two such toys that when arranged in the first way lie in one and the same pile and do not if arranged in the second way.

Language is a set of words, and word is a sequence of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nPeterson makes new language every morning. It is difficult task to store the whole language, so Peterson have invented new data structure for storing his languages which is called broom. Broom is rooted tree with edges marked with letters. Initially broom is represented by the only vertex\u00a0\u2014 the root of the broom. When Peterson wants to add new word to the language he stands at the root and processes the letters of new word one by one. Consider that Peterson stands at the vertex *u*. If there is an edge from *u* marked with current letter, Peterson goes through this edge. Otherwise Peterson adds new edge from *u* to the new vertex *v*, marks it with the current letter and goes through the new edge. Size of broom is the number of vertices in it.\n\nIn the evening after working day Peterson can't understand the language he made this morning. It is too difficult for bored Peterson and he tries to make it simpler. Simplification of the language is the process of erasing some letters from some words of this language. Formally, Peterson takes some positive integer *p* and erases *p*-th letter from all the words of this language having length at least *p*. Letters in words are indexed starting by 1. Peterson considers that simplification should change at least one word, i.e. there has to be at least one word of length at least *p*. Peterson tries to make his language as simple as possible, so he wants to choose *p* such that the size of the broom for his simplified language is as small as possible.\n\nPeterson is pretty annoyed with this task so he asks you for help.

However, Gerald knows that if he loses more than *k* characters, it will be very suspicious. \n\nFind the least number of distinct characters that can remain in the string after no more than *k* characters are deleted. You also have to find any possible way to delete the characters.\nInput specification: The first input data line contains a string whose length is equal to *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105). The string consists of lowercase Latin letters. The second line contains the number *k* (0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=105).. Output specification: Print on the first line the only number *m* \u2014 the least possible number of different characters that could remain in the given string after it loses no more than *k* characters.\n\nPrint on the second line the string that Gerald can get after some characters are lost. The string should have exactly *m* distinct characters. The final string should be the subsequence of the initial string. If Gerald can get several different strings with exactly *m* distinct characters, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['aaaaa\\n4\\n', 'abacaba\\n4\\n', 'abcdefgh\\n10\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\naaaaa\\n', '1\\naaaa\\n', '0\\n\\n']\nNote: In the first sample the string consists of five identical letters but you are only allowed to delete 4 of them so that there was at least one letter left. Thus, the right answer is 1 and any string consisting of characters \"a\" from 1 to 5 in length.\n\nIn the second sample you are allowed to delete 4 characters. You cannot delete all the characters, because the string has length equal to 7. However, you can delete all characters apart from \"a\" (as they are no more than four), which will result in the \"aaaa\" string.\n\nIn the third sample you are given a line whose length is equal to 8, and *k*\u2009=\u200910, so that the whole line can be deleted. The correct answer is 0 and an empty string."}]}}

Vasya's thoughts were hazy and so he couldn't remember the right bus' number quite right and got onto the bus with the number $n$.\n\nIn the bus, Vasya thought that he could get the order of the digits in the number of the bus wrong. Futhermore, he could \"see\" some digits several times, but the digits he saw were definitely in the real number of the bus.

If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.\n\nNikephoros and Polycarpus have played *n* rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body.

Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**m*, *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**m*, *a*1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items *B*<==<=(*b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**k*).\n\nDetermine the number of red spots on both players after they've played *n* rounds of the game.

For example, the following years are leap: 2000, 2004, but years 1900 and 2018 are not leap.\n\nIn this problem you are given *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=24) integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*, and you have to check if these integers could be durations in days of *n* consecutive months, according to Gregorian calendar. Note that these months could belong to several consecutive years. In other words, check if there is a month in some year, such that its duration is *a*1 days, duration of the next month is *a*2 days, and so on.\nInput specification: The first line contains single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=24) \u2014 the number of integers.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (28<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=31) \u2014 the numbers you are to check.. Output specification: If there are several consecutive months that fit the sequence, print \"YES\" (without quotes). Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\nYou can print each letter in arbitrary case (small or large).\nDemo input: ['4\\n31 31 30 31\\n', '2\\n30 30\\n', '5\\n29 31 30 31 30\\n', '3\\n31 28 30\\n', '3\\n31 31 28\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n\\n', 'No\\n\\n', 'Yes\\n\\n', 'No\\n\\n', 'Yes\\n\\n']\nNote: In the first example the integers can denote months July, August, September and October.\n\nIn the second example the answer is no, because there are no two consecutive months each having 30 days.\n\nIn the third example the months are: February (leap year) \u2014 March \u2014 April \u2013 May \u2014 June.\n\nIn the fourth example the number of days in the second month is 28, so this is February. March follows February and has 31 days, but not 30, so the answer is NO.\n\nIn the fifth example the months are: December \u2014 January \u2014 February (non-leap year)."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: After the contest in comparing numbers, Shapur's teacher found out that he is a real genius and that no one could possibly do the calculations faster than him even using a super computer!\n\nSome days before the contest, the teacher took a very simple-looking exam and all his *n* students took part in the exam. The teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation.\n\nUnfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.\n\nNow the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers.\n\nShapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: \n -  As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. -  As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include \"-\", \";\" and \"_\". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. -  The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600 -  My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. -  Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN -  You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong. Do this by writing \"WA\" for Wrong answer or \"ACC\" for a correct answer. -  I should remind you that none of the strings (initial strings or answers) are empty. -  Finally, do these as soon as possible. You have less than 2 hours to complete this.\nInput specification: The first three lines contain a string each. These are the initial strings. They consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\").

Your task is to find the number of connected components which are cycles.\n\nHere are some definitions of graph theory.\n\nAn undirected graph consists of two sets: set of nodes (called vertices) and set of edges. Each edge connects a pair of vertices. All edges are bidirectional (i.e. if a vertex $a$ is connected with a vertex $b$, a vertex $b$ is also connected with a vertex $a$). An edge can't connect vertex with itself, there is at most one edge between a pair of vertices.\n\nTwo vertices $u$ and $v$ belong to the same connected component if and only if there is at least one path along edges connecting $u$ and $v$.\n\nA connected component is a cycle if and only if its vertices can be reordered in such a way that:\n -  the first vertex is connected with the second vertex by an edge, -  the second vertex is connected with the third vertex by an edge, -  ... -  the last vertex is connected with the first vertex by an edge, -  all the described edges of a cycle are distinct. \nA cycle doesn't contain any other edges except described above.
