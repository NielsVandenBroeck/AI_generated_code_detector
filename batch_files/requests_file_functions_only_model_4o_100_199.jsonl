However, Vasya cannot turn square boards.\n\nVasya is required to construct a fence of length *l*, however, an arbitrary fence won't do. Vasya wants his fence to look beautiful.

Your task is to count the number of different beautiful fences of length *l*.\n\nTwo fences will be considered the same if the corresponding sequences of fence boards types and rotations are the same, otherwise the fences are different.

For example, during yesterday sitting the Berland Parliament approved as much as *n* laws (each law has been assigned a unique number from 1 to *n*). Today all these laws were put on the table of the President of Berland, G.W. Boosch, to be signed.\n\nThis time mr. Boosch plans to sign 2*k* laws. He decided to choose exactly two non-intersecting segments of integers from 1 to *n* of length *k* and sign all laws, whose numbers fall into these segments. More formally, mr. Boosch is going to choose two integers *a*, *b* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*k*<=+<=1,<=*b*<=-<=*a*<=\u2265<=*k*) and sign all laws with numbers lying in the segments [*a*;\u00a0*a*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] and [*b*;\u00a0*b*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] (borders are included).\n\nAs mr. Boosch chooses the laws to sign, he of course considers the public opinion. Allberland Public Opinion Study Centre (APOSC) conducted opinion polls among the citizens, processed the results into a report and gave it to the president. The report contains the absurdity value for each law, in the public opinion. As mr. Boosch is a real patriot, he is keen on signing the laws with the maximum total absurdity.

He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.\n\nOne day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.\nInput specification: There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number. It is guaranteed that the numbers are made from 0 and 1 only and that their length is same. The numbers may start with 0. The length of each number doesn't exceed 100..

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array.

Write a python script for the following problem: Let's define the permutation of length *n* as an array *p*<==<=[*p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n*] consisting of *n* distinct integers from range from 1 to *n*. We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value *p*1, value 2 into the value *p*2 and so on.\n\nKyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a permutation. A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle). The cyclic representation is a representation of *p* as a collection of cycles forming *p*. For example, permutation *p*<==<=[4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] has a cyclic representation that looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are swapped, and 5 remains in place. \n\nPermutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya defines the standard cyclic representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first. Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation of [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] is (421)(5)(63).\n\nNow, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For instance, [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] will become [4,<=2,<=1,<=5,<=6,<=3].\n\nKyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of length *n* that do not change in a list in lexicographic order. Unfortunately, his friend Tamaki Suoh lost this list. Kyoya wishes to reproduce the list and he needs your help. Given the integers *n* and *k*, print the permutation that was *k*-th on Kyoya's list.\nInput specification: The first line will contain two integers *n*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*min*{1018,<=*l*} where *l* is the length of the Kyoya's list)..

The first permutation on the list would be [1,\u20092,\u20093,\u20094], while the second permutation would be [1,\u20092,\u20094,\u20093]."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Vova is again playing some computer game, now an RPG. In the game Vova's character received a quest: to slay the fearsome monster called Modcrab.\n\nAfter two hours of playing the game Vova has tracked the monster and analyzed its tactics. The Modcrab has *h*2 health points and an attack power of *a*2. Knowing that, Vova has decided to buy a lot of strong healing potions and to prepare for battle.\n\nVova's character has *h*1 health points and an attack power of *a*1. Also he has a large supply of healing potions, each of which increases his current amount of health points by *c*1 when Vova drinks a potion. All potions are identical to each other. It is guaranteed that *c*1<=&gt;<=*a*2.\n\nThe battle consists of multiple phases. In the beginning of each phase, Vova can either attack the monster (thus reducing its health by *a*1) or drink a healing potion (it increases Vova's health by *c*1; Vova's health can exceed *h*1). Then, if the battle is not over yet, the Modcrab attacks Vova, reducing his health by *a*2. The battle ends when Vova's (or Modcrab's) health drops to 0 or lower. It is possible that the battle ends in a middle of a phase after Vova's attack.\n\nOf course, Vova wants to win the fight. But also he wants to do it as fast as possible.

Write a python script for the following problem: Merge sort is a well-known sorting algorithm. The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:\n 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=\u2264<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* \u2014 *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\nInput specification: The first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it..

For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards.\n\nAs before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8<=\u00d7<=8 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke.\n\nKalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client's requirements.\n\nIt goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything \u2014 for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's needs.

Write a python script for the following problem: It's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.\n\nRecently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.\n\nBeing defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.\n\nEach door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number *a*. The second part is either an integer number *b* or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer *c* and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.\n\n*c* is an integer written in base *a*, to open the door we should write it in base *b*. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!\n\nHere's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:\n\nRoman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.:\n-  I=1-  V=5-  X=10-  L=50-  C=100-  D=500-  M=1000\nSymbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1,<=000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.\n\nAlso in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\n\nHelp Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *a* and *b* (2<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=25). Only *b* may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer *c* in base *a* which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. \n\nIt is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0.

Write a python script for the following problem: There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: \n -  alloc n \u2014 to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; \nThe memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.\n\nThe first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.\nInput specification: The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100;1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *t* \u2014 the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* \u2014 the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.. Output specification: Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession. Output lines should go in the same order in which the operations are processed. Successful procession of alloc operation should return integers, starting with 1, as the identifiers of the allocated blocks.\nDemo input: ['6 10\\nalloc 5\\nalloc 3\\nerase 1\\nalloc 6\\ndefragment\\nalloc 6\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n2\\nNULL\\n3\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}
