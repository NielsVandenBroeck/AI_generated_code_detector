Write a python script for the following problem: This is an interactive problem. In the output section below you will see the information about flushing the output.\n\nOn Sunday Leha the hacker took Nura from the house where she lives and went with her to one of the most luxurious restaurants in Vi\u010dkopolis. Upon arrival, they left the car in a huge parking lot near the restaurant and hurried inside the building.\n\nIn the restaurant a polite waiter immediately brought the menu to Leha and Noora, consisting of *n* dishes. It is interesting that all dishes in the menu are numbered with integers from 1 to *n*. After a little thought, the girl ordered exactly *k* different dishes from available in the menu. To pass the waiting time while the chefs prepare ordered dishes, the girl invited the hacker to play a game that will help them get to know each other better.\n\nThe game itself is very simple: Noora wants Leha to guess any two dishes among all ordered. At the same time, she is ready to answer only one type of questions. Leha can say two numbers *x* and *y* (1<=\u2264<=*x*,<=*y*<=\u2264<=*n*). After that Noora chooses some dish *a* for the number *x* such that, at first, *a* is among the dishes Noora ordered (*x* can be equal to *a*), and, secondly, the value  is the minimum possible. By the same rules the girl chooses dish *b* for *y*. After that Noora says \u00abTAK\u00bb to Leha, if , and \u00abNIE\u00bb otherwise. However, the restaurant is preparing quickly, so Leha has enough time to ask no more than 60 questions. After that he should name numbers of any two dishes Noora ordered.\n\nHelp Leha to solve this problem!\nInput specification: There are two numbers *n* and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) in the single line of input denoting the number of dishes in the menu and the number of dishes Noora ordered.. Output specification: If you want to provide an answer, output a string of the form 2 *x* *y* (1<=\u2264<=*x*,<=*y*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*x*<=\u2260<=*y*), if you think the dishes *x* and *y* was among dishes ordered by Noora. After that, flush the output and terminate your program.\nDemo input: ['3 2\\nNIE\\nTAK\\nNIE\\nTAK\\nTAK\\nTAK\\n'], Demo output: ['1 1 2\\n1 2 1\\n1 1 3\\n1 3 1\\n1 2 3\\n1 3 2\\n2 2 3\\n']\nNote: There are three dishes in sample. Noora ordered dished numberes 2 and 3, which Leha should guess. If Noora receive requests for the first dish (*x*\u2009=\u20091), then she'll choose the second dish (*a*\u2009=\u20092) as the dish with the minimum value <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/e5a4a1705bc256e413564795cc8b70857f0ae44c.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>.

Two pairs are considered different, if they contain different substrings of string *s* or different subsequences of string *t*. Read the whole statement to understand the definition of different substrings and subsequences.\n\nThe length of string *s* is the number of characters in it. If we denote the length of the string *s* as |*s*|, we can write the string as *s*<==<=*s*1*s*2... *s*|*s*|.\n\nA substring of *s* is a non-empty string *x*<==<=*s*[*a*... *b*]<==<=*s**a**s**a*<=+<=1... *s**b* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=|*s*|).

Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language. \n\nTwo strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match. \n\nLet's look at the example: the word *abacabaca* is given. This word can be obtained in the following ways: , where the root of the word is overlined, and suffixes are marked by \"corners\". Thus, the set of possible suffixes for this word is {*aca*,<=*ba*,<=*ca*}.\nInput specification: The only line contains a string *s* (5<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=104) consisting of lowercase English letters.. Output specification: On the first line print integer *k* \u2014 a number of distinct possible suffixes. On the next *k* lines print suffixes. \n\nPrint suffixes in lexicographical (alphabetical) order.\nDemo input: ['abacabaca\\n', 'abaca\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\naca\\nba\\nca\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: The first test was analysed in the problem statement. \n\nIn the second example the length of the string equals 5. The length of the root equals 5, so no string can be used as a suffix."}]}}

And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts *k* days!\n\nWhen Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last *n* days. So now he has a sequence *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*, where *a**i* is the sleep time on the *i*-th day.\n\nThe number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider *k* consecutive days as a week. So there will be *n*<=-<=*k*<=+<=1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if *k*<==<=2, *n*<==<=3 and *a*<==<=[3,<=4,<=7], then the result is .\n\nYou should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integer numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105).\n\nThe second line contains *n* integer numbers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=105).. Output specification: Output average sleeping time over all weeks. \n\nThe answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10<=-<=6.

Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!).

Write a python script for the following problem: The heat during the last few days has been really intense. Scientists from all over the Berland study how the temperatures and weather change, and they claim that this summer is abnormally hot. But any scientific claim sounds a lot more reasonable if there are some numbers involved, so they have decided to actually calculate some value which would represent how high the temperatures are.\n\nMathematicians of Berland State University came up with a special heat intensity value. This value is calculated as follows:\n\nSuppose we want to analyze the segment of $n$ consecutive days. We have measured the temperatures during these $n$ days; the temperature during $i$-th day equals $a_i$.\n\nWe denote the average temperature of a segment of some consecutive days as the arithmetic mean of the temperature measures during this segment of days. So, if we want to analyze the average temperature from day $x$ to day $y$, we calculate it as $\\frac{\\sum \\limits_{i = x}^{y} a_i}{y - x + 1}$ (note that division is performed without any rounding). The heat intensity value is the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than $k$ consecutive days. For example, if analyzing the measures $[3, 4, 1, 2]$ and $k = 3$, we are interested in segments $[3, 4, 1]$, $[4, 1, 2]$ and $[3, 4, 1, 2]$ (we want to find the maximum value of average temperature over these segments).\n\nYou have been hired by Berland State University to write a program that would compute the heat intensity value of a given period of days.

In this case only apartment 4 is good. The maximum possible number could be, for example, if apartments with indices 1, 3 and 5 were inhabited. In this case all other apartments: 2, 4 and 6 are good."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes.

Then follow *k* lines, each of them contains two integers *dx**i* and *dy**i* (|*dx**i*|,<=|*dy**i*|<=\u2264<=109,<=|*dx*|<=+<=|*dy*|<=\u2265<=1)..

So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091). He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

By the arrival of the President of Berland these trees were decided to be changed so that their heights formed a beautiful sequence. This means that the heights of trees on ends (the 1st one and the *n*-th one) should be equal to each other, the heights of the 2-nd and the (*n*<=-<=1)-th tree must also be equal to each other, at that the height of the 2-nd tree should be larger than the height of the first tree by 1, and so on. In other words, the heights of the trees, standing at equal distance from the edge (of one end of the sequence) must be equal to each other, and with the increasing of the distance from the edge by 1 the tree height must also increase by 1. For example, the sequences \"2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2\" and \"1 2 3 2 1\" are beautiful, and '1 3 3 1\" and \"1 2 3 1\" are not. \n\nChanging the height of a tree is a very expensive operation, using advanced technologies invented by Berland scientists. In one operation you can choose any tree and change its height to any number, either increase or decrease.

The wires run along the floor from the wall (on the left) to the device (on the right).

To ensure a better life for the Mars citizens, their emperor decided to take tax from every tourist who visited the planet. Natasha is the inhabitant of Earth, therefore she had to pay the tax to enter the territory of Mars.\n\nThere are $n$ banknote denominations on Mars: the value of $i$-th banknote is $a_i$. Natasha has an infinite number of banknotes of each denomination.\n\nMartians have $k$ fingers on their hands, so they use a number system with base $k$. In addition, the Martians consider the digit $d$ (in the number system with base $k$) divine. Thus, if the last digit in Natasha's tax amount written in the number system with the base $k$ is $d$, the Martians will be happy.

Write a python script for the following problem: By 2312 there were *n* Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them.

In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated.

Moreover, Igor has some problems with the steering wheel, so he can make no more than two turns on his way to his office in bank.\n\nBankopolis looks like a grid of *n* rows and *m* columns. Igor should find a way from his home to the bank that has no more than two turns and doesn't contain cells with road works, or determine that it is impossible and he should work from home. A turn is a change in movement direction. Igor's car can only move to the left, to the right, upwards and downwards. Initially Igor can choose any direction. Igor is still sleepy, so you should help him.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of rows and the number of columns in the grid.\n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains *m* characters denoting the corresponding row of the grid. The following characters can occur: \n -  \".\" \u2014 an empty cell; -  \"*\" \u2014 a cell with road works; -  \"S\" \u2014 the cell where Igor's home is located; -  \"T\" \u2014 the cell where Igor's office is located. \nIt is guaranteed that \"S\" and \"T\" appear exactly once each.. Output specification: In the only line print \"YES\" if there is a path between Igor's home and Igor's office with no more than two turns, and \"NO\" otherwise.\nDemo input: ['5 5\\n..S..\\n****.\\nT....\\n****.\\n.....\\n', '5 5\\nS....\\n****.\\n.....\\n.****\\n..T..\\n'], Demo output: ['YES', 'NO']\nNote: The first sample is shown on the following picture:\n\nIn the second sample it is impossible to reach Igor's office using less that 4 turns, thus there exists no path using no more than 2 turns. The path using exactly 4 turns is shown on this picture:"}]}}

He's been working there for a long time and is satisfied with his job, as it allows him to eat out in the best restaurants and order the most expensive and exotic wood types there. \n\nThe content special agent has got an important task: to get the latest research by British scientists on the English Language. These developments are encoded and stored in a large safe. The Beaver's teeth are strong enough, so the authorities assured that upon arriving at the place the beaver won't have any problems with opening the safe.\n\nAnd he finishes his aspen sprig and leaves for this important task. Of course, the Beaver arrived at the location without any problems, but alas. He can't open the safe with his strong and big teeth. At this point, the Smart Beaver get a call from the headquarters and learns that opening the safe with the teeth is not necessary, as a reliable source has sent the following information: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. There also is a special hint, which can be used to open the safe. The hint is string *s* with the following structure:\n -  if *s**i* = \"?\", then the digit that goes *i*-th in the safe code can be anything (between 0 to 9, inclusively); -  if *s**i* is a digit (between 0 to 9, inclusively), then it means that there is digit *s**i* on position *i* in code; -  if the string contains letters from \"A\" to \"J\", then all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits and the positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits. -  The length of the safe code coincides with the length of the hint. \nFor example, hint \"?JGJ9\" has such matching safe code variants: \"51919\", \"55959\", \"12329\", \"93539\" and so on, and has wrong variants such as: \"56669\", \"00111\", \"03539\" and \"13666\".\n\nAfter receiving such information, the authorities change the plan and ask the special agents to work quietly and gently and not to try to open the safe by mechanical means, and try to find the password using the given hint.\n\nAt a special agent school the Smart Beaver was the fastest in his platoon finding codes for such safes, but now he is not in that shape: the years take their toll ...

One of these tasks is the following.\n\nA sequence of *l* integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**l* (1<=\u2264<=*b*1<=\u2264<=*b*2<=\u2264<=...<=\u2264<=*b**l*<=\u2264<=*n*) is called good if each number divides (without a remainder) by the next number in the sequence. More formally  for all *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*l*<=-<=1).\n\nGiven *n* and *k* find the number of good sequences of length *k*. As the answer can be rather large print it modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\nInput specification: The first line of input contains two space-separated integers *n*,<=*k*\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=2000).. Output specification: Output a single integer \u2014 the number of good sequences of length *k* modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\nDemo input: ['3 2\\n', '6 4\\n', '2 1\\n'], Demo output: ['5\\n', '39\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: In the first sample the good sequences are: [1,\u20091],\u2009[2,\u20092],\u2009[3,\u20093],\u2009[1,\u20092],\u2009[1,\u20093]."}]}}

Zhorik knows how each of these archives was transferred through the network: if an archive consists of *k* files of sizes *l*1,<=*l*2,<=...,<=*l**k* bytes, then the *i*-th file is split to one or more blocks *b**i*,<=1,<=*b**i*,<=2,<=...,<=*b**i*,<=*m**i* (here the total length of the blocks *b**i*,<=1<=+<=*b**i*,<=2<=+<=...<=+<=*b**i*,<=*m**i* is equal to the length of the file *l**i*), and after that all blocks are transferred through the network, maintaining the order of files in the archive.\n\nZhorik thinks that the two messages contain the same archive, because their total lengths are equal.

You will consider your performance good if you win at least *l* tours.\n\nIn fact, years of organizing contests proved to the organizers that transporting huge prizes is an issue for the participants. Alas, no one has ever invented a spell that would shrink the prizes... So, here's the solution: for some tours the winner gets a bag instead of a huge prize. Each bag is characterized by number *a**i* \u2014 the number of huge prizes that will fit into it.\n\nYou already know the subject of all tours, so you can estimate the probability *p**i* of winning the *i*-th tour. You cannot skip the tour under any circumstances.\n\nFind the probability that you will perform well on the contest and will be able to take all won prizes home (that is, that you will be able to fit all the huge prizes that you won into the bags that you either won or brought from home).\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *l*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200,<=0<=\u2264<=*l*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=200) \u2014 the number of tours, the minimum number of tours to win, and the number of prizes that you can fit in the bags brought from home, correspondingly.\n\nThe second line contains *n* space-separated integers, *p**i* (0<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the probability to win the *i*-th tour, in percents.\n\nThe third line contains *n* space-separated integers, *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=200) \u2014 the capacity of the bag that will be awarded to you for winning the *i*-th tour, or else -1, if the prize for the *i*-th tour is a huge prize and not a bag.. Output specification: Print a single real number \u2014 the answer to the problem. The answer will be accepted if the absolute or relative error does not exceed 10<=-<=6.\nDemo input: ['3 1 0\\n10 20 30\\n-1 -1 2\\n', '1 1 1\\n100\\n123\\n'], Demo output: ['0.300000000000\\n', '1.000000000000\\n']\nNote: In the first sample we need either win no tour or win the third one. If we win nothing we wouldn't perform well. So, we must to win the third tour. Other conditions will be satisfied in this case. Probability of wining the third tour is 0.3.\n\nIn the second sample we win the only tour with probability 1.0, and go back home with bag for it."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes.

So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091). He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Grisha come to a contest and faced the following problem.\n\nYou are given an array of size $n$, initially consisting of zeros. The elements of the array are enumerated from $1$ to $n$. You perform $q$ operations on the array. The $i$-th operation is described with three integers $l_i$, $r_i$ and $x_i$ ($1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$, $1 \\leq x_i \\leq n$) and means that you should add $x_i$ to each of the elements with indices $l_i, l_i + 1, \\ldots, r_i$. After all operations you should find the maximum in the array.\n\nGrisha is clever, so he solved the problem quickly.\n\nHowever something went wrong inside his head and now he thinks of the following question: \"consider we applied some subset of the operations to the array. What are the possible values of the maximum in the array?\"\n\nHelp Grisha, find all integers $y$ between $1$ and $n$ such that if you apply some subset (possibly empty) of the operations, then the maximum in the array becomes equal to $y$.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \\leq n, q \\leq 10^{4}$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array and the number of queries in the initial problem.\n\nThe following $q$ lines contain queries, one per line. The $i$-th of these lines contains three integers $l_i$, $r_i$ and $x_i$ ($1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$, $1 \\leq x_i \\leq n$), denoting a query of adding $x_i$ to the segment from $l_i$-th to $r_i$-th elements of the array, inclusive.. Output specification: In the first line print the only integer $k$, denoting the number of integers from $1$ to $n$, inclusive, that can be equal to the maximum in the array after applying some subset (possibly empty) of the given operations.\n\nIn the next line print these $k$ integers from $1$ to $n$\u00a0\u2014 the possible values of the maximum.

If you consider the subset only of the first query, the maximum is equal to $1$. If you take only the second query, the maximum equals to $2$. If you take the first two queries, the maximum becomes $3$. If you take only the fourth query, the maximum becomes $4$. If you take the fourth query and something more, the maximum becomes greater that $n$, so you shouldn't print it.\n\nIn the second example you can take the first query to obtain $1$. You can take only the second query to obtain $2$. You can take all queries to obtain $3$.\n\nIn the third example you can obtain the following maximums:\n -  You can achieve the maximim of $2$ by using queries: $(1)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $3$ by using queries: $(2)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $5$ by using queries: $(1, 2)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $6$ by using queries: $(3)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $8$ by using queries: $(1, 3)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $9$ by using queries: $(2, 3)$."}]}}

The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) portal connects cell *i* and cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*), and one can travel from cell *i* to cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) using the *i*-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) to cell *i* using the *i*-th portal. It is easy to see that because of condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* one can't leave the Line World using portals.\n\nCurrently, I am standing at cell 1, and I want to go to cell *t*.

Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.\n\nFor example:\n -  the following words have typos: \"hellno\", \"hackcerrs\" and \"backtothefutttture\"; -  the following words don't have typos: \"helllllooooo\", \"tobeornottobe\" and \"oooooo\". \nWhen Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.\n\nImplement this feature of Beroffice editor. Consider the following letters as the only vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'. All the other letters are consonants in this problem.\nInput specification: The only line contains a non-empty word consisting of small English letters. The length of the word is between 1 and 3000 letters.. Output specification: Print the given word without any changes if there are no typos.\n\nIf there is at least one typo in the word, insert the minimum number of spaces into the word so that each of the resulting words doesn't have any typos. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['hellno\\n', 'abacaba\\n', 'asdfasdf\\n'], Demo output: ['hell no \\n', 'abacaba \\n', 'asd fasd f \\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

If we split string *a* into two halves of the same size *a*1 and *a*2, and string *b* into two halves of the same size *b*1 and *b*2, then one of the following is correct:   *a*1 is equivalent to *b*1, and *a*2 is equivalent to *b*2 1.  *a*1 is equivalent to *b*2, and *a*2 is equivalent to *b*1 \nAs a home task, the teacher gave two strings to his students and asked to determine if they are equivalent.\n\nGerald has already completed this home task. Now it's your turn!\nInput specification: The first two lines of the input contain two strings given by the teacher. Each of them has the length from 1 to 200<=000 and consists of lowercase English letters. The strings have the same length.. Output specification: Print \"YES\" (without the quotes), if these two strings are equivalent, and \"NO\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\nDemo input: ['aaba\\nabaa\\n', 'aabb\\nabab\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: In the first sample you should split the first string into strings \"aa\" and \"ba\", the second one \u2014 into strings \"ab\" and \"aa\". \"aa\" is equivalent to \"aa\"; \"ab\" is equivalent to \"ba\" as \"ab\" = \"a\" + \"b\", \"ba\" = \"b\" + \"a\".\n\nIn the second sample the first string can be splitted into strings \"aa\" and \"bb\", that are equivalent only to themselves. That's why string \"aabb\" is equivalent only to itself and to string \"bbaa\"."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here.

The body can be considered as a material point with coordinates (0; 0; 0). Vasya had only to answer whether it is in equilibrium. \"Piece of cake\" \u2014 thought Vasya, we need only to check if the sum of all vectors is equal to 0. So, Vasya began to solve the problem. But later it turned out that there can be lots and lots of these forces, and Vasya can not cope without your help. Help him. Write a program that determines whether a body is idle or is moving by the given vectors of forces.\nInput specification: The first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), then follow *n* lines containing three integers each: the *x**i* coordinate, the *y**i* coordinate and the *z**i* coordinate of the force vector, applied to the body (<=-<=100<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*,<=*z**i*<=\u2264<=100)..

Initially first joystick is charged at *a*1 percent and second one is charged at *a*2 percent. You can connect charger to a joystick only at the beginning of each minute. In one minute joystick either discharges by 2 percent (if not connected to a charger) or charges by 1 percent (if connected to a charger).\n\nGame continues while both joysticks have a positive charge. Hence, if at the beginning of minute some joystick is charged by 1 percent, it has to be connected to a charger, otherwise the game stops.

Write a python script for the following problem: There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations: \n -  alloc n \u2014 to allocate *n* bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier *x*; -  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier *x*; -  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; \nThe memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of *m* bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the *m*-th.\n\nThe first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of *n* successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.\n\nThe second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.\n\nThe last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.\n\nIn the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.\n\nYou are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all the failed erase commands.\nInput specification: The first line of the input data contains two positive integers *t* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100;1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), where *t* \u2014 the amount of operations given to the memory manager for processing, and *m* \u2014 the available memory size in bytes. Then there follow *t* lines where the operations themselves are given. The first operation is alloc n (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is an integer. The second one is erase x, where *x* is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token. The third operation is defragment.. Output specification: Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the result of alloc operation procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a result of failed erase operation procession. Output lines should go in the same order in which the operations are processed.

Of course, the round can also have problems with other complexities.\n\nGeorge has a poor imagination.

Can you help him?\nInput specification: The first line contains five integers *n*,<=*m*,<=*L*,<=*s*,<=*t* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000,<=<=1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=10<=000,<=<=1<=\u2264<=*L*<=\u2264<=109,<=<=0<=\u2264<=*s*,<=*t*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1,<=<=*s*<=\u2260<=*t*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices, number of edges, the desired length of shortest path, starting vertex and ending vertex respectively.\n\nThen, *m* lines describing the edges of the graph follow. *i*-th of them contains three integers, *u**i*,<=*v**i*,<=*w**i* (0<=\u2264<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1,<=<=*u**i*<=\u2260<=*v**i*,<=<=0<=\u2264<=*w**i*<=\u2264<=109). *u**i* and *v**i* denote the endpoints of the edge and *w**i* denotes its weight. If *w**i* is equal to 0 then the weight of the corresponding edge was erased.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.. Output specification: Print \"NO\" (without quotes) in the only line if it's not possible to assign the weights in a required way.\n\nOtherwise, print \"YES\" in the first line. Next *m* lines should contain the edges of the resulting graph, with weights assigned to edges which weights were erased. *i*-th of them should contain three integers *u**i*, *v**i* and *w**i*, denoting an edge between vertices *u**i* and *v**i* of weight *w**i*. The edges of the new graph must coincide with the ones in the graph from the input. The weights that were not erased must remain unchanged whereas the new weights can be any positive integer not exceeding 1018. \n\nThe order of the edges in the output doesn't matter. The length of the shortest path between *s* and *t* must be equal to *L*.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['5 5 13 0 4\\n0 1 5\\n2 1 2\\n3 2 3\\n1 4 0\\n4 3 4\\n', '2 1 123456789 0 1\\n0 1 0\\n', '2 1 999999999 1 0\\n0 1 1000000000\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n0 1 5\\n2 1 2\\n3 2 3\\n1 4 8\\n4 3 4\\n', 'YES\\n0 1 123456789\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: Here's how the graph in the first sample case looks like :\n\nIn the first sample case, there is only one missing edge weight. Placing the weight of 8 gives a shortest path from 0 to 4 of length 13.\n\nIn the second sample case, there is only a single edge. Clearly, the only way is to replace the missing weight with 123456789.\n\nIn the last sample case, there is no weights to assign but the length of the shortest path doesn't match the required value, so the answer is \"NO\"."}]}}

These data centers provide storage for client data (you can figure out that client data is really big!).\n\nMain feature of services offered by BigData Inc. is the access availability guarantee even under the circumstances of any data center having an outage. Such a guarantee is ensured by using the two-way replication. Two-way replication is such an approach for data storage that any piece of data is represented by two identical copies that are stored in two different data centers.\n\nFor each of *m* company clients, let us denote indices of two different data centers storing this client data as *c**i*,<=1 and *c**i*,<=2.\n\nIn order to keep data centers operational and safe, the software running on data center computers is being updated regularly. Release cycle of BigData Inc. is one day meaning that the new version of software is being deployed to the data center computers each day.\n\nData center software update is a non-trivial long process, that is why there is a special hour-long time frame that is dedicated for data center maintenance. During the maintenance period, data center computers are installing software updates, and thus they may be unavailable. Consider the day to be exactly *h* hours long. For each data center there is an integer *u**j* (0<=\u2264<=*u**j*<=\u2264<=*h*<=-<=1) defining the index of an hour of day, such that during this hour data center *j* is unavailable due to maintenance.\n\nSumming up everything above, the condition *u**c**i*,<=1<=\u2260<=*u**c**i*,<=2 should hold for each client, or otherwise his data may be unaccessible while data centers that store it are under maintenance.\n\nDue to occasional timezone change in different cities all over the world, the maintenance time in some of the data centers may change by one hour sometimes. Company should be prepared for such situation, that is why they decided to conduct an experiment, choosing some non-empty subset of data centers, and shifting the maintenance time for them by an hour later (i.e. if *u**j*<==<=*h*<=-<=1, then the new maintenance hour would become 0, otherwise it would become *u**j*<=+<=1). Nonetheless, such an experiment should not break the accessibility guarantees, meaning that data of any client should be still available during any hour of a day after the data center maintenance times are changed.\n\nSuch an experiment would provide useful insights, but changing update time is quite an expensive procedure, that is why the company asked you to find out the minimum number of data centers that have to be included in an experiment in order to keep the data accessibility guarantees.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains three integers *n*, *m* and *h* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100<=000, 2<=\u2264<=*h*<=\u2264<=100<=000), the number of company data centers, number of clients and the day length of day measured in hours. \n\nThe second line of input contains *n* integers *u*1,<=*u*2,<=...,<=*u**n* (0<=\u2264<=*u**j*<=&lt;<=*h*), *j*-th of these numbers is an index of a maintenance hour for data center *j*. \n\nEach of the next *m* lines contains two integers *c**i*,<=1 and *c**i*,<=2 (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*,<=1,<=*c**i*,<=2<=\u2264<=*n*, *c**i*,<=1<=\u2260<=*c**i*,<=2), defining the data center indices containing the data of client *i*.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given maintenance schedule allows each client to access at least one copy of his data at any moment of day.. Output specification: In the first line print the minimum possible number of data centers *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*) that have to be included in an experiment in order to keep the data available for any client.\n\nIn the second line print *k* distinct integers *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**k* (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=*n*), the indices of data centers whose maintenance time will be shifted by one hour later. Data center indices may be printed in any order.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, it is allowed to print any of them.

Naturally, Dima, as all other men who have girlfriends, does everything wrong.\n\nInna and Dima are now in one room. Inna tells Dima off for everything he does in her presence. After Inna tells him off for something, she goes to another room, walks there in circles muttering about how useless her sweetheart is.

It continues until Dima is through with his tasks.\n\nOverall, Dima has *n* tasks to do, each task has a unique number from 1 to *n*. Dima loves order, so he does tasks consecutively, starting from some task. For example, if Dima has 6 tasks to do in total, then, if he starts from the 5-th task, the order is like that: first Dima does the 5-th task, then the 6-th one, then the 1-st one, then the 2-nd one, then the 3-rd one, then the 4-th one.\n\nInna tells Dima off (only lovingly and appropriately!) so often and systematically that he's very well learned the power with which she tells him off for each task.

A bipartite graph is a graph, whose vertices can be partitioned into 2 sets in such a way, that for each edge (*u*,<=*v*) that belongs to the graph, *u* and *v* belong to different sets. You can find more formal definitions of a tree and a bipartite graph in the notes section below.\n\nDr. Evil gave Mahmoud and Ehab a tree consisting of *n* nodes and asked them to add edges to it in such a way, that the graph is still bipartite. Besides, after adding these edges the graph should be simple (doesn't contain loops or multiple edges). What is the maximum number of edges they can add?\n\nA loop is an edge, which connects a node with itself. Graph doesn't contain multiple edges when for each pair of nodes there is no more than one edge between them. A cycle and a loop aren't the same .\nInput specification: The first line of input contains an integer *n*\u00a0\u2014 the number of nodes in the tree (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105).\n\nThe next *n*<=-<=1 lines contain integers *u* and *v* (1<=\u2264<=*u*,<=*v*<=\u2264<=*n*, *u*<=\u2260<=*v*)\u00a0\u2014 the description of the edges of the tree.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.. Output specification: Output one integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum number of edges that Mahmoud and Ehab can add to the tree while fulfilling the conditions.\nDemo input: ['3\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n', '5\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 4\\n4 5\\n'], Demo output: ['0\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: Tree definition: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory))\n\nBipartite graph definition: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph)\n\nIn the first test case the only edge that can be added in such a way, that graph won't contain loops or multiple edges is (2,\u20093), but adding this edge will make the graph non-bipartite so the answer is 0.\n\nIn the second test case Mahmoud and Ehab can add edges (1,\u20094) and (2,\u20095)."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Arcady is a copywriter. His today's task is to type up an already well-designed story using his favorite text editor.\n\nArcady types words, punctuation signs and spaces one after another. Each letter and each sign (including line feed) requires one keyboard click in order to be printed. Moreover, when Arcady has a non-empty prefix of some word on the screen, the editor proposes a possible autocompletion for this word, more precisely one of the already printed words such that its prefix matches the currently printed prefix if this word is unique. For example, if Arcady has already printed \u00abcodeforces\u00bb, \u00abcoding\u00bb and \u00abcodeforces\u00bb once again, then there will be no autocompletion attempt for \u00abcod\u00bb, but if he proceeds with \u00abcode\u00bb, the editor will propose \u00abcodeforces\u00bb.\n\nWith a single click Arcady can follow the editor's proposal, i.e. to transform the current prefix to it. Note that no additional symbols are printed after the autocompletion (no spaces, line feeds, etc). What is the minimum number of keyboard clicks Arcady has to perform to print the entire text, if he is not allowed to move the cursor or erase the already printed symbols?\n\nA word here is a contiguous sequence of latin letters bordered by spaces, punctuation signs and line/text beginnings/ends.

Pairs of friends are deduced in the following way. Let's assume that user *A* sent user *B* a message at time *t*1, and user *B* sent user *A* a message at time *t*2. If 0<=&lt;<=*t*2<=-<=*t*1<=\u2264<=*d*, then user *B*'s message was an answer to user *A*'s one.

Write a python script for the following problem: By 2312 there were *n* Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*).. Output specification: Print *m* lines \u2014 the results of executing requests in the above given format. The requests should be processed in the order, in which they are given in the input.

Write a python script for the following problem: Given an *n*<=\u00d7<=*n* table *T* consisting of lowercase English letters. We'll consider some string *s* good if the table contains a correct path corresponding to the given string. In other words, good strings are all strings we can obtain by moving from the left upper cell of the table only to the right and down. Here's the formal definition of correct paths:\n\nConsider rows of the table are numbered from 1 to *n* from top to bottom, and columns of the table are numbered from 1 to *n* from left to the right. Cell (*r*,<=*c*) is a cell of table *T* on the *r*-th row and in the *c*-th column. This cell corresponds to letter *T**r*,<=*c*.\n\nA path of length *k* is a sequence of table cells [(*r*1,<=*c*1),<=(*r*2,<=*c*2),<=...,<=(*r**k*,<=*c**k*)]. The following paths are correct: \n 1.

Then the players take turns to add a letter to the end of the string. After each move (adding a new letter) the resulting string must be good. The game ends after 2*n*<=-<=1 turns. A player wins by the following scenario: \n 1.  If the resulting string has strictly more letters \"a\" than letters \"b\", then the first player wins; 1.  If the resulting string has strictly more letters \"b\" than letters \"a\", then the second player wins; 1.  If the resulting string has the same number of letters \"a\" and \"b\", then the players end the game with a draw. \nYour task is to determine the result of the game provided that both players played optimally well.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single number *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=20).\n\nNext *n* lines contain *n* lowercase English letters each \u2014 table *T*..

Then the second player can add b or c and the game will end with strings abd or acd, correspondingly. In the first case it will be a draw (the string has one a and one b), in the second case the first player wins.

Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...\"\n\nMore formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of *n* grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:\n -  *m* grains are brought to the barn. If *m* grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account). -  Sparrows come and eat grain.

The barn becomes full again. -  At the end of the third day three sparrows come and eat grain. 5\u2009-\u20093\u2009=\u20092 grains remain. -  At the beginning of the fourth day grain is brought again. 2\u2009+\u20092\u2009=\u20094 grains remain. -  At the end of the fourth day four sparrows come and eat grain. 4\u2009-\u20094\u2009=\u20090 grains remain.

Please note that the way other solders are positioned does not matter, including the case when there are several soldiers whose height is maximum or minimum. Only the heights of the first and the last soldier are important.\n\nFor example, the general considers the sequence of heights (4, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1) correct and the sequence (4, 3, 1, 2, 2) wrong.\n\nWithin one second the colonel can swap any two neighboring soldiers.

For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\n\nVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads \u2014 major and minor.\n\nLet's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes *X*, *Y* and *Z*. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between *X* and *Y* equals 4 semitones and the distance between *Y* and *Z* is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between *X* and *Z*, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.\n\nA minor triad is different in that the distance between *X* and *Y* should be 3 semitones and between *Y* and *Z* \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nFor example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nHelp Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\nInput specification: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.. Output specification: Print \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor.

Petya wanted to create a maximally simple language that would be enough to chat with friends, that's why all the language's grammar can be described with the following set of rules:\n-  There are three parts of speech: the adjective, the noun, the verb. Each word in his language is an adjective, noun or verb. -  There are two genders: masculine and feminine. Each word in his language has gender either masculine or feminine. -  Masculine adjectives end with -lios, and feminine adjectives end with -liala. -  Masculine nouns end with -etr, and feminime nouns end with -etra. -  Masculine verbs end with -initis, and feminime verbs end with -inites. -  Thus, each word in the Petya's language has one of the six endings, given above. There are no other endings in Petya's language. -  It is accepted that the whole word consists of an ending. That is, words \"lios\", \"liala\", \"etr\" and so on belong to the Petya's language. -  There aren't any punctuation marks, grammatical tenses, singular/plural forms or other language complications. -  A sentence is either exactly one valid language word or exactly one statement. \nStatement is any sequence of the Petya's language, that satisfy both conditions:\n-  Words in statement follow in the following order (from the left to the right): zero or more adjectives followed by exactly one noun followed by zero or more verbs. -  All words in the statement should have the same gender.\nAfter Petya's friend Vasya wrote instant messenger (an instant messaging program) that supported the Petya's language, Petya wanted to add spelling and grammar checking to the program. As Vasya was in the country and Petya didn't feel like waiting, he asked you to help him with this problem.

Formally: we number all the planets from $1$ to $n$. $1$ is Earth, $n$ is Mars. Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt.

Write a python script for the following problem: Sasha is taking part in a programming competition. In one of the problems she should check if some rooted trees are isomorphic or not. She has never seen this problem before, but, being an experienced participant, she guessed that she should match trees to some sequences and then compare these sequences instead of trees. Sasha wants to match each tree with a sequence *a*0,<=*a*1,<=...,<=*a**h*, where *h* is the height of the tree, and *a**i* equals to the number of vertices that are at distance of *i* edges from root. \n\nUnfortunately, this time Sasha's intuition was wrong, and there could be several trees matching the same sequence. To show it, you need to write a program that, given the sequence *a**i*, builds two non-isomorphic rooted trees that match that sequence, or determines that there is only one such tree.\n\nTwo rooted trees are isomorphic, if you can reenumerate the vertices of the first one in such a way, that the index of the root becomes equal the index of the root of the second tree, and these two trees become equal.\n\nThe height of a rooted tree is the maximum number of edges on a path from the root to any other vertex.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *h* (2<=\u2264<=*h*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the height of the tree.\n\nThe second line contains *h*<=+<=1 integers\u00a0\u2014 the sequence *a*0,<=*a*1,<=...,<=*a**h* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105).

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the elements of array. \n\nThe third line contains integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs. Separate the numbers by spaces.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nDemo input: ['2\\n1 2\\n1\\n1\\n', '2\\n2 1\\n1\\n1\\n', '3\\n3 1 2\\n3\\n1 2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['1 2\\n', '2 1\\n', '6 6\\n']\nNote: In the first sample Vasya's approach will make one comparison (it starts with the 1-st element and immediately finds the required number), and Petya's approach makes two comparisons (first he compares with the 2-nd array element, doesn't find the search item and compares with the 1-st element).\n\nIn the second sample, on the contrary, Vasya's approach will need two comparisons (first with 1-st element, and then with the 2-nd), and Petya's approach will find the required value in one comparison (the first comparison with the 2-nd element)."}]}}

He arranges them in *a* equal rows, each row has *b* pebbles (*a*<=&gt;<=1). Note that the Beaver must use all the pebbles he has, i. e. *n*<==<=*a*\u00b7*b*.\n\nOnce the Smart Beaver has arranged the pebbles, he takes back any of the resulting rows (that is, *b* pebbles) and discards all other pebbles. Then he arranges all his pebbles again (possibly choosing other values of *a* and *b*) and takes back one row, and so on. The game continues until at some point the Beaver ends up with exactly one pebble. \n\nThe game process can be represented as a finite sequence of integers *c*1,<=...,<=*c**k*, where: \n -  *c*1<==<=*n* -  *c**i*<=+<=1 is the number of pebbles that the Beaver ends up with after the *i*-th move, that is, the number of pebbles in a row after some arrangement of *c**i* pebbles (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*k*). Note that *c**i*<=&gt;<=*c**i*<=+<=1. -  *c**k*<==<=1 \nThe result of the game is the sum of numbers *c**i*. You are given *n*. Find the maximum possible result of the game.\nInput specification: The single line of the input contains a single integer *n* \u2014 the initial number of pebbles the Smart Beaver has.\n\nThe input limitations for getting 30 points are: \n -  2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50 \nThe input limitations for getting 100 points are: \n -  2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=109. Output specification: Print a single number \u2014 the maximum possible result of the game.\nDemo input: ['10\\n', '8\\n'], Demo output: ['16\\n', '15\\n']\nNote: Consider the first example (*c*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>\u2009=\u200910). The possible options for the game development are:\n -  Arrange the pebbles in 10 rows, one pebble per row. Then *c*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>\u2009=\u20091, and the game ends after the first move with the result of 11. -  Arrange the pebbles in 5 rows, two pebbles per row. Then *c*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>\u2009=\u20092, and the game continues. During the second move we have two pebbles which can be arranged in a unique way (remember that you are not allowed to put all the pebbles in the same row!) \u2014 2 rows, one pebble per row. *c*<sub class=\"lower-index\">3</sub>\u2009=\u20091, and the game ends with the result of 13. -  Finally, arrange the pebbles in two rows, five pebbles per row. The same logic leads us to *c*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>\u2009=\u20095,\u2009*c*<sub class=\"lower-index\">3</sub>\u2009=\u20091, and the game ends with the result of 16 \u2014 the maximum possible result."}]}}

The game is played by two persons: operator and player. Operator takes three similar opaque shells and places a ball beneath one of them. Then he shuffles the shells by swapping some pairs and the player has to guess the current position of the ball.\n\nBomboslav noticed that guys are not very inventive, so the operator always swaps the left shell with the middle one during odd moves (first, third, fifth, etc.) and always swaps the middle shell with the right one during even moves (second, fourth, etc.).\n\nLet's number shells from 0 to 2 from left to right. Thus the left shell is assigned number 0, the middle shell is 1 and the right shell is 2. Bomboslav has missed the moment when the ball was placed beneath the shell, but he knows that exactly *n* movements were made by the operator and the ball was under shell *x* at the end.

The ball is still under the left shell. 1.  During the third move operator swapped the left shell and the middle shell again. The ball is again in the middle. 1.

In one of the articles it has been hypothesized that, whatever the sequence of numbers we have, in some position, this sequence is found among the digits of number \u03c0. Thus, if you take, for example, the epic novel \"War and Peace\" of famous Russian author Leo Tolstoy, and encode it with numbers, then we will find the novel among the characters of number \u03c0.\n\nVasily was absolutely delighted with this, because it means that all the books, songs and programs have already been written and encoded in the digits of \u03c0. Vasily is, of course, a bit wary that this is only a hypothesis and it hasn't been proved, so he decided to check it out.\n\nTo do this, Vasily downloaded from the Internet the archive with the sequence of digits of number \u03c0, starting with a certain position, and began to check the different strings of digits on the presence in the downloaded archive. Vasily quickly found short strings of digits, but each time he took a longer string, it turned out that it is not in the archive. Vasily came up with a definition that a string of length *d* is a half-occurrence if it contains a substring of length of at least , which occurs in the archive.\n\nTo complete the investigation, Vasily took 2 large numbers *x*,<=*y* (*x*<=\u2264<=*y*) with the same number of digits and now he wants to find the number of numbers in the interval from *x* to *y*, which are half-occurrences in the archive.

Write a python script for the following problem: In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.\n\nThere are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.\n\nOfficer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:\n -  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$; -  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. \nFor example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\n\nThe structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.\n\nFormally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.\n\nBerland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.\n\nSuppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ \u2014 one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.\n\nLet's look at the following example:\n\nIf officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.\n\nIf officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.\n\nTo answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.\n\nYou should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i &lt; i$), where $p_i$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $i$. The commander has index $1$ and doesn't have any superiors.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query is given as a pair ($u_i, k_i$) ($1 \\le u_i, k_i \\le n$), where $u_i$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $k_i$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence.. Output specification: Print $q$ numbers, where the $i$-th number is the officer at the position $k_i$ in the list which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if it starts spreading from officer $u_i$. Print \"-1\" if the number of officers which receive the command is less than $k_i$.\n\nYou should process queries independently. They do not affect each other.\nDemo input: ['9 6\\n1 1 1 3 5 3 5 7\\n3 1\\n1 5\\n3 4\\n7 3\\n1 8\\n1 9\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n6\\n8\\n-1\\n9\\n4\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

People wanted to meet people who live in other cells.\n\nSo, user tncks0121 has made a transportation system to move between these cells, to celebrate the New Year. First, he thought of *n*<=-<=1 positive integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1. For every integer *i* where 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1 the condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* holds. Next, he made *n*<=-<=1 portals, numbered by integers from 1 to *n*<=-<=1. The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) portal connects cell *i* and cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*), and one can travel from cell *i* to cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) using the *i*-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) to cell *i* using the *i*-th portal. It is easy to see that because of condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* one can't leave the Line World using portals.\n\nCurrently, I am standing at cell 1, and I want to go to cell *t*. However, I don't know whether it is possible to go there.

The boulevard consists of *n* tiles that are lain in a row and are numbered from 1 to *n* from right to left. The opposition should start walking on the tile number 1 and the finish on the tile number *n*. During the walk it is allowed to move from right to left between adjacent tiles in a row, and jump over a tile. More formally, if you are standing on the tile number *i* (*i*<=&lt;<=*n*<=-<=1), you can reach the tiles number *i*<=+<=1 or the tile number *i*<=+<=2 from it (if you stand on the tile number *n*<=-<=1, you can only reach tile number *n*). We can assume that all the opposition movements occur instantaneously.\n\nIn order to thwart an opposition rally, the Berland bloody regime organized the rain. The tiles on the boulevard are of poor quality and they are rapidly destroyed in the rain. We know that the *i*-th tile is destroyed after *a**i* days of rain (on day *a**i* tile isn't destroyed yet, and on day *a**i*<=+<=1 it is already destroyed). Of course, no one is allowed to walk on the destroyed tiles! So the walk of the opposition is considered thwarted, if either the tile number 1 is broken, or the tile number *n* is broken, or it is impossible to reach the tile number *n* from the tile number 1 if we can walk on undestroyed tiles.\n\nThe opposition wants to gather more supporters for their walk. Therefore, the more time they have to pack, the better.

A field is represented by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*) \u2014 the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:\n -  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically. -  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally. -  A king moves one field in any direction \u2014 horizontally, vertically or diagonally. \nPetya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2)? At that, we assume that there are no more pieces besides this one on the board.

He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.\n\nOne day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.\nInput specification: There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number. It is guaranteed that the numbers are made from 0 and 1 only and that their length is same. The numbers may start with 0. The length of each number doesn't exceed 100..

Write a python script for the following problem: Manao works on a sports TV. He's spent much time watching the football games of some country. After a while he began to notice different patterns. For example, each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform and guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well. For each team the color of the home and guest uniform is different.\n\nThere are *n* teams taking part in the national championship. The championship consists of *n*\u00b7(*n*<=-<=1) games: each team invites each other team to its stadium.

Write a python script for the following problem: Limak is a little polar bear. Polar bears hate long strings and thus they like to compress them. You should also know that Limak is so young that he knows only first six letters of the English alphabet: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' and 'f'.\n\nYou are given a set of *q* possible operations. Limak can perform them in any order, any operation may be applied any number of times. The *i*-th operation is described by a string *a**i* of length two and a string *b**i* of length one. No two of *q* possible operations have the same string *a**i*.\n\nWhen Limak has a string *s* he can perform the *i*-th operation on *s* if the first two letters of *s* match a two-letter string *a**i*. Performing the *i*-th operation removes first two letters of *s* and inserts there a string *b**i*. See the notes section for further clarification.\n\nYou may note that performing an operation decreases the length of a string *s* exactly by 1. Also, for some sets of operations there may be a string that cannot be compressed any further, because the first two letters don't match any *a**i*.\n\nLimak wants to start with a string of length *n* and perform *n*<=-<=1 operations to finally get a one-letter string \"a\". In how many ways can he choose the starting string to be able to get \"a\"? Remember that Limak can use only letters he knows.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *q* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=6, 1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=36)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the initial string and the number of available operations.\n\nThe next *q* lines describe the possible operations.

There are 4 such strings: \"abb\", \"cab\", \"cca\", \"eea\". The first one Limak can compress using operation 1 two times (changing \"ab\" to a single \"a\"). The first operation would change \"abb\" to \"ab\" and the second operation would change \"ab\" to \"a\".\n\nOther three strings may be compressed as follows: \n -  \"cab\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ab\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"a\" -  \"cca\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ca\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"a\" -  \"eea\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ca\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"a\" \nIn the second sample, the only correct initial string is \"eb\" because it can be immediately compressed to \"a\"."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Developers often face with regular expression patterns. A pattern is usually defined as a string consisting of characters and metacharacters that sets the rules for your search. These patterns are most often used to check whether a particular string meets the certain rules.\n\nIn this task, a pattern will be a string consisting of small English letters and question marks ('?'). The question mark in the pattern is a metacharacter that denotes an arbitrary small letter of the English alphabet. We will assume that a string matches the pattern if we can transform the string into the pattern by replacing the question marks by the appropriate characters. For example, string aba matches patterns: ???, ??a, a?a, aba.\n\nProgrammers that work for the R1 company love puzzling each other (and themselves) with riddles. One of them is as follows: you are given *n* patterns of the same length, you need to find a pattern that contains as few question marks as possible, and intersects with each of the given patterns. Two patterns intersect if there is a string that matches both the first and the second pattern. Can you solve this riddle?\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of patterns. Next *n* lines contain the patterns.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the patterns can only consist of small English letters and symbols '?'. All patterns are non-empty and have the same length. The total length of all the patterns does not exceed 105 characters.. Output specification: In a single line print the answer to the problem \u2014 the pattern with the minimal number of signs '?', which intersects with each of the given ones.

Pattern xab intersects with each of the given patterns. Pattern ??? also intersects with each of the given patterns, but it contains more question signs, hence it is not an optimal answer. Clearly, xab is the optimal answer, because it doesn't contain any question sign. There are a lot of other optimal answers, for example: aab, bab, cab, dab and so on."}]}}

Hitagi's sequence has been broken for a long time, but now Kaiki provides an opportunity.\n\nHitagi's sequence *a* has a length of *n*. Lost elements in it are denoted by zeros. Kaiki provides another sequence *b*, whose length *k* equals the number of lost elements in *a* (i.e. the number of zeros). Hitagi is to replace each zero in *a* with an element from *b* so that each element in *b* should be used exactly once. Hitagi knows, however, that, apart from 0, no integer occurs in *a* and *b* more than once in total.\n\nIf the resulting sequence is not an increasing sequence, then it has the power to recover Hitagi from the oddity.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: After the Search Ultimate program that searched for strings in a text failed, Igor K. got to think: \"Why on Earth does my program work so slowly?\" As he double-checked his code, he said: \"My code contains no errors, yet I know how we will improve Search Ultimate!\" and took a large book from the shelves. The book read \"Azembler. Principally New Approach\".\n\nHaving carefully thumbed through the book, Igor K. realised that, as it turns out, you can multiply the numbers dozens of times faster. \"Search Ultimate will be faster than it has ever been!\" \u2014 the fellow shouted happily and set to work.\n\nLet us now clarify what Igor's idea was. The thing is that the code that was generated by a compiler was far from perfect. Standard multiplying does work slower than with the trick the book mentioned.\n\nThe Azembler language operates with 26 registers (eax, ebx, ..., ezx) and two commands: \n -  [*x*] \u2014 returns the value located in the address *x*. For example, [eax] returns the value that was located in the address, equal to the value in the register eax. -  lea *x*, *y* \u2014 assigns to the register *x*, indicated as the first operand, the second operand's address. Thus, for example, the \"lea ebx, [eax]\" command will write in the ebx register the content of the eax register: first the [eax] operation will be fulfilled, the result of it will be some value that lies in the address written in eax. But we do not need the value \u2014 the next operation will be lea, that will take the [eax] address, i.e., the value in the eax register, and will write it in ebx. \nOn the first thought the second operation seems meaningless, but as it turns out, it is acceptable to write the operation as \n\nlea ecx, [eax + ebx],\n\nlea ecx, [k*eax]\n\nor even\n\nlea ecx, [ebx + k*eax],\n\nwhere k = 1, 2, 4 or 8.\n\nAs a result, the register ecx will be equal to the numbers eax + ebx, k*eax and ebx + k*eax correspondingly. However, such operation is fulfilled many times, dozens of times faster that the usual multiplying of numbers. And using several such operations, one can very quickly multiply some number by some other one. Of course, instead of eax, ebx and ecx you are allowed to use any registers.\n\nFor example, let the eax register contain some number that we should multiply by 41. It takes us 2 lines:\n\nlea ebx, [eax + 4*eax] // now ebx = 5*eax\n\nlea eax, [eax + 8*ebx] // now eax = eax + 8*ebx = 41*eax\n\nIgor K. got interested in the following question: what is the minimum number of lea operations needed to multiply by the given number *n* and how to do it? Your task is to help him.\n\nConsider that at the initial moment of time eax contains a number that Igor K. was about to multiply by *n*, and the registers from ebx to ezx contain number 0. At the final moment of time the result can be located in any register.\nInput specification: The input data contain the only integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=255), which Igor K. is about to multiply.. Output specification: On the first line print number *p*, which represents the minimum number of lea operations, needed to do that. Then print the program consisting of *p* commands, performing the operations. It is guaranteed that such program exists for any *n* from 1 to 255.\n\nUse precisely the following format of commands (here *k* is equal to 1, 2, 4 or 8, and *x*, *y* and *z* are any, even coinciding registers):\n\nlea x, [y]\n\nlea x, [y + z]\n\nlea x, [k*y]\n\nlea x, [y + k*z]\n\nPlease note that extra spaces at the end of a command are unacceptable.\nDemo input: ['41\\n', '2\\n', '4\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\nlea ebx, [eax + 4*eax]\\nlea ecx, [eax + 8*ebx]\\n', '1\\nlea ebx, [eax + eax]\\n', '1\\nlea ebx, [4*eax]\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective. You are able to cope with it not worse, aren't you?\nInput specification: The first and single line contains two integers *A* and *B* (1<=\u2264<=*A*,<=*B*<=\u2264<=109,<=*min*(*A*,<=*B*)<=\u2264<=12).. Output specification: Print a single integer denoting the greatest common divisor of integers *A*! and *B*!.\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n'], Demo output: ['6\\n']\nNote: Consider the sample.\n\n4!\u2009=\u20091\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74\u2009=\u200924. 3!\u2009=\u20091\u00b72\u00b73\u2009=\u20096. The greatest common divisor of integers 24 and 6 is exactly 6."}]}}

Simon receives number *a* and Antisimon receives number *b*. They also have a heap of *n* stones. The players take turns to make a move and Simon starts. During a move a player should take from the heap the number of stones equal to the greatest common divisor of the fixed number he has received and the number of stones left in the heap. A player loses when he cannot take the required number of stones (i. e. the heap has strictly less stones left than one needs to take). \n\nYour task is to determine by the given *a*, *b* and *n* who wins the game.\nInput specification: The only string contains space-separated integers *a*, *b* and *n* (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*,<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the fixed numbers Simon and Antisimon have received correspondingly and the initial number of stones in the pile..

After his move the heap has 6 stones left.-  Antisimon should take *gcd*(5,\u20096)\u2009=\u20091 stone from the heap. After his move the heap has 5 stones left.-  Simon should take *gcd*(3,\u20095)\u2009=\u20091 stone from the heap. After his move the heap has 4 stones left.-  Antisimon should take *gcd*(5,\u20094)\u2009=\u20091 stone from the heap.

After his move the heap has 0 stones left.-  Antisimon should take *gcd*(5,\u20090)\u2009=\u20095 stones from the heap. As 0\u2009&lt;\u20095, it is impossible and Antisimon loses.\nIn the second sample each player during each move takes one stone from the heap. As *n* is even, Antisimon takes the last stone and Simon can't make a move after that."}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: An IPv6-address is a 128-bit number. For convenience, this number is recorded in blocks of 16 bits in hexadecimal record, the blocks are separated by colons \u2014 8 blocks in total, each block has four hexadecimal digits. Here is an example of the correct record of a IPv6 address: \"0124:5678:90ab:cdef:0124:5678:90ab:cdef\". We'll call such format of recording an IPv6-address full.\n\nBesides the full record of an IPv6 address there is a short record format. The record of an IPv6 address can be shortened by removing one or more leading zeroes at the beginning of each block. However, each block should contain at least one digit in the short format. For example, the leading zeroes can be removed like that: \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:f19a:1000:0000\" <=\u2192<= \"a56f:d3:0:0124:01:f19a:1000:00\". There are more ways to shorten zeroes in this IPv6 address.\n\nSome IPv6 addresses contain long sequences of zeroes. Continuous sequences of 16-bit zero blocks can be shortened to \"::\". A sequence can consist of one or several consecutive blocks, with all 16 bits equal to 0. \n\nYou can see examples of zero block shortenings below:\n -  \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:0000:0000:0000\" <=\u2192<= \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001::\"; -  \"a56f:0000:0000:0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\" <=\u2192<= \"a56f::0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\"; -  \"a56f:0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\" <=\u2192<= \"a56f:0000::0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\"; -  \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:0000:0000:0000\" <=\u2192<= \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001::0000\"; -  \"0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000\" <=\u2192<= \"::\". \nIt is not allowed to shorten zero blocks in the address more than once. This means that the short record can't contain the sequence of characters \"::\" more than once. Otherwise, it will sometimes be impossible to determine the number of zero blocks, each represented by a double colon.\n\nThe format of the record of the IPv6 address after removing the leading zeroes and shortening the zero blocks is called short.\n\nYou've got several short records of IPv6 addresses. Restore their full record.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* \u2014 the number of records to restore (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100).\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains a string \u2014 the short IPv6 addresses. Each string only consists of string characters \"0123456789abcdef:\".\n\nIt is guaranteed that each short address is obtained by the way that is described in the statement from some full IPv6 address.. Output specification: For each short IPv6 address from the input print its full record on a separate line. Print the full records for the short IPv6 addresses in the order, in which the short records follow in the input.\nDemo input: ['6\\na56f:d3:0:0124:01:f19a:1000:00\\na56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001::\\na56f::0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\\na56f:0000::0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\\n::\\n0ea::4d:f4:6:0\\n'], Demo output: ['a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:f19a:1000:0000\\na56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:0000:0000:0000\\na56f:0000:0000:0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\\na56f:0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\\n0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000\\n00ea:0000:0000:0000:004d:00f4:0006:0000\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.\n\nCreating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section. At that, the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section. That is, for example, the garden can be represented by a 1<=\u00d7<=5 rectangle, where the section heights are equal to 4, 2, 3, 3, 2.

Write a python script for the following problem: Vasya is developing his own programming language VPL (Vasya Programming Language). Right now he is busy making the system of exceptions. He thinks that the system of exceptions must function like that.\n\nThe exceptions are processed by try-catch-blocks. There are two operators that work with the blocks:\n1.  The try operator. It opens a new try-catch-block. 1.  The catch(&lt;exception_type&gt;, &lt;message&gt;) operator. It closes the try-catch-block that was started last and haven't yet been closed. This block can be activated only via exception of type &lt;exception_type&gt;. When we activate this block, the screen displays the &lt;message&gt;. If at the given moment there is no open try-catch-block, then we can't use the catch operator.\nThe exceptions can occur in the program in only one case: when we use the throw operator. The throw(&lt;exception_type&gt;) operator creates the exception of the given type.\n\nLet's suggest that as a result of using some throw operator the program created an exception of type *a*. In this case a try-catch-block is activated, such that this block's try operator was described in the program earlier than the used throw operator. Also, this block's catch operator was given an exception type *a* as a parameter and this block's catch operator is described later that the used throw operator. If there are several such try-catch-blocks, then the system activates the block whose catch operator occurs earlier than others. If no try-catch-block was activated, then the screen displays message \"Unhandled Exception\".\n\nTo test the system, Vasya wrote a program that contains only try, catch and throw operators, one line contains no more than one operator, the whole program contains exactly one throw operator.\n\nYour task is: given a program in VPL, determine, what message will be displayed on the screen.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer: *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) the number of lines in the program. Next *n* lines contain the program in language VPL. Each line contains no more than one operator. It means that input file can contain empty lines and lines, consisting only of spaces.\n\nThe program contains only operators try, catch and throw. It is guaranteed that the program is correct. It means that each started try-catch-block was closed, the catch operators aren't used unless there is an open try-catch-block. The program has exactly one throw operator. The program may have spaces at the beginning of a line, at the end of a line, before and after a bracket, a comma or a quote mark.\n\nThe exception type is a nonempty string, that consists only of upper and lower case english letters. The length of the string does not exceed 20 symbols. Message is a nonempty string, that consists only of upper and lower case english letters, digits and spaces. Message is surrounded with quote marks. Quote marks shouldn't be printed. The length of the string does not exceed 20 symbols.\n\nLength of any line in the input file does not exceed 50 symbols.. Output specification: Print the message the screen will show after the given program is executed.\nDemo input: ['8\\ntry\\n    try\\n        throw ( AE ) \\n    catch ( BE, \"BE in line 3\")\\n\\n    try\\n    catch(AE, \"AE in line 5\") \\ncatch(AE,\"AE somewhere\")\\n', '8\\ntry\\n    try\\n        throw ( AE ) \\n    catch ( AE, \"AE in line 3\")\\n\\n    try\\n    catch(BE, \"BE in line 5\") \\ncatch(AE,\"AE somewhere\")\\n', '8\\ntry\\n    try\\n        throw ( CE ) \\n    catch ( BE, \"BE in line 3\")\\n\\n    try\\n    catch(AE, \"AE in line 5\") \\ncatch(AE,\"AE somewhere\")\\n'], Demo output: ['AE somewhere\\n', 'AE in line 3\\n', 'Unhandled Exception\\n']\nNote: In the first sample there are 2 try-catch-blocks such that try operator is described earlier than throw operator and catch operator is described later than throw operator: try-catch(BE,\"BE in line 3\") and try-catch(AE,\"AE somewhere\"). Exception type is AE, so the second block will be activated, because operator catch(AE,\"AE somewhere\") has exception type AE as parameter and operator catch(BE,\"BE in line 3\") has exception type BE.\n\nIn the second sample there are 2 try-catch-blocks such that try operator is described earlier than throw operator and catch operator is described later than throw operator: try-catch(AE,\"AE in line 3\") and try-catch(AE,\"AE somewhere\"). Exception type is AE, so both blocks can be activated, but only the first one will be activated, because operator catch(AE,\"AE in line 3\") is described earlier than catch(AE,\"AE somewhere\")\n\nIn the third sample there is no blocks that can be activated by an exception of type CE."}]}}

As we know from the previous problem, the nervous system of a zombie consists of *n* brains and *m* brain connectors joining some pairs of brains together.

More precisely, we define the distance between two brains *u* and *v* (1<=\u2264<=*u*,<=*v*<=\u2264<=*n*) as the minimum number of brain connectors used when transmitting a thought between these two brains. The brain latency of a zombie is defined to be the maximum distance between any two of its brains.

However, Vasilisa the Wise does not know what the box's secret is, since she cannot open it again. She hopes that you will help her one more time with that.\n\nThe box's lock looks as follows: it contains 4 identical deepenings for gems as a 2<=\u00d7<=2 square, and some integer numbers are written at the lock's edge near the deepenings. The example of a lock is given on the picture below.\n\nThe box is accompanied with 9 gems. Their shapes match the deepenings' shapes and each gem contains one number from 1 to 9 (each number is written on exactly one gem). The box will only open after it is decorated with gems correctly: that is, each deepening in the lock should be filled with exactly one gem. Also, the sums of numbers in the square's rows, columns and two diagonals of the square should match the numbers written at the lock's edge. For example, the above lock will open if we fill the deepenings with gems with numbers as is shown on the picture below.\n\nNow Vasilisa the Wise wants to define, given the numbers on the box's lock, which gems she should put in the deepenings to open the box. Help Vasilisa to solve this challenging task.\nInput specification: The input contains numbers written on the edges of the lock of the box.

If Vasya's younger brother chose the segment [2,<=6], then after the reversal the coin order will change to 1 6 5 4 3 2 7 8. Vasya suspects that someone else could have spoilt the permutation after his brother. Help him to find that out.

It is guaranteed that the given sequence is a permutation, i.e. it contains only integers from 1 to *n*, and every number is used exactly 1 time.. Output specification: If it is impossible to obtain the given permutation from the original one in exactly one action, print 0 0. Otherwise, print two numbers *l* *r* (1<=\u2264<=*l*<=&lt;<=*r*<=\u2264<=*n*) which are the endpoints of the segment that needs to be reversed to obtain from permutation 1 2 ... *n* the given one.\nDemo input: ['8\\n1 6 5 4 3 2 7 8\\n', '4\\n2 3 4 1\\n', '4\\n1 2 3 4\\n'], Demo output: ['2 6\\n', '0 0\\n', '0 0\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Your task is to say if the hidden number is prime or composite.\n\nInteger *x*<=&gt;<=1 is called prime if it has exactly two distinct divisors, 1 and *x*. If integer *x*<=&gt;<=1 is not prime, it's called composite.\n\nYou can ask up to 20 queries about divisors of the hidden number. In each query you should print an integer from interval [2,<=100]. The system will answer \"yes\" if your integer is a divisor of the hidden number. Otherwise, the answer will be \"no\".\n\nFor example, if the hidden number is 14 then the system will answer \"yes\" only if you print 2, 7 or 14.\n\nWhen you are done asking queries, print \"prime\" or \"composite\" and terminate your program.\n\nYou will get the Wrong Answer verdict if you ask more than 20 queries, or if you print an integer not from the range [2,<=100]. Also, you will get the Wrong Answer verdict if the printed answer isn't correct.\n\nYou will get the Idleness Limit Exceeded verdict if you don't print anything (but you should) or if you forget about flushing the output (more info below).\nInput specification: After each query you should read one string from the input. It will be \"yes\" if the printed integer is a divisor of the hidden number, and \"no\" otherwise.. Output specification: Up to 20 times you can ask a query\u00a0\u2014 print an integer from interval [2,<=100] in one line. You have to both print the end-of-line character and flush the output. After flushing you should read a response from the input.\n\nIn any moment you can print the answer \"prime\" or \"composite\" (without the quotes). After that, flush the output and terminate your program.\n\nTo flush you can use (just after printing an integer and end-of-line): \n -  fflush(stdout) in C++; -  System.out.flush() in Java; -  stdout.flush() in Python; -  flush(output) in Pascal; -  See the documentation for other languages. \nHacking. To hack someone, as the input you should print the hidden number\u00a0\u2014 one integer from the interval [2,<=100].

In the interval [2,\u2009100] there is only one number with this divisor. The hidden number must be 59, which is prime. Note that the answer is known even after the second query and you could print it then and terminate.

Since the demand for bakery drops heavily in the evening, there is a special 20% discount for buns starting from 20:00 (note that the cost might become rational). Of course, buns cannot be sold by parts.\n\nDetermine the minimum amount of money Andrew has to spend in order to feed his cat. The cat is considered fed if its hunger level is less than or equal to zero.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *hh* and *mm* (00<=\u2264<=*hh*<=\u2264<=23,<=00<=\u2264<=*mm*<=\u2264<=59) \u2014 the time of Andrew's awakening.\n\nThe second line contains four integers *H*, *D*, *C* and *N* (1<=\u2264<=*H*<=\u2264<=105,<=1<=\u2264<=*D*,<=*C*,<=*N*<=\u2264<=102)..

The cat's hunger will be equal to 315, hence it will be necessary to purchase 315 buns. The discount makes the final answer 25200 roubles.\n\nIn the second sample it's optimal to visit the store right after he wakes up. Then he'll have to buy 91 bins per 15 roubles each and spend a total of 1365 roubles."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective.

Write a python script for the following problem: Further research on zombie thought processes yielded interesting results. As we know from the previous problem, the nervous system of a zombie consists of *n* brains and *m* brain connectors joining some pairs of brains together. It was observed that the intellectual abilities of a zombie depend mainly on the topology of its nervous system. More precisely, we define the distance between two brains *u* and *v* (1<=\u2264<=*u*,<=*v*<=\u2264<=*n*) as the minimum number of brain connectors used when transmitting a thought between these two brains. The brain latency of a zombie is defined to be the maximum distance between any two of its brains. Researchers conjecture that the brain latency is the crucial parameter which determines how smart a given zombie is. Help them test this conjecture by writing a program to compute brain latencies of nervous systems.\n\nIn this problem you may assume that any nervous system given in the input is valid, i.e., it satisfies conditions (1) and (2) from the easy version.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100000) denoting the number of brains (which are conveniently numbered from 1 to *n*) and the number of brain connectors in the nervous system, respectively.
