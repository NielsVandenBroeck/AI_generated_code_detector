Write a python script for the following problem: Petya loves computer games. Finally a game that he's been waiting for so long came out!\n\nThe main character of this game has *n* different skills, each of which is characterized by an integer *a**i* from 0 to 100. The higher the number *a**i* is, the higher is the *i*-th skill of the character. The total rating of the character is calculated as the sum of the values \u200b\u200bof  for all *i* from 1 to *n*. The expression \u230a *x*\u230b denotes the result of rounding the number *x* down to the nearest integer.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Petya got *k* improvement units as a bonus that he can use to increase the skills of his character and his total rating. One improvement unit can increase any skill of Petya's character by exactly one. For example, if *a*4<==<=46, after using one imporvement unit to this skill, it becomes equal to 47. A hero's skill cannot rise higher more than 100. Thus, it is permissible that some of the units will remain unused.\n\nYour task is to determine the optimal way of using the improvement units so as to maximize the overall rating of the character. It is not necessary to use all the improvement units.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two positive integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=107) \u2014 the number of skills of the character and the number of units of improvements at Petya's disposal.\n\nThe second line of the input contains a sequence of *n* integers *a**i* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100), where *a**i* characterizes the level of the *i*-th skill of the character.. Output specification: The first line of the output should contain a single non-negative integer \u2014 the maximum total rating of the character that Petya can get using *k* or less improvement units.\nDemo input: ['2 4\\n7 9\\n', '3 8\\n17 15 19\\n', '2 2\\n99 100\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '5\\n', '20\\n']\nNote: In the first test case the optimal strategy is as follows. Petya has to improve the first skill to 10 by spending 3 improvement units, and the second skill to 10, by spending one improvement unit. Thus, Petya spends all his improvement units and the total rating of the character becomes equal to  *lfloor* *frac*{100}{10} *rfloor*\u2009+\u2009 *lfloor* *frac*{100}{10} *rfloor*\u2009=\u200910\u2009+\u200910\u2009=\u2009 20.\n\nIn the second test the optimal strategy for Petya is to improve the first skill to 20 (by spending 3 improvement units) and to improve the third skill to 20 (in this case by spending 1 improvement units). Thus, Petya is left with 4 improvement units and he will be able to increase the second skill to 19 (which does not change the overall rating, so Petya does not necessarily have to do it). Therefore, the highest possible total rating in this example is <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/ccaa4e1e435ea3a339c322e03a32de69d214a257.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>.\n\nIn the third test case the optimal strategy for Petya is to increase the first skill to 100 by spending 1 improvement unit. Thereafter, both skills of the character will be equal to 100, so Petya will not be able to spend the remaining improvement unit. So the answer is equal to <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/b246630ca7d1b95b91970759bd8455cb3e930bf9.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>."}]}}

We denote the length of word *x* as |*x*|. Note that after removing one letter, the indices of other letters don't change. For example, if *t*<==<=\"nastya\" and *a*<==<=[4,<=1,<=5,<=3,<=2,<=6] then removals make the following sequence of words \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\".\n\nSergey knows this permutation. His goal is to stop his sister at some point and continue removing by himself to get the word *p*. Since Nastya likes this activity, Sergey wants to stop her as late as possible. Your task is to determine, how many letters Nastya can remove before she will be stopped by Sergey.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the word *p* can be obtained by removing the letters from word *t*.\nInput specification: The first and second lines of the input contain the words *t* and *p*, respectively. Words are composed of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet (1<=\u2264<=|*p*|<=&lt;<=|*t*|<=\u2264<=200<=000). It is guaranteed that the word *p* can be obtained by removing the letters from word *t*.\n\nNext line contains a permutation *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a*|*t*| of letter indices that specifies the order in which Nastya removes letters of *t* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=|*t*|, all *a**i* are distinct).. Output specification: Print a single integer number, the maximum number of letters that Nastya can remove.\nDemo input: ['ababcba\\nabb\\n5 3 4 1 7 6 2\\n', 'bbbabb\\nbb\\n1 6 3 4 2 5\\n'], Demo output: ['3', '4']\nNote: In the first sample test sequence of removing made by Nastya looks like this:\n\n\"ababcba\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ababcba\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ababcba\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ababcba\" \n\nNastya can not continue, because it is impossible to get word \"abb\" from word \"ababcba\".\n\nSo, Nastya will remove only three letters."}]}}

In this problem we will only consider three of such classes: weapon, armor, orb.\n\nBesides, there's a whole new world hidden inside each item. We can increase an item's level travelling to its world. We can also capture the so-called residents in the Item World\n\nResidents are the creatures that live inside items. Each resident gives some bonus to the item in which it is currently located. We will only consider residents of types: gladiator (who improves the item's atk), sentry (who improves def) and physician (who improves res).\n\nEach item has the size parameter. The parameter limits the maximum number of residents that can live inside an item. We can move residents between items.

He hates trains, so he has decided to get from one city to another by car.\n\nThe path from Moscow to Saratov can be represented as a straight line (well, it's not that straight in reality, but in this problem we will consider it to be straight), and the distance between Moscow and Saratov is $n$ km. Let's say that Moscow is situated at the point with coordinate $0$ km, and Saratov \u2014 at coordinate $n$ km.\n\nDriving for a long time may be really difficult. Formally, if Leha has already covered $i$ kilometers since he stopped to have a rest, he considers the difficulty of covering $(i + 1)$-th kilometer as $a_{i + 1}$. It is guaranteed that for every $i \\in [1, n - 1]$ $a_i \\le a_{i + 1}$. The difficulty of the journey is denoted as the sum of difficulties of each kilometer in the journey.\n\nFortunately, there may be some rest sites between Moscow and Saratov. Every integer point from $1$ to $n - 1$ may contain a rest site. When Leha enters a rest site, he may have a rest, and the next kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the kilometer after it \u2014 difficulty $a_2$, and so on.\n\nFor example, if $n = 5$ and there is a rest site in coordinate $2$, the difficulty of journey will be $2a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3$: the first kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the second one \u2014 $a_2$, then Leha will have a rest, and the third kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the fourth \u2014 $a_2$, and the last one \u2014 $a_3$. Another example: if $n = 7$ and there are rest sites in coordinates $1$ and $5$, the difficulty of Leha's journey is $3a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3 + a_4$.\n\nLeha doesn't know which integer points contain rest sites. So he has to consider every possible situation. Obviously, there are $2^{n - 1}$ different distributions of rest sites (two distributions are different if there exists some point $x$ such that it contains a rest site in exactly one of these distributions). Leha considers all these distributions to be equiprobable. He wants to calculate $p$ \u2014 the expected value of difficulty of his journey.\n\nObviously, $p \\cdot 2^{n - 1}$ is an integer number.

Write a python script for the following problem: Kicker (table football) is a board game based on football, in which players control the footballers' figures mounted on rods by using bars to get the ball into the opponent's goal. When playing two on two, one player of each team controls the goalkeeper and the full-backs (plays defence), the other player controls the half-backs and forwards (plays attack).\n\nTwo teams of company Q decided to battle each other. Let's enumerate players from both teams by integers from 1 to 4. The first and second player play in the first team, the third and the fourth one play in the second team. For each of the four players we know their game skills in defence and attack. The defence skill of the *i*-th player is *a**i*, the attack skill is *b**i*.\n\nBefore the game, the teams determine how they will play. First the players of the first team decide who will play in the attack, and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do the same, based on the choice of their opponents.\n\nWe will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is strictly greater than the opponent's defence.\n\nThe teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally. Identify the team that is guaranteed to win (if both teams act optimally) or tell that there is no such team.\nInput specification: The input contain the players' description in four lines. The *i*-th line contains two space-separated integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the defence and the attack skill of the *i*-th player, correspondingly.. Output specification: If the first team can win, print phrase \"Team 1\" (without the quotes), if the second team can win, print phrase \"Team 2\" (without the quotes). If no of the teams can definitely win, print \"Draw\" (without the quotes).\nDemo input: ['1 100\\n100 1\\n99 99\\n99 99\\n', '1 1\\n2 2\\n3 3\\n2 2\\n', '3 3\\n2 2\\n1 1\\n2 2\\n'], Demo output: ['Team 1\\n', 'Team 2\\n', 'Draw\\n']\nNote: Let consider the first test sample. The first team can definitely win if it will choose the following arrangement: the first player plays attack, the second player plays defence.\n\nConsider the second sample. The order of the choosing roles for players makes sense in this sample. As the members of the first team choose first, the members of the second team can beat them (because they know the exact defence value and attack value of the first team)."}]}}

She also has put a robot at each end of the row (to the left of the first number and to the right of the last number). Sonya will give a number to each robot (they can be either same or different) and run them. When a robot is running, it is moving toward to another robot, reading numbers in the row. When a robot is reading a number that is equal to the number that was given to that robot, it will turn off and stay in the same position.\n\nSonya does not want robots to break, so she will give such numbers that robots will stop before they meet.

In that case, robots will not meet each other. As a result, robots will not be broken.

In other words, she wants to know the number of pairs ($p$, $q$), where she will give $p$ to the first robot and $q$ to the second one. Pairs ($p_i$, $q_i$) and ($p_j$, $q_j$) are different if $p_i\\neq p_j$ or $q_i\\neq q_j$.\n\nUnfortunately, Sonya is busy fixing robots that broke after a failed launch.

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes. The second line contains integers *x**c* and *y**c* \u2014 the initial square's coordinates (1<=\u2264<=*x**c*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y**c*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nThe third line contains an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the number of vectors.

He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Manao works on a sports TV. He's spent much time watching the football games of some country. After a while he began to notice different patterns. For example, each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform and guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well. For each team the color of the home and guest uniform is different.\n\nThere are *n* teams taking part in the national championship. The championship consists of *n*\u00b7(*n*<=-<=1) games: each team invites each other team to its stadium. At this point Manao wondered: how many times during the championship is a host team going to put on the guest uniform? Note that the order of the games does not affect this number.\n\nYou know the colors of the home and guest uniform for each team. For simplicity, the colors are numbered by integers in such a way that no two distinct colors have the same number. Help Manao find the answer to his question.\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=30). Each of the following *n* lines contains a pair of distinct space-separated integers *h**i*, *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*h**i*,<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the colors of the *i*-th team's home and guest uniforms, respectively.. Output specification: In a single line print the number of games where the host team is going to play in the guest uniform.\nDemo input: ['3\\n1 2\\n2 4\\n3 4\\n', '4\\n100 42\\n42 100\\n5 42\\n100 5\\n', '2\\n1 2\\n1 2\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '5\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: In the first test case the championship consists of 6 games. The only game with the event in question is the game between teams 2 and 1 on the stadium of team 2.\n\nIn the second test sample the host team will have to wear guest uniform in the games between teams: 1 and 2, 2 and 1, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, 4 and 2 (the host team is written first)."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Polycarp thinks about the meaning of life very often. He does this constantly, even when typing in the editor. Every time he starts brooding he can no longer fully concentrate and repeatedly presses the keys that need to be pressed only once. For example, instead of the phrase \"how are you\" he can type \"hhoow aaaare yyoouu\". \n\nPolycarp decided to automate the process of correcting such errors. He decided to write a plug-in to the text editor that will remove pairs of identical consecutive letters (if there are any in the text). Of course, this is not exactly what Polycarp needs, but he's got to start from something! \n\nHelp Polycarp and write the main plug-in module. Your program should remove from a string all pairs of identical letters, which are consecutive. If after the removal there appear new pairs, the program should remove them as well. Technically, its work should be equivalent to the following: while the string contains a pair of consecutive identical letters, the pair should be deleted. Note that deleting of the consecutive identical letters can be done in any order, as any order leads to the same result.\nInput specification: The input data consists of a single line to be processed.

The education is not easy because you need to have fundamental knowledge in different areas, which sometimes are not related to each other. \n\nFor example, you should know linguistics very well. You learn a structure of Reberland language as foreign language. In this language words are constructed according to the following rules. First you need to choose the \"root\" of the word \u2014 some string which has more than 4 letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3 symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction \u2014  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row. All these strings are considered to be suffixes of the word (this time we use word \"suffix\" to describe a morpheme but not the few last characters of the string as you may used to). \n\nHere is one exercise that you have found in your task list. You are given the word *s*. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language. \n\nTwo strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match. \n\nLet's look at the example: the word *abacabaca* is given. This word can be obtained in the following ways: , where the root of the word is overlined, and suffixes are marked by \"corners\". Thus, the set of possible suffixes for this word is {*aca*,<=*ba*,<=*ca*}.\nInput specification: The only line contains a string *s* (5<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=104) consisting of lowercase English letters..

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Petya wrote a programme on C++ that calculated a very interesting function *f*(*n*). Petya ran the program with a certain value of *n* and went to the kitchen to have some tea. The history has no records concerning how long the program had been working. By the time Petya returned, it had completed the calculations and had the result. However while Petya was drinking tea, a sly virus managed to destroy the input file so that Petya can't figure out for which value of *n* the program was run. Help Petya, carry out the inverse function!\n\nMostly, the program consists of a function in C++ with the following simplified syntax:\n -  *function* ::= int f(int n) {*operatorSequence*}-  *operatorSequence* ::= *operator*\u00a0|\u00a0*operator*\u00a0*operatorSequence*-  *operator* ::= return *arithmExpr*; | if (*logicalExpr*) return *arithmExpr*;-  *logicalExpr* ::= *arithmExpr*<=&gt;<=*arithmExpr* | *arithmExpr*<=&lt;<=*arithmExpr* | *arithmExpr* == *arithmExpr*-  *arithmExpr* ::= *sum*-  *sum* ::= *product* | *sum*<=+<=*product* | *sum*<=-<=*product*-  *product* ::= *multiplier* | *product*<=*<=*multiplier* | *product*<=/<=*multiplier*-  *multiplier* ::= n | *number* | f(*arithmExpr*)-  *number* ::= 0|1|2|... |32767 \nThe whitespaces in a *operatorSequence* are optional.\n\nThus, we have a function, in which body there are two kinds of operators. There is the operator \"return *arithmExpr*;\" that returns the value of the expression as the value of the function, and there is the conditional operator \"if (*logicalExpr*) return *arithmExpr*;\" that returns the value of the arithmetical expression when and only when the logical expression is true. Guaranteed that no other constructions of C++ language \u2014 cycles, assignment operators, nested conditional operators etc, and other variables except the *n* parameter are used in the function. All the constants are integers in the interval [0..32767].\n\nThe operators are performed sequentially. After the function has returned a value other operators in the sequence are not performed. Arithmetical expressions are performed taking into consideration the standard priority of the operations. It means that first all the products that are part of the sum are calculated. During the calculation of the products the operations of multiplying and division are performed from the left to the right. Then the summands are summed, and the addition and the subtraction are also performed from the left to the right. Operations \"&gt;\" (more), \"&lt;\" (less) and \"==\" (equals) also have standard meanings.\n\nNow you've got to pay close attention! The program is compiled with the help of 15-bit Berland C++ compiler invented by a Berland company BerSoft, that's why arithmetical operations are performed in a non-standard way. Addition, subtraction and multiplication are performed modulo 32768 (if the result of subtraction is negative, then 32768 is added to it until the number belongs to the interval [0..32767]). Division \"/\" is a usual integer division where the remainder is omitted.\n\nExamples of arithmetical operations: \n\nGuaranteed that for all values of *n* from 0 to 32767 the given function is performed correctly. That means that:\n\n1. Division by 0 never occures.\n\n2. When performing a function for the value *n*<==<=*N* recursive calls of the function *f* may occur only for the parameter value of 0,<=1,<=...,<=*N*<=-<=1. Consequently, the program never has an infinite recursion.\n\n3. As the result of the sequence of the operators, the function always returns a value.\n\nWe have to mention that due to all the limitations the value returned by the function *f* is independent from either global variables or the order of performing the calculations of arithmetical expressions as part of the logical one, or from anything else except the value of *n* parameter. That's why the *f* function can be regarded as a function in its mathematical sense, i.e. as a unique correspondence between any value of *n* from the interval [0..32767] and a value of *f*(*n*) from the same interval.\n\nGiven the value of *f*(*n*), and you should find *n*. If the suitable *n* value is not unique, you should find the maximal one (from the interval [0..32767]).\nInput specification: The first line has an integer *f*(*n*) from the interval [0..32767]. The next lines have the description of the function *f*. In the description can be found extra spaces and line breaks (see the examples) which, of course, can\u2019t break key words int, if, return and numbers. The size of input data can\u2019t exceed 100 bytes.. Output specification: Output a single number \u2014 the answer to the problem. If there\u2019s no answer, output \"-1\" (without quotes).\nDemo input: ['17\\nint f(int n)\\n{\\nif (n &lt; 100) return 17;\\nif (n &gt; 99) return 27;\\n}\\n', '13\\nint f(int n)\\n{\\nif (n == 0) return 0;\\nreturn f(n - 1) + 1;\\n}\\n', '144\\nint f(int n)\\n{\\nif (n == 0) return 0;\\nif (n == 1) return n;\\nreturn f(n - 1) + f(n - 2);\\n}'], Demo output: ['99\\n', '13', '24588\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Otherwise output a single line with \"NO\".\nDemo input: ['5\\n.#...\\n####.\\n.####\\n...#.\\n.....\\n', '4\\n####\\n####\\n####\\n####\\n', '6\\n.#....\\n####..\\n.####.\\n.#.##.\\n######\\n.#..#.\\n', '6\\n.#..#.\\n######\\n.####.\\n.####.\\n######\\n.#..#.\\n', '3\\n...\\n...\\n...\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n', 'YES\\n', 'NO\\n', 'YES\\n']\nNote: In example 1, you can draw two crosses. The picture below shows what they look like.\n\nIn example 2, the board contains 16 cells with '#', but each cross contains 5. Since 16 is not a multiple of 5, so it's impossible to cover all."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: String can be called correct if it consists of characters \"0\" and \"1\" and there are no redundant leading zeroes. Here are some examples: \"0\", \"10\", \"1001\".\n\nYou are given a correct string *s*.\n\nYou can perform two different operations on this string: \n 1.  swap any pair of adjacent characters (for example, \"101\"  \"110\"); 1.  replace \"11\" with \"1\" (for example, \"110\"  \"10\"). \nLet *val*(*s*) be such a number that *s* is its binary representation.\n\nCorrect string *a* is less than some other correct string *b* iff *val*(*a*)<=&lt;<=*val*(*b*).\n\nYour task is to find the minimum correct string that you can obtain from the given one using the operations described above. You can use these operations any number of times in any order (or even use no operations at all).\nInput specification: The first line contains integer number *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the length of string *s*.\n\nThe second line contains the string *s* consisting of characters \"0\" and \"1\". It is guaranteed that the string *s* is correct.. Output specification: Print one string \u2014 the minimum correct string that you can obtain from the given one.\nDemo input: ['4\\n1001\\n', '1\\n1\\n'], Demo output: ['100\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: In the first example you can obtain the answer by the following sequence of operations: \"1001\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"1010\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"1100\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"100\".\n\nIn the second example you can't obtain smaller answer no matter what operations you use."}]}}
