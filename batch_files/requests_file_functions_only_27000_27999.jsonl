Of course, this is not exactly what Polycarp needs, but he's got to start from something! \n\nHelp Polycarp and write the main plug-in module. Your program should remove from a string all pairs of identical letters, which are consecutive. If after the removal there appear new pairs, the program should remove them as well. Technically, its work should be equivalent to the following: while the string contains a pair of consecutive identical letters, the pair should be deleted. Note that deleting of the consecutive identical letters can be done in any order, as any order leads to the same result.\nInput specification: The input data consists of a single line to be processed.

Write a python script for the following problem: Arcady is a copywriter. His today's task is to type up an already well-designed story using his favorite text editor.\n\nArcady types words, punctuation signs and spaces one after another. Each letter and each sign (including line feed) requires one keyboard click in order to be printed. Moreover, when Arcady has a non-empty prefix of some word on the screen, the editor proposes a possible autocompletion for this word, more precisely one of the already printed words such that its prefix matches the currently printed prefix if this word is unique. For example, if Arcady has already printed \u00abcodeforces\u00bb, \u00abcoding\u00bb and \u00abcodeforces\u00bb once again, then there will be no autocompletion attempt for \u00abcod\u00bb, but if he proceeds with \u00abcode\u00bb, the editor will propose \u00abcodeforces\u00bb.\n\nWith a single click Arcady can follow the editor's proposal, i.e. to transform the current prefix to it. Note that no additional symbols are printed after the autocompletion (no spaces, line feeds, etc). What is the minimum number of keyboard clicks Arcady has to perform to print the entire text, if he is not allowed to move the cursor or erase the already printed symbols?\n\nA word here is a contiguous sequence of latin letters bordered by spaces, punctuation signs and line/text beginnings/ends.

It is obvious that he can pay for 10 shovels without any change (by paying the requied amount of 10-burle coins and not using the coin of *r* burles). But perhaps he can buy fewer shovels and pay without any change. Note that Polycarp should buy at least one shovel.\nInput specification: The single line of input contains two integers *k* and *r* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=1000, 1<=\u2264<=*r*<=\u2264<=9)\u00a0\u2014 the price of one shovel and the denomination of the coin in Polycarp's pocket that is different from \"10-burle coins\". \n\nRemember that he has an unlimited number of coins in the denomination of 10, that is, Polycarp has enough money to buy any number of shovels.. Output specification: Print the required minimum number of shovels Polycarp has to buy so that he can pay for them without any change.\nDemo input: ['117 3\\n', '237 7\\n', '15 2\\n'], Demo output: ['9\\n', '1\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: In the first example Polycarp can buy 9 shovels and pay 9\u00b7117\u2009=\u20091053 burles. Indeed, he can pay this sum by using 10-burle coins and one 3-burle coin. He can't buy fewer shovels without any change.\n\nIn the second example it is enough for Polycarp to buy one shovel.\n\nIn the third example Polycarp should buy two shovels and pay 2\u00b715\u2009=\u200930 burles. It is obvious that he can pay this sum without any change."}]}}

Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap).\n\nIt turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth.

When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again. \n\nUnhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her.

That's why she decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that the viability of no tooth becomes negative. \n\nAs Valerie is not good at mathematics, she asked you to help her to find out the total amount of crucians that she can consume for dinner.\n\nWe should remind you that while eating one crucian Valerie uses exactly one row of teeth and the viability of each tooth from this row decreases by one.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000,<=0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 total amount of Valerie's teeth, amount of tooth rows and amount of crucians in Valerie's portion for dinner.

For example, in C++ you've got to use the fflush(stdout) function, in Java \u2014 call System.out.flush(), and in Pascal \u2014 flush(output).\n\nBulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls or Bulls and Cleots) is an old code-breaking paper and pencil game for two players, predating the similar commercially marketed board game Mastermind.\n\nOn a sheet of paper, the first player thinks a secret string. This string consists only of digits and has the length 4. The digits in the string must be all different, no two or more equal digits are allowed.\n\nThen the second player tries to guess his opponent's string. For every guess the first player gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are on their right positions, they are \"bulls\", if on different positions, they are \"cows\". Thus a response is a pair of numbers \u2014 the number of \"bulls\" and the number of \"cows\". A try can contain equal digits.\n\nMore formally, let's the secret string is *s* and the second player are trying to guess it with a string *x*. The number of \"bulls\" is a number of such positions *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=4) where *s*[*i*]<==<=*x*[*i*]. The number of \"cows\" is a number of such digits *c* that *s* contains *c* in the position *i* (i.e. *s*[*i*]<==<=*c*), *x* contains *c*, but *x*[*i*]<=\u2260<=*c*.\n\nFor example, the secret string is \"0427\", the opponent's try is \"0724\", then the answer is 2 bulls and 2 cows (the bulls are \"0\" and \"2\", the cows are \"4\" and \"7\"). If the secret string is \"0123\", the opponent's try is \"0330\", then the answer is 1 bull and 1 cow.\n\nIn this problem you are to guess the string *s* that the system has chosen. You only know that the chosen string consists of 4 distinct digits.\n\nYou can make queries to the testing system, each query is the output of a single 4-digit string. The answer to the query is the number of bulls and number of cows. If the system's response equals \"4 0\", that means the interaction with your problem is over and the program must terminate. That is possible for two reasons \u2014 the program either guessed the number *x* or made an invalid action (for example, printed letters instead of digits).\n\nYour program is allowed to do at most 7 queries.\n\nYou can hack solutions of other participants providing a 4-digit string containing distinct digits \u2014 the secret string.\nInput specification: To read answers to the queries, the program must use the standard input.\n\nThe program will receive pairs of non-negative integers in the input, one pair per line. The first number in a pair is a number of bulls and the second one is a number of cows of the string *s* and the string *x**i* printed by your program. If the system response equals \"4 0\", then your solution should terminate.\n\nThe testing system will let your program read the *i*-th pair of integers from the input only after your program displays the corresponding system query in the output: prints value *x**i* in a single line and executes operation flush.. Output specification: The program must use the standard output to print queries.\n\nYour program must output requests \u2014 4-digit strings *x*1,<=*x*2,<=..., one per line. After the output of each line the program must execute flush operation. The program should read the answer to the query from the standard input.\n\nYour program is allowed to do at most 7 queries.\nDemo input: ['0 1\\n2 0\\n1 1\\n0 4\\n2 1\\n4 0\\n'], Demo output: ['8000\\n0179\\n3159\\n3210\\n0112\\n0123']\nNote: The secret string *s* in the example is \"0123\"."}]}}

The grandmother has a large garden, which can be represented as a rectangle 1<=\u00d7<=*n* in size, when viewed from above. This rectangle is divided into *n* equal square sections. The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.\n\nCreating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section. At that, the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section. That is, for example, the garden can be represented by a 1<=\u00d7<=5 rectangle, where the section heights are equal to 4, 2, 3, 3, 2. Then if we create an artificial rain over any of the sections with the height of 3, the water will flow over all the sections, except the ones with the height of 4.

He will eat all your cookies unless you can demonstrate your mathematical skills. To test you, Limak is going to give you a puzzle to solve.\n\nIt's a well-known fact that Limak, as every bear, owns a set of numbers. You know some information about the set:\n -  The elements of the set are distinct positive integers. -  The number of elements in the set is *n*. The number *n* is divisible by 5. -  All elements are between 1 and *b*, inclusive: bears don't know numbers greater than *b*. -  For each *r* in {0,<=1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, the set contains exactly  elements that give remainder *r* when divided by 5. (That is, there are  elements divisible by 5,  elements of the form 5*k*<=+<=1,  elements of the form 5*k*<=+<=2, and so on.) \nLimak smiles mysteriously and gives you *q* hints about his set. The *i*-th hint is the following sentence: \"If you only look at elements that are between 1 and *upTo**i*, inclusive, you will find exactly *quantity**i* such elements in my set.\"\n\nIn a moment Limak will tell you the actual puzzle, but something doesn't seem right... That smile was very strange. You start to think about a possible reason. Maybe Limak cheated you? Or is he a fair grizzly bear?\n\nGiven *n*, *b*, *q* and hints, check whether Limak can be fair, i.e. there exists at least one set satisfying the given conditions.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the elements of array. \n\nThe third line contains integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs. Separate the numbers by spaces.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nDemo input: ['2\\n1 2\\n1\\n1\\n', '2\\n2 1\\n1\\n1\\n', '3\\n3 1 2\\n3\\n1 2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['1 2\\n', '2 1\\n', '6 6\\n']\nNote: In the first sample Vasya's approach will make one comparison (it starts with the 1-st element and immediately finds the required number), and Petya's approach makes two comparisons (first he compares with the 2-nd array element, doesn't find the search item and compares with the 1-st element).\n\nIn the second sample, on the contrary, Vasya's approach will need two comparisons (first with 1-st element, and then with the 2-nd), and Petya's approach will find the required value in one comparison (the first comparison with the 2-nd element)."}]}}

He wants to shoot her with his heart arrow but he needs to know the distance between him and the girl to make his shot accurate.\n\nBarney asked the bar tender Carl about this distance value, but Carl was so busy talking to the customers so he wrote the distance value (it's a real number) on a napkin.

Formally, if Mike chooses a sequence *p*1<==<=1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**k* then for each 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*k* satisfying *p**i*<=+<=1<==<=*a**p**i* and *a**p**i*<=\u2260<=*p**i* Mike will spend only 1 unit of energy instead of |*p**i*<=-<=*p**i*<=+<=1| walking from the intersection *p**i* to intersection *p**i*<=+<=1. For example, if Mike chooses a sequence *p*1<==<=1,<=*p*2<==<=*a**p*1,<=*p*3<==<=*a**p*2,<=...,<=*p**k*<==<=*a**p**k*<=-<=1, he spends exactly *k*<=-<=1 units of total energy walking around them.\n\nBefore going on his adventure, Mike asks you to find the minimum amount of energy required to reach each of the intersections from his home. Formally, for each 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n* Mike is interested in finding minimum possible total energy of some sequence *p*1<==<=1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**k*<==<=*i*.\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of Mike's city intersection.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (*i*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n* , , describing shortcuts of Mike's city, allowing to walk from intersection *i* to intersection *a**i* using only 1 unit of energy.

Write a python script for the following problem: Vasya studies divisibility rules at school. Here are some of them:\n-  Divisibility by 2. A number is divisible by 2 if and only if its last digit is divisible by 2 or in other words, is even.-  Divisibility by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.-  Divisibility by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if and only if its last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4.-  Divisibility by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if and only if its last digit equals 5 or 0.-  Divisibility by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by 2 and 3 simultaneously (that is, if the last digit is even and the sum of all digits is divisible by 3).-  Divisibility by 7. Vasya doesn't know such divisibility rule.-  Divisibility by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if and only if its last three digits form a number that is divisible by 8.-  Divisibility by 9. A number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.-  Divisibility by 10. A number is divisible by 10 if and only if its last digit is a zero.-  Divisibility by 11. A number is divisible by 11 if and only if the sum of digits on its odd positions either equals to the sum of digits on the even positions, or they differ in a number that is divisible by 11.\nVasya got interested by the fact that some divisibility rules resemble each other. In fact, to check a number's divisibility by 2, 4, 5, 8 and 10 it is enough to check fulfiling some condition for one or several last digits. Vasya calls such rules the 2-type rules.\n\nIf checking divisibility means finding a sum of digits and checking whether the sum is divisible by the given number, then Vasya calls this rule the 3-type rule (because it works for numbers 3 and 9).\n\nIf we need to find the difference between the sum of digits on odd and even positions and check whether the difference is divisible by the given divisor, this rule is called the 11-type rule (it works for number 11).\n\nIn some cases we should divide the divisor into several factors and check whether rules of different types (2-type, 3-type or 11-type) work there. For example, for number 6 we check 2-type and 3-type rules, for number 66 we check all three types. Such mixed divisibility rules are called 6-type rules. \n\nAnd finally, there are some numbers for which no rule works: neither 2-type, nor 3-type, nor 11-type, nor 6-type. The least such number is number 7, so we'll say that in such cases the mysterious 7-type rule works, the one that Vasya hasn't discovered yet. \n\nVasya's dream is finding divisibility rules for all possible numbers. He isn't going to stop on the decimal numbers only. As there are quite many numbers, ha can't do it all by himself. Vasya asked you to write a program that determines the divisibility rule type in the *b*-based notation for the given divisor *d*.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *b* and *d* (2<=\u2264<=*b*,<=*d*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the notation system base and the divisor. Both numbers are given in the decimal notation.. Output specification: On the first output line print the type of the rule in the *b*-based notation system, where the divisor is *d*: \"2-type\", \"3-type\", \"11-type\", \"6-type\" or \"7-type\". If there are several such types, print the one that goes earlier in the given sequence. If a number belongs to the 2-type, print on the second line the least number of the last *b*-based digits that we will need to use to check the divisibility.\nDemo input: ['10 10\\n', '2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['2-type\\n1\\n', '11-type\\n']\nNote: The divisibility rule for number 3 in binary notation looks as follows: \"A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits that occupy the even places differs from the sum of digits that occupy the odd places, in a number that is divisible by 3\". That's an 11-type rule. For example, 21<sub class=\"lower-index\">10</sub>\u2009=\u200910101<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>. For it the sum of digits on odd positions equals 1\u2009+\u20091\u2009+\u20091\u2009=\u20093, an on even positions \u2014 0\u2009+\u20090\u2009=\u20090. The rule works and the number is divisible by 3. \n\nIn some notations a number can fit into the 3-type rule and the 11-type rule. In this case the correct answer is \"3-type\"."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes.

So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091).

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes. The second line contains integers *x**c* and *y**c* \u2014 the initial square's coordinates (1<=\u2264<=*x**c*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y**c*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nThe third line contains an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the number of vectors. Then follow *k* lines, each of them contains two integers *dx**i* and *dy**i* (|*dx**i*|,<=|*dy**i*|<=\u2264<=109,<=|*dx*|<=+<=|*dy*|<=\u2265<=1).. Output specification: Print the single number \u2014 the number of steps Vasya had made.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++.

So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091). He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092).

As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too.

Write a python script for the following problem: All cinema halls in Berland are rectangles with *K* rows of *K* seats each, and *K* is an odd number. Rows and seats are numbered from 1 to *K*. For safety reasons people, who come to the box office to buy tickets, are not allowed to choose seats themselves. Formerly the choice was made by a cashier, but now this is the responsibility of a special seating program. It was found out that the large majority of Berland's inhabitants go to the cinema in order to watch a movie, that's why they want to sit as close to the hall center as possible. Moreover, a company of *M* people, who come to watch a movie, want necessarily to occupy *M* successive seats in one row. Let's formulate the algorithm, according to which the program chooses seats and sells tickets. As the request for *M* seats comes, the program should determine the row number *x* and the segment [*y**l*,<=*y**r*] of the seats numbers in this row, where *y**r*<=-<=*y**l*<=+<=1<==<=*M*. From all such possible variants as a final result the program should choose the one with the minimum function value of total seats remoteness from the center. Say,  \u2014 the row and the seat numbers of the most \"central\" seat. Then the function value of seats remoteness from the hall center is . If the amount of minimum function values is more than one, the program should choose the one that is closer to the screen (i.e. the row number *x* is lower). If the variants are still multiple, it should choose the one with the minimum *y**l*.

You can clearly see that there exists a unique shortest path between any two intersections.\n\nInitially anyone can pass any road for free.

In other words, difficulty equals the maximum distance between two holds that are adjacent in height.\n\nToday Mike decided to cover the track with holds hanging on heights *a*1, ..., *a**n*. To make the problem harder, Mike decided to remove one hold, that is, remove one element of the sequence (for example, if we take the sequence (1,<=2,<=3,<=4,<=5) and remove the third element from it, we obtain the sequence (1,<=2,<=4,<=5)).

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, on a programming lesson little Petya showed how quickly he can create files and folders on the computer. But he got soon fed up with this activity, and he decided to do a much more useful thing. He decided to calculate what folder contains most subfolders (including nested folders, nested folders of nested folders, and so on) and what folder contains most files (including the files in the subfolders).\n\nMore formally, the subfolders of the folder are all its directly nested folders and the subfolders of these nested folders. The given folder is not considered the subfolder of itself. A file is regarded as lying in a folder, if and only if it either lies directly in this folder, or lies in some subfolder of the folder.\n\nFor a better understanding of how to count subfolders and files for calculating the answer, see notes and answers to the samples.\n\nYou are given a few files that Petya has managed to create. The path to each file looks as follows:\n\n*diskName*:\\*folder*1\\*folder*2\\...\\ *folder**n*\\*fileName* \n-  *diskName* is single capital letter from the set {C,D,E,F,G}.-  *folder*1, ..., *folder**n* are folder names. Each folder name is nonempty sequence of lowercase Latin letters and digits from 0 to 9. (*n*<=\u2265<=1)-  *fileName* is a file name in the form of *name*.*extension*, where the *name* and the *extension* are nonempty sequences of lowercase Latin letters and digits from 0 to 9. \nIt is also known that there is no file whose path looks like *diskName*:\\*fileName*. That is, each file is stored in some folder, but there are no files directly in the root. Also let us assume that the disk root is not a folder.\n\nHelp Petya to find the largest number of subfolders, which can be in some folder, and the largest number of files that can be in some folder, counting all its subfolders.\nInput specification: Each line of input data contains the description of one file path. The length of each line does not exceed 100, and overall there are no more than 100 lines. It is guaranteed, that all the paths are correct and meet the above rules. It is also guaranteed, that there are no two completely equal lines. That is, each file is described exactly once.\n\nThere is at least one line in the input data.. Output specification: Print two space-separated numbers. The first one is the maximal number of possible subfolders in a folder (including nested folders, nested folders of nested folders, and so on). The second one is the maximal number of files in a folder (including nested files in subfolders). Note that the disks are not regarded as folders.\nDemo input: ['C:\\\\folder1\\\\file1.txt', 'C:\\\\folder1\\\\folder2\\\\folder3\\\\file1.txt\\nC:\\\\folder1\\\\folder2\\\\folder4\\\\file1.txt\\nD:\\\\folder1\\\\file1.txt\\n', 'C:\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file.txt\\nC:\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file\\\\file2\\\\file.txt'], Demo output: ['0 1', '3 2', '4 2']\nNote: In the first sample we have one folder on the \"C\" disk. It has no subfolders, which is why the first number in the answer is 0. But this folder contains one file, so the second number of the answer is 1.\n\nIn the second sample we have several different folders. Consider the \"folder1\" folder on the \"C\" disk. This folder directly contains one folder, \"folder2\". The \"folder2\" folder contains two more folders \u2014 \"folder3\" and \"folder4\". Thus, the \"folder1\" folder on the \"C\" drive has exactly 3 subfolders. Also this folder contains two files, even though they do not lie directly in the folder, but they are located in subfolders of \"folder1\".\n\nIn the third example we see that the names of some folders and some subfolders are identical. Consider the \"file\" folder, which lies directly on the \"C\" disk. That folder contains another \"file\" folder, which in turn contains another \"file\" folder, which contains two more folders, \"file\" and \"file2\". Thus, the \"file\" folder, which lies directly on the \"C\" disk, contains 4 subfolders."}]}}

Help Petya restore the original song.\nInput specification: The input consists of a single non-empty string, consisting only of uppercase English letters, the string's length doesn't exceed 200 characters. It is guaranteed that before Vasya remixed the song, no word contained substring \"WUB\" in it; Vasya didn't change the word order. It is also guaranteed that initially the song had at least one word.. Output specification: Print the words of the initial song that Vasya used to make a dubsteb remix. Separate the words with a space.\nDemo input: ['WUBWUBABCWUB\\n', 'WUBWEWUBAREWUBWUBTHEWUBCHAMPIONSWUBMYWUBFRIENDWUB\\n'], Demo output: ['ABC ', 'WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS MY FRIEND ']\nNote: In the first sample: \"WUBWUBABCWUB\" = \"WUB\" + \"WUB\" + \"ABC\" + \"WUB\". That means that the song originally consisted of a single word \"ABC\", and all words \"WUB\" were added by Vasya.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya added a single word \"WUB\" between all neighbouring words, in the beginning and in the end, except for words \"ARE\" and \"THE\" \u2014 between them Vasya added two \"WUB\"."}]}}

In the output section below you will see the information about flushing the output.\n\nBear Limak thinks of some hidden number\u00a0\u2014 an integer from interval [2,<=100]. Your task is to say if the hidden number is prime or composite.\n\nInteger *x*<=&gt;<=1 is called prime if it has exactly two distinct divisors, 1 and *x*. If integer *x*<=&gt;<=1 is not prime, it's called composite.\n\nYou can ask up to 20 queries about divisors of the hidden number. In each query you should print an integer from interval [2,<=100]. The system will answer \"yes\" if your integer is a divisor of the hidden number. Otherwise, the answer will be \"no\".\n\nFor example, if the hidden number is 14 then the system will answer \"yes\" only if you print 2, 7 or 14.\n\nWhen you are done asking queries, print \"prime\" or \"composite\" and terminate your program.\n\nYou will get the Wrong Answer verdict if you ask more than 20 queries, or if you print an integer not from the range [2,<=100]. Also, you will get the Wrong Answer verdict if the printed answer isn't correct.\n\nYou will get the Idleness Limit Exceeded verdict if you don't print anything (but you should) or if you forget about flushing the output (more info below).\nInput specification: After each query you should read one string from the input. It will be \"yes\" if the printed integer is a divisor of the hidden number, and \"no\" otherwise.. Output specification: Up to 20 times you can ask a query\u00a0\u2014 print an integer from interval [2,<=100] in one line. You have to both print the end-of-line character and flush the output. After flushing you should read a response from the input.\n\nIn any moment you can print the answer \"prime\" or \"composite\" (without the quotes). After that, flush the output and terminate your program.\n\nTo flush you can use (just after printing an integer and end-of-line): \n -  fflush(stdout) in C++; -  System.out.flush() in Java; -  stdout.flush() in Python; -  flush(output) in Pascal; -  See the documentation for other languages. \nHacking. To hack someone, as the input you should print the hidden number\u00a0\u2014 one integer from the interval [2,<=100]. Of course, his/her solution won't be able to read the hidden number from the input.\nDemo input: ['yes\\nno\\nyes\\n', 'no\\nyes\\nno\\nno\\nno\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n80\\n5\\ncomposite\\n', '58\\n59\\n78\\n78\\n2\\nprime\\n']\nNote: The hidden number in the first query is 30.

Thus, it must be composite. Note that it isn't necessary to know the exact value of the hidden number. In this test, the hidden number is 30.\n\n<img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/35c6952617fa94ec3e0ea8e63aa1c3c49b3ba420.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\n59 is a divisor of the hidden number. In the interval [2,\u2009100] there is only one number with this divisor. The hidden number must be 59, which is prime. Note that the answer is known even after the second query and you could print it then and terminate. Though, it isn't forbidden to ask unnecessary queries (unless you exceed the limit of 20 queries)."}]}}

Sonya will give a number to each robot (they can be either same or different) and run them. When a robot is running, it is moving toward to another robot, reading numbers in the row. When a robot is reading a number that is equal to the number that was given to that robot, it will turn off and stay in the same position.\n\nSonya does not want robots to break, so she will give such numbers that robots will stop before they meet.

In other words, she wants to know the number of pairs ($p$, $q$), where she will give $p$ to the first robot and $q$ to the second one. Pairs ($p_i$, $q_i$) and ($p_j$, $q_j$) are different if $p_i\\neq p_j$ or $q_i\\neq q_j$.\n\nUnfortunately, Sonya is busy fixing robots that broke after a failed launch.

Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up \u2014 who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that\u2019s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player wins.

For example, \"noon\", \"testset\" and \"a\" are all palindromes, while \"test\" and \"kitayuta\" are not.\n\nYou can choose any lowercase English letter, and insert it to any position of *s*, possibly to the beginning or the end of *s*. You have to insert a letter even if the given string is already a palindrome.\n\nIf it is possible to insert one lowercase English letter into *s* so that the resulting string will be a palindrome, print the string after the insertion. Otherwise, print \"NA\" (without quotes, case-sensitive). In case there is more than one palindrome that can be obtained, you are allowed to print any of them.\nInput specification: The only line of the input contains a string *s* (1<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=10). Each character in *s* is a lowercase English letter.. Output specification: If it is possible to turn *s* into a palindrome by inserting one lowercase English letter, print the resulting string in a single line. Otherwise, print \"NA\" (without quotes, case-sensitive). In case there is more than one solution, any of them will be accepted.\nDemo input: ['revive\\n', 'ee\\n', 'kitayuta\\n'], Demo output: ['reviver\\n', 'eye', 'NA\\n']\nNote: For the first sample, insert 'r' to the end of \"revive\" to obtain a palindrome \"reviver\".\n\nFor the second sample, there is more than one solution. For example, \"eve\" will also be accepted.\n\nFor the third sample, it is not possible to turn \"kitayuta\" into a palindrome by just inserting one letter."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Little Artem has invented a time machine! He could go anywhere in time, but all his thoughts of course are with computer science. He wants to apply this time machine to a well-known data structure: multiset.\n\nArtem wants to create a basic multiset of integers. He wants these structure to support operations of three types:\n 1.  Add integer to the multiset. Note that the difference between set and multiset is that multiset may store several instances of one integer. 1.  Remove integer from the multiset. Only one instance of this integer is removed. Artem doesn't want to handle any exceptions, so he assumes that every time remove operation is called, that integer is presented in the multiset. 1.  Count the number of instances of the given integer that are stored in the multiset. \nBut what about time machine? Artem doesn't simply apply operations to the multiset one by one, he now travels to different moments of time and apply his operation there. Consider the following example.\n -  First Artem adds integer 5 to the multiset at the 1-st moment of time. -  Then Artem adds integer 3 to the multiset at the moment 5. -  Then Artem asks how many 5 are there in the multiset at moment 6. The answer is 1. -  Then Artem returns back in time and asks how many integers 3 are there in the set at moment 4. Since 3 was added only at moment 5, the number of integers 3 at moment 4 equals to 0. -  Then Artem goes back in time again and removes 5 from the multiset at moment 3. -  Finally Artyom asks at moment 7 how many integers 5 are there in the set. The result is 0, since we have removed 5 at the moment 3. \nNote that Artem dislikes exceptions so much that he assures that after each change he makes all delete operations are applied only to element that is present in the multiset. The answer to the query of the third type is computed at the moment Artem makes the corresponding query and are not affected in any way by future changes he makes.\n\nHelp Artem implement time travellers multiset.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of Artem's queries.\n\nThen follow *n* lines with queries descriptions.

Write a python script for the following problem: In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.\n\nThere are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.\n\nOfficer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:\n -  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$; -  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. \nFor example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\n\nThe structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.\n\nFormally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.\n\nBerland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.\n\nSuppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ \u2014 one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.\n\nLet's look at the following example:\n\nIf officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.\n\nIf officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.\n\nTo answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.\n\nYou should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i &lt; i$), where $p_i$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $i$. The commander has index $1$ and doesn't have any superiors.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query is given as a pair ($u_i, k_i$) ($1 \\le u_i, k_i \\le n$), where $u_i$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $k_i$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence.. Output specification: Print $q$ numbers, where the $i$-th number is the officer at the position $k_i$ in the list which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if it starts spreading from officer $u_i$. Print \"-1\" if the number of officers which receive the command is less than $k_i$.\n\nYou should process queries independently. They do not affect each other.\nDemo input: ['9 6\\n1 1 1 3 5 3 5 7\\n3 1\\n1 5\\n3 4\\n7 3\\n1 8\\n1 9\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n6\\n8\\n-1\\n9\\n4\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Almost all cells of the field are white and only some of them are black. Currently Gerald is finishing a game of giant chess against his friend Pollard.

Gerald is so confident of victory that he became interested, in how many ways can he win?\n\nThe pawn, which Gerald has got left can go in two ways: one cell down or one cell to the right. In addition, it can not go to the black cells, otherwise the Gerald still loses. There are no other pawns or pieces left on the field, so that, according to the rules of giant chess Gerald moves his pawn until the game is over, and Pollard is just watching this process.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains three integers: *h*,<=*w*,<=*n* \u2014 the sides of the board and the number of black cells (1<=\u2264<=*h*,<=*w*<=\u2264<=105,<=1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2000). \n\nNext *n* lines contain the description of black cells.

The passages are designed in such a way that it should be possible to get from any location to any other location.\n\nOf course, some passages should be guarded by the monsters (if you just can go everywhere without any difficulties, then it's not fun, right?). Some crucial passages will be guarded by really fearsome monsters, requiring the hero to prepare for battle and designing his own tactics of defeating them (commonly these kinds of monsters are called bosses). And your friend wants you to help him place these bosses.\n\nThe game will start in location $s$ and end in location $t$, but these locations are not chosen yet. After choosing these locations, your friend will place a boss in each passage such that it is impossible to get from $s$ to $t$ without using this passage. Your friend wants to place as much bosses as possible (because more challenges means more fun, right?), so he asks you to help him determine the maximum possible number of bosses, considering that any location can be chosen as $s$ or as $t$.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$, $n - 1 \\le m \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of locations and passages, respectively.\n\nThen $m$ lines follow, each containing two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1 \\le x, y \\le n$, $x \\ne y$) describing the endpoints of one of the passages.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is no pair of locations directly connected by two or more passages, and that any location is reachable from any other location..

Write a python script for the following problem: Petya got interested in grammar on his third year in school. He invented his own language called Petya's. Petya wanted to create a maximally simple language that would be enough to chat with friends, that's why all the language's grammar can be described with the following set of rules:\n-  There are three parts of speech: the adjective, the noun, the verb. Each word in his language is an adjective, noun or verb. -  There are two genders: masculine and feminine. Each word in his language has gender either masculine or feminine. -  Masculine adjectives end with -lios, and feminine adjectives end with -liala. -  Masculine nouns end with -etr, and feminime nouns end with -etra. -  Masculine verbs end with -initis, and feminime verbs end with -inites. -  Thus, each word in the Petya's language has one of the six endings, given above. There are no other endings in Petya's language. -  It is accepted that the whole word consists of an ending. That is, words \"lios\", \"liala\", \"etr\" and so on belong to the Petya's language. -  There aren't any punctuation marks, grammatical tenses, singular/plural forms or other language complications. -  A sentence is either exactly one valid language word or exactly one statement. \nStatement is any sequence of the Petya's language, that satisfy both conditions:\n-  Words in statement follow in the following order (from the left to the right): zero or more adjectives followed by exactly one noun followed by zero or more verbs. -  All words in the statement should have the same gender.\nAfter Petya's friend Vasya wrote instant messenger (an instant messaging program) that supported the Petya's language, Petya wanted to add spelling and grammar checking to the program. As Vasya was in the country and Petya didn't feel like waiting, he asked you to help him with this problem.

At first night he received embosser and was to take stock of the whole exposition.\n\nEmbosser is a special devise that allows to \"print\" the text of a plastic tape. Text is printed sequentially, character by character. The device consists of a wheel with a lowercase English letters written in a circle, static pointer to the current letter and a button that print the chosen letter. At one move it's allowed to rotate the alphabetic wheel one step clockwise or counterclockwise. Initially, static pointer points to letter 'a'. Other letters are located as shown on the picture:\n\nAfter Grigoriy add new item to the base he has to print its name on the plastic tape and attach it to the corresponding exhibit. It's not required to return the wheel to its initial position with pointer on the letter 'a'.\n\nOur hero is afraid that some exhibits may become alive and start to attack him, so he wants to print the names as fast as possible.

There was his birthday recently. *k* of his friends came to him to congratulate him, and each of them presented to him a string *s**i* having the same length *n*. We denote the beauty of the *i*-th string by *a**i*. It can happen that *a**i* is negative\u00a0\u2014 that means that Santa doesn't find this string beautiful at all.\n\nSanta Claus is crazy about palindromes. He is thinking about the following question: what is the maximum possible total beauty of a palindrome which can be obtained by concatenating some (possibly all) of the strings he has? Each present can be used at most once. Note that all strings have the same length *n*.\n\nRecall that a palindrome is a string that doesn't change after one reverses it.\n\nSince the empty string is a palindrome too, the answer can't be negative. Even if all *a**i*'s are negative, Santa can obtain the empty string.\nInput specification: The first line contains two positive integers *k* and *n* divided by space and denoting the number of Santa friends and the length of every string they've presented, respectively (1<=\u2264<=*k*,<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000; *n*\u00b7*k*\u00a0<=\u2264<=100<=000).\n\n*k* lines follow.

Write a python script for the following problem: The winner of the card game popular in Berland \"Berlogging\" is determined according to the following rules. If at the end of the game there is only one player with the maximum number of points, he is the winner. The situation becomes more difficult if the number of such players is more than one. During each round a player gains or loses a particular number of points. In the course of the game the number of points is registered in the line \"name score\", where name is a player's name, and score is the number of points gained in this round, which is an integer number. If score is negative, this means that the player has lost in the round. So, if two or more players have the maximum number of points (say, it equals to *m*) at the end of the game, than wins the one of them who scored at least *m* points first.

Write a python script for the following problem: The whole world got obsessed with robots,and to keep pace with the progress, great Berland's programmer Draude decided to build his own robot. He was working hard at the robot. He taught it to walk the shortest path from one point to another, to record all its movements, but like in many Draude's programs, there was a bug \u2014 the robot didn't always walk the shortest path. Fortunately, the robot recorded its own movements correctly. Now Draude wants to find out when his robot functions wrong. Heh, if Draude only remembered the map of the field, where he tested the robot, he would easily say if the robot walked in the right direction or not. But the field map was lost never to be found, that's why he asks you to find out if there exist at least one map, where the path recorded by the robot is the shortest.\n\nThe map is an infinite checkered field, where each square is either empty, or contains an obstruction. It is also known that the robot never tries to run into the obstruction. By the recorded robot's movements find out if there exist at least one such map, that it is possible to choose for the robot a starting square (the starting square should be empty) such that when the robot moves from this square its movements coincide with the recorded ones (the robot doesn't run into anything, moving along empty squares only), and the path from the starting square to the end one is the shortest.\n\nIn one movement the robot can move into the square (providing there are no obstrutions in this square) that has common sides with the square the robot is currently in.\nInput specification: The first line of the input file contains the recording of the robot's movements. This recording is a non-empty string, consisting of uppercase Latin letters L, R, U and D, standing for movements left, right, up and down respectively. The length of the string does not exceed 100..

Write a python script for the following problem: Kostya is a progamer specializing in the discipline of Dota 2. Valve Corporation, the developer of this game, has recently released a new patch which turned the balance of the game upside down. Kostya, as the captain of the team, realizes that the greatest responsibility lies on him, so he wants to resort to the analysis of innovations patch from the mathematical point of view to choose the best heroes for his team in every game.\n\nA Dota 2 match involves two teams, each of them must choose some heroes that the players of the team are going to play for, and it is forbidden to choose the same hero several times, even in different teams. In large electronic sports competitions where Kostya's team is going to participate, the matches are held in the Captains Mode. In this mode the captains select the heroes by making one of two possible actions in a certain, predetermined order: pick or ban.\n -  To pick a hero for the team. After the captain picks, the picked hero goes to his team (later one of a team members will play it) and can no longer be selected by any of the teams. -  To ban a hero. After the ban the hero is not sent to any of the teams, but it still can no longer be selected by any of the teams. \nThe team captain may miss a pick or a ban. If he misses a pick, a random hero is added to his team from those that were available at that moment, and if he misses a ban, no hero is banned, as if there was no ban.\n\nKostya has already identified the strength of all the heroes based on the new patch fixes. Of course, Kostya knows the order of picks and bans. The strength of a team is the sum of the strengths of the team's heroes and both teams that participate in the match seek to maximize the difference in strengths in their favor. Help Kostya determine what team, the first one or the second one, has advantage in the match, and how large the advantage is.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of heroes in Dota 2.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *s*1, *s*2, ..., *s**n* (1<=\u2264<=*s**i*<=\u2264<=106)\u00a0\u2014 the strengths of all the heroes.\n\nThe third line contains a single integer *m* (2<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*min*(*n*,<=20))\u00a0\u2014 the number of actions the captains of the team must perform.\n\nNext *m* lines look like \"*action*\u00a0*team*\", where *action* is the needed action: a pick (represented as a \"p\") or a ban (represented as a \"b\"), and *team* is the number of the team that needs to perform the action (number 1 or 2).\n\nIt is guaranteed that each team makes at least one pick. Besides, each team has the same number of picks and the same number of bans..

Write a python script for the following problem: After years of hard work scientists invented an absolutely new e-reader display.

For that very reason the developers decided to leave the e-readers' software to programmers.\n\nThe display is represented by *n*<=\u00d7<=*n* square of pixels, each of which can be either black or white. The display rows are numbered with integers from 1 to *n* upside down, the columns are numbered with integers from 1 to *n* from the left to the right. The display can perform commands like \"*x*,<=*y*\". When a traditional display fulfills such command, it simply inverts a color of (*x*,<=*y*), where *x* is the row number and *y* is the column number. But in our new display every pixel that belongs to at least one of the segments (*x*,<=*x*)<=-<=(*x*,<=*y*) and (*y*,<=*y*)<=-<=(*x*,<=*y*) (both ends of both segments are included) inverts a color.\n\nFor example, if initially a display 5<=\u00d7<=5 in size is absolutely white, then the sequence of commands (1,<=4), (3,<=5), (5,<=1), (3,<=3) leads to the following changes:\n\nYou are an e-reader software programmer and you should calculate minimal number of commands needed to display the picture.

Asterix supposed that that's the password that opens the temple and read the string aloud. However, nothing happened. Then Asterix supposed that a password is some substring *t* of the string *s*.\n\nPrefix supposed that the substring *t* is the beginning of the string *s*; Suffix supposed that the substring *t* should be the end of the string *s*; and Obelix supposed that *t* should be located somewhere inside the string *s*, that is, *t* is neither its beginning, nor its end.\n\nAsterix chose the substring *t* so as to please all his companions. Besides, from all acceptable variants Asterix chose the longest one (as Asterix loves long strings). When Asterix read the substring *t* aloud, the temple doors opened. \n\nYou know the string *s*. Find the substring *t* or determine that such substring does not exist and all that's been written above is just a nice legend.\nInput specification: You are given the string *s* whose length can vary from 1 to 106 (inclusive), consisting of small Latin letters.. Output specification: Print the string *t*. If a suitable *t* string does not exist, then print \"Just a legend\" without the quotes.\nDemo input: ['fixprefixsuffix\\n', 'abcdabc\\n'], Demo output: ['fix', 'Just a legend']\nNote: none"}]}}

And, as the boy loves hockey very much, even more than physics, he forgot to do the homework. Specifically, he forgot to complete his physics tasks. Next day the teacher got very angry at Vasya and decided to teach him a lesson. He gave the lazy student a seemingly easy task: You are given an idle body in space and the forces that affect it. The body can be considered as a material point with coordinates (0; 0; 0). Vasya had only to answer whether it is in equilibrium. \"Piece of cake\" \u2014 thought Vasya, we need only to check if the sum of all vectors is equal to 0. So, Vasya began to solve the problem.

Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis.

Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective.

Write a python script for the following problem: Little boy Gerald studies at school which is quite far from his house. That's why he has to go there by bus every day. The way from home to school is represented by a segment of a straight line; the segment contains exactly *n*<=+<=1 bus stops. All of them are numbered with integers from 0 to *n* in the order in which they follow from Gerald's home. The bus stop by Gerald's home has number 0 and the bus stop by the school has number *n*.\n\nThere are *m* buses running between the house and the school: the *i*-th bus goes from stop *s**i* to *t**i* (*s**i*<=&lt;<=*t**i*), visiting all the intermediate stops in the order in which they follow on the segment. Besides, Gerald's no idiot and he wouldn't get off the bus until it is still possible to ride on it closer to the school (obviously, getting off would be completely pointless). In other words, Gerald can get on the *i*-th bus on any stop numbered from *s**i* to *t**i*<=-<=1 inclusive, but he can get off the *i*-th bus only on the bus stop *t**i*.\n\nGerald can't walk between the bus stops and he also can't move in the direction from the school to the house.\n\nGerald wants to know how many ways he has to get from home to school. Tell him this number. Two ways are considered different if Gerald crosses some segment between the stops on different buses. As the number of ways can be too much, find the remainder of a division of this number by 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers: *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=109,<=0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105). Then follow *m* lines each containing two integers *s**i*,<=*t**i*. They are the numbers of starting stops and end stops of the buses (0<=\u2264<=*s**i*<=&lt;<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=*n*).. Output specification: Print the only number \u2014 the number of ways to get to the school modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\nDemo input: ['2 2\\n0 1\\n1 2\\n', '3 2\\n0 1\\n1 2\\n', '5 5\\n0 1\\n0 2\\n0 3\\n0 4\\n0 5\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '0\\n', '16\\n']\nNote: The first test has the only variant to get to school: first on bus number one to the bus stop number one; then on bus number two to the bus stop number two.\n\nIn the second test no bus goes to the third bus stop, where the school is positioned. Thus, the correct answer is 0.\n\nIn the third test Gerald can either get or not on any of the first four buses to get closer to the school. Thus, the correct answer is 2<sup class=\"upper-index\">4</sup>\u2009=\u200916."}]}}

As there are exactly *n* houses in Ultimate Thule, Vova wants the city to have exactly *n* pipes, each such pipe should be connected to the water supply. A pipe can be connected to the water supply if there's water flowing out of it. Initially Vova has only one pipe with flowing water. Besides, Vova has several splitters.\n\nA splitter is a construction that consists of one input (it can be connected to a water pipe) and *x* output pipes. When a splitter is connected to a water pipe, water flows from each output pipe. You can assume that the output pipes are ordinary pipes. For example, you can connect water supply to such pipe if there's water flowing out from it. At most one splitter can be connected to any water pipe.\n\nVova has one splitter of each kind: with 2, 3, 4, ..., *k* outputs. Help Vova use the minimum number of splitters to build the required pipeline or otherwise state that it's impossible.\n\nVova needs the pipeline to have exactly *n* pipes with flowing out water. Note that some of those pipes can be the output pipes of the splitters.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1018, 2<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=109).\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++.

However, Vasilisa the Wise does not know what the box's secret is, since she cannot open it again.

The example of a lock is given on the picture below.\n\nThe box is accompanied with 9 gems.

The box will only open after it is decorated with gems correctly: that is, each deepening in the lock should be filled with exactly one gem. Also, the sums of numbers in the square's rows, columns and two diagonals of the square should match the numbers written at the lock's edge.

A task can only be executed if all tasks it depends on have already completed.\n\nSome of the tasks in the graph can only be executed on a coprocessor, and the rest can only be executed on the main processor. In one coprocessor call you can send it a set of tasks which can only be executed on it. For each task of the set, all tasks on which it depends must be either already completed or be included in the set. The main processor starts the program execution and gets the results of tasks executed on the coprocessor automatically.\n\nFind the minimal number of coprocessor calls which are necessary to execute the given program.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *N* (1<=\u2264<=*N*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the total number of tasks given, and *M* (0<=\u2264<=*M*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the total number of dependencies between tasks.\n\nThe next line contains *N* space-separated integers . If *E**i*<==<=0, task *i* can only be executed on the main processor, otherwise it can only be executed on the coprocessor.\n\nThe next *M* lines describe the dependencies between tasks. Each line contains two space-separated integers *T*1 and *T*2 and means that task *T*1 depends on task *T*2 (*T*1<=\u2260<=*T*2). Tasks are indexed from 0 to *N*<=-<=1. All *M* pairs (*T*1,<=*T*2) are distinct. It is guaranteed that there are no circular dependencies between tasks.. Output specification: Output one line containing an integer \u2014 the minimal number of coprocessor calls necessary to execute the program.\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n0 1 0 1\\n0 1\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n', '4 3\\n1 1 1 0\\n0 1\\n0 2\\n3 0\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: In the first test, tasks 1 and 3 can only be executed on the coprocessor. The dependency graph is linear, so the tasks must be executed in order 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 0. You have to call coprocessor twice: first you call it for task 3, then you execute task 2 on the main processor, then you call it for for task 1, and finally you execute task 0 on the main processor.\n\nIn the second test, tasks 0, 1 and 2 can only be executed on the coprocessor. Tasks 1 and 2 have no dependencies, and task 0 depends on tasks 1 and 2, so all three tasks 0, 1 and 2 can be sent in one coprocessor call. After that task 3 is executed on the main processor."}]}}

One of its consequences is: the opening brackets are either the first character of the string or there is a space to the left of them.\n\nYou have a string that consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters, digits, characters \".,?!\"\" and spaces. It is guaranteed that this string is a correct OS Pindows command line string. Print all lexemes of this command line string. Consider the character \"\"\" to be used only in order to denote a single block of characters into one command line lexeme. In particular, the consequence is that the given string has got an even number of such characters.\nInput specification: The single line contains a non-empty string *s*. String *s* consists of at most 105 characters. Each character is either an uppercase or a lowercase English letter, or a digit, or one of the \".,?!\"\" signs, or a space.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given string is some correct command line string of the OS Pindows. It is guaranteed that the given command line string contains at least one lexeme.. Output specification: In the first line print the first lexeme, in the second line print the second one and so on. To make the output clearer, print the \"&lt;\" (less) character to the left of your lexemes and the \"&gt;\" (more) character to the right. Print the lexemes in the order in which they occur in the command.\n\nPlease, follow the given output format strictly. For more clarifications on the output format see the test samples.\nDemo input: ['\"RUn.exe O\" \"\" \"   2ne, \" two! . \" \"\\n', 'firstarg   second   \"\"    \\n'], Demo output: ['&lt;RUn.exe O&gt;\\n&lt;&gt;\\n&lt;   2ne, &gt;\\n&lt;two!&gt;\\n&lt;.&gt;\\n&lt; &gt;\\n', '&lt;firstarg&gt;\\n&lt;second&gt;\\n&lt;&gt;\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

The order number *i* has price *p**i*, direction *d**i* \u2014 buy or sell, and integer *q**i*. This means that the participant is ready to buy or sell *q**i* stocks at price *p**i* for one stock. A value *q**i* is also known as a volume of an order.\n\nAll orders with the same price *p* and direction *d* are merged into one aggregated order with price *p* and direction *d*.

Write a python script for the following problem: Bob is a farmer. He has a large pasture with many sheep. Recently, he has lost some of them due to wolf attacks. He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of dogs.\nDemo input: ['6 6\\n..S...\\n..S.W.\\n.S....\\n..W...\\n...W..\\n......\\n', '1 2\\nSW\\n', '5 5\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS....\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n..SD..\\n..SDW.\\n.SD...\\n.DW...\\nDD.W..\\n......\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS.D..\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n']\nNote: In the first example, we can split the pasture into two halves, one containing wolves and one containing sheep. Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\n\nVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads \u2014 major and minor.\n\nLet's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes *X*, *Y* and *Z*. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between *X* and *Y* equals 4 semitones and the distance between *Y* and *Z* is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between *X* and *Z*, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.\n\nA minor triad is different in that the distance between *X* and *Y* should be 3 semitones and between *Y* and *Z* \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nFor example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nHelp Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\nInput specification: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.. Output specification: Print \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\nDemo input: ['C E G\\n', 'C# B F\\n', 'A B H\\n'], Demo output: ['major\\n', 'minor\\n', 'strange\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Output specification: Print \"NO\" (without quotes) in the only line if it's not possible to assign the weights in a required way.\n\nOtherwise, print \"YES\" in the first line. Next *m* lines should contain the edges of the resulting graph, with weights assigned to edges which weights were erased. *i*-th of them should contain three integers *u**i*, *v**i* and *w**i*, denoting an edge between vertices *u**i* and *v**i* of weight *w**i*. The edges of the new graph must coincide with the ones in the graph from the input. The weights that were not erased must remain unchanged whereas the new weights can be any positive integer not exceeding 1018. \n\nThe order of the edges in the output doesn't matter. The length of the shortest path between *s* and *t* must be equal to *L*.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['5 5 13 0 4\\n0 1 5\\n2 1 2\\n3 2 3\\n1 4 0\\n4 3 4\\n', '2 1 123456789 0 1\\n0 1 0\\n', '2 1 999999999 1 0\\n0 1 1000000000\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n0 1 5\\n2 1 2\\n3 2 3\\n1 4 8\\n4 3 4\\n', 'YES\\n0 1 123456789\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: Here's how the graph in the first sample case looks like :\n\nIn the first sample case, there is only one missing edge weight. Placing the weight of 8 gives a shortest path from 0 to 4 of length 13.\n\nIn the second sample case, there is only a single edge. Clearly, the only way is to replace the missing weight with 123456789.\n\nIn the last sample case, there is no weights to assign but the length of the shortest path doesn't match the required value, so the answer is \"NO\"."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Mishka got an integer array $a$ of length $n$ as a birthday present (what a surprise!).\n\nMishka doesn't like this present and wants to change it somehow. He has invented an algorithm and called it \"Mishka's Adjacent Replacements Algorithm\". This algorithm can be represented as a sequence of steps:\n -  Replace each occurrence of $1$ in the array $a$ with $2$; -  Replace each occurrence of $2$ in the array $a$ with $1$; -  Replace each occurrence of $3$ in the array $a$ with $4$; -  Replace each occurrence of $4$ in the array $a$ with $3$; -  Replace each occurrence of $5$ in the array $a$ with $6$; -  Replace each occurrence of $6$ in the array $a$ with $5$; -  $\\dots$ -  Replace each occurrence of $10^9 - 1$ in the array $a$ with $10^9$; -  Replace each occurrence of $10^9$ in the array $a$ with $10^9 - 1$. \nNote that the dots in the middle of this algorithm mean that Mishka applies these replacements for each pair of adjacent integers ($2i - 1, 2i$) for each $i \\in\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 5 \\cdot 10^8\\}$ as described above.\n\nFor example, for the array $a = [1, 2, 4, 5, 10]$, the following sequence of arrays represents the algorithm: \n\n$[1, 2, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $1$ with $2$) $\\rightarrow$ $[2, 2, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $2$ with $1$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $3$ with $4$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $4$ with $3$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $5$ with $6$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 6, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $6$ with $5$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ $\\dots$ $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $10$ with $9$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 9]$.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here. Help them to determine who will win the dispute.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array. The second line contains *n* distinct space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the elements of array. \n\nThe third line contains integer *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of queries. The last line contains *m* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the search queries. Note that the queries can repeat.. Output specification: Print two integers, showing how many comparisons Vasya's approach needs and how many comparisons Petya's approach needs. Separate the numbers by spaces.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\nDemo input: ['2\\n1 2\\n1\\n1\\n', '2\\n2 1\\n1\\n1\\n', '3\\n3 1 2\\n3\\n1 2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['1 2\\n', '2 1\\n', '6 6\\n']\nNote: In the first sample Vasya's approach will make one comparison (it starts with the 1-st element and immediately finds the required number), and Petya's approach makes two comparisons (first he compares with the 2-nd array element, doesn't find the search item and compares with the 1-st element).\n\nIn the second sample, on the contrary, Vasya's approach will need two comparisons (first with 1-st element, and then with the 2-nd), and Petya's approach will find the required value in one comparison (the first comparison with the 2-nd element)."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: This problem is a little bit unusual. Here you are to implement an interaction with a testing system. That means that you can make queries and get responses in the online mode. Please be sure to use the stream flushing operation after each query's output in order not to leave part of your output in some buffer. For example, in C++ you've got to use the fflush(stdout) function, in Java \u2014 call System.out.flush(), and in Pascal \u2014 flush(output).\n\nBulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls or Bulls and Cleots) is an old code-breaking paper and pencil game for two players, predating the similar commercially marketed board game Mastermind.\n\nOn a sheet of paper, the first player thinks a secret string. This string consists only of digits and has the length 4. The digits in the string must be all different, no two or more equal digits are allowed.\n\nThen the second player tries to guess his opponent's string. For every guess the first player gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are on their right positions, they are \"bulls\", if on different positions, they are \"cows\". Thus a response is a pair of numbers \u2014 the number of \"bulls\" and the number of \"cows\". A try can contain equal digits.\n\nMore formally, let's the secret string is *s* and the second player are trying to guess it with a string *x*. The number of \"bulls\" is a number of such positions *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=4) where *s*[*i*]<==<=*x*[*i*]. The number of \"cows\" is a number of such digits *c* that *s* contains *c* in the position *i* (i.e. *s*[*i*]<==<=*c*), *x* contains *c*, but *x*[*i*]<=\u2260<=*c*.\n\nFor example, the secret string is \"0427\", the opponent's try is \"0724\", then the answer is 2 bulls and 2 cows (the bulls are \"0\" and \"2\", the cows are \"4\" and \"7\"). If the secret string is \"0123\", the opponent's try is \"0330\", then the answer is 1 bull and 1 cow.\n\nIn this problem you are to guess the string *s* that the system has chosen. You only know that the chosen string consists of 4 distinct digits.\n\nYou can make queries to the testing system, each query is the output of a single 4-digit string. The answer to the query is the number of bulls and number of cows. If the system's response equals \"4 0\", that means the interaction with your problem is over and the program must terminate.

For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\n\nVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads \u2014 major and minor.\n\nLet's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes *X*, *Y* and *Z*. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between *X* and *Y* equals 4 semitones and the distance between *Y* and *Z* is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between *X* and *Z*, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.\n\nA minor triad is different in that the distance between *X* and *Y* should be 3 semitones and between *Y* and *Z* \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nFor example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nHelp Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\nInput specification: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.. Output specification: Print \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor.

The size of the visible part of the moon (in Vitya's units) for each day is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and then cycle repeats, thus after the second 1 again goes 0.\n\nAs there is no internet in the countryside, Vitya has been watching the moon for *n* consecutive days and for each of these days he wrote down the size of the visible part of the moon. Help him find out whether the moon will be up or down next day, or this cannot be determined by the data he has.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=92)\u00a0\u2014 the number of consecutive days Vitya was watching the size of the visible part of the moon. \n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a**i* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=15)\u00a0\u2014 Vitya's records.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the input data is consistent.. Output specification: If Vitya can be sure that the size of visible part of the moon on day *n*<=+<=1 will be less than the size of the visible part on day *n*, then print \"DOWN\" at the only line of the output. If he might be sure that the size of the visible part will increase, then print \"UP\". If it's impossible to determine what exactly will happen with the moon, print -1.\nDemo input: ['5\\n3 4 5 6 7\\n', '7\\n12 13 14 15 14 13 12\\n', '1\\n8\\n'], Demo output: ['UP\\n', 'DOWN\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, the size of the moon on the next day will be equal to 8, thus the answer is \"UP\".\n\nIn the second sample, the size of the moon on the next day will be 11, thus the answer is \"DOWN\".\n\nIn the third sample, there is no way to determine whether the size of the moon on the next day will be 7 or 9, thus the answer is -1."}]}}

The task was to insert signs of operations '+' and '*', and probably brackets between the numbers so that the value of the resulting expression is as large as possible. Let's consider an example: assume that the teacher wrote numbers 1, 2 and 3 on the blackboard. Here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:\n -  1+2*3=7 -  1*(2+3)=5 -  1*2*3=6 -  (1+2)*3=9 \nNote that you can insert operation signs only between *a* and *b*, and between *b* and *c*, that is, you cannot swap integers. For instance, in the given sample you cannot get expression (1+3)*2.\n\nIt's easy to see that the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.\n\nYour task is: given *a*, *b* and *c* print the maximum value that you can get.\nInput specification: The input contains three integers *a*, *b* and *c*, each on a single line (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*,<=*c*<=\u2264<=10).. Output specification: Print the maximum value of the expression that you can obtain.\nDemo input: ['1\\n2\\n3\\n', '2\\n10\\n3\\n'], Demo output: ['9\\n', '60\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

He have studied their properties and invented a new game.\n\nInitially, Bob chooses integer *m*, bit depth of the game, which means that all numbers in the game will consist of *m* bits. Then he asks Peter to choose some *m*-bit number. After that, Bob computes the values of *n* variables. Each variable is assigned either a constant *m*-bit number or result of bitwise operation.

That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\nThus, \"localization\" will be spelt as \"l10n\", and \"internationalization\u00bb will be spelt as \"i18n\".\n\nYou are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that all too long words should be replaced by the abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any changes.\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100).

Print \"YES\" or \"NO\" accordingly, without the quotes.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contain two integers *n* and *m* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=150<=000, )\u00a0\u2014 the number of members and the number of pairs of members that are friends.\n\nThe *i*-th of the next *m* lines contains two distinct integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*a**i*<=\u2260<=*b**i*). Members *a**i* and *b**i* are friends with each other. No pair of members will appear more than once in the input.. Output specification: If the given network is reasonable, print \"YES\" in a single line (without the quotes). Otherwise, print \"NO\" in a single line (without the quotes).\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n1 3\\n3 4\\n1 4\\n', '4 4\\n3 1\\n2 3\\n3 4\\n1 2\\n', '10 4\\n4 3\\n5 10\\n8 9\\n1 2\\n', '3 2\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n', 'YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: The drawings below show the situation in the first sample (on the left) and in the second sample (on the right). Each edge represents two members that are friends. The answer is \"NO\" in the second sample because members (2,\u20093) are friends and members (3,\u20094) are friends, while members (2,\u20094) are not."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Little Nastya has a hobby, she likes to remove some letters from word, to obtain another word. But it turns out to be pretty hard for her, because she is too young. Therefore, her brother Sergey always helps her.\n\nSergey gives Nastya the word *t* and wants to get the word *p* out of it. Nastya removes letters in a certain order (one after another, in this order strictly), which is specified by permutation of letters' indices of the word *t*: *a*1... *a*|*t*|. We denote the length of word *x* as |*x*|. Note that after removing one letter, the indices of other letters don't change. For example, if *t*<==<=\"nastya\" and *a*<==<=[4,<=1,<=5,<=3,<=2,<=6] then removals make the following sequence of words \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\".\n\nSergey knows this permutation.

Harry Potter is usually asleep during history lessons, and his magical quill writes the lectures for him. Professor Binns, the history of magic teacher, lectures in such a boring and monotonous voice, that he has a soporific effect even on the quill. That's why the quill often makes mistakes, especially in dates.\n\nSo, at the end of the semester Professor Binns decided to collect the students' parchments with notes and check them. Ron Weasley is in a panic: Harry's notes may contain errors, but at least he has some notes, whereas Ron does not have any. Ronald also has been sleeping during the lectures and his quill had been eaten by his rat Scabbers. Hermione Granger refused to give Ron her notes, because, in her opinion, everyone should learn on their own. Therefore, Ron has no choice but to copy Harry's notes.\n\nDue to the quill's errors Harry's dates are absolutely confused: the years of goblin rebellions and other important events for the wizarding world do not follow in order, and sometimes even dates from the future occur. Now Ron wants to change some of the digits while he copies the notes so that the dates were in the chronological (i.e. non-decreasing) order and so that the notes did not have any dates strictly later than 2011, or strictly before than 1000. To make the resulting sequence as close as possible to the one dictated by Professor Binns, Ron will change no more than one digit in each date into other digit. Help him do it.\nInput specification: The first input line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000). It represents the number of dates in Harry's notes. Next *n* lines contain the actual dates *y*1, *y*2, ..., *y**n*, each line contains a date. Each date is a four-digit integer (1000<=\u2264<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=9999).. Output specification: Print *n* numbers *z*1, *z*2, ..., *z**n* (1000<=\u2264<=*z**i*<=\u2264<=2011). They are Ron's resulting dates. Print each number on a single line.

Each of the stages is defined by a lowercase Latin letter. This way, the rocket can be described by the string\u00a0\u2014 concatenation of letters, which correspond to the stages.\n\nThere are $n$ stages available. The rocket must contain exactly $k$ of them. Stages in the rocket should be ordered by their weight. So, after the stage with some letter can go only stage with a letter, which is at least two positions after in the alphabet (skipping one letter in between, or even more).

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: For some time the program of rounding numbers that had been developed by the Codeforces participants during one of the previous rounds, helped the citizens of Far Far Away to convert numbers into a more easily readable format. However, as time went by, the economy of the Far Far Away developed and the scale of operations grew. So the King ordered to found the Bank of Far Far Away and very soon even the rounding didn't help to quickly determine even the order of the numbers involved in operations. Besides, rounding a number to an integer wasn't very convenient as a bank needed to operate with all numbers with accuracy of up to 0.01, and not up to an integer.\n\nThe King issued yet another order: to introduce financial format to represent numbers denoting amounts of money. The formal rules of storing a number in the financial format are as follows: \n -  A number contains the integer part and the fractional part. The two parts are separated with a character \".\" (decimal point). -  To make digits in the integer part of a number easier to read, they are split into groups of three digits, starting from the least significant ones. The groups are separated with the character \",\" (comma). For example, if the integer part of a number equals 12345678, then it will be stored in the financial format as 12,345,678 -  In the financial format a number's fractional part should contain exactly two digits. So, if the initial number (the number that is converted into the financial format) contains less than two digits in the fractional part (or contains no digits at all), it is complemented with zeros until its length equals 2. If the fractional part contains more than two digits, the extra digits are simply discarded (they are not rounded: see sample tests). -  When a number is stored in the financial format, the minus sign is not written. Instead, if the initial number had the minus sign, the result is written in round brackets. -  Please keep in mind that the bank of Far Far Away operates using an exotic foreign currency \u2014 snakes ($), that's why right before the number in the financial format we should put the sign \"$\". If the number should be written in the brackets, then the snake sign should also be inside the brackets. \nFor example, by the above given rules number 2012 will be stored in the financial format as \"$2,012.00\" and number -12345678.9 will be stored as \"($12,345,678.90)\".\n\nThe merchants of Far Far Away visited you again and expressed much hope that you supply them with the program that can convert arbitrary numbers to the financial format. Can you help them?\nInput specification: The input contains a number that needs to be converted into financial format. The number's notation length does not exceed 100 characters, including (possible) signs \"-\" (minus) and \".\" (decimal point). The number's notation is correct, that is: \n -  The number's notation only contains characters from the set {\"0\" \u2013 \"9\", \"-\", \".\"}. -  The decimal point (if it is present) is unique and is preceded and followed by a non-zero quantity on decimal digits -  A number cannot start with digit 0, except for a case when its whole integer part equals zero (in this case the integer parts is guaranteed to be a single zero: \"0\"). -  The minus sign (if it is present) is unique and stands in the very beginning of the number's notation -  If a number is identically equal to 0 (that is, if it is written as, for example, \"0\" or \"0.000\"), than it is not preceded by the minus sign. -  The input data contains no spaces. -  The number's notation contains at least one decimal digit.. Output specification: Print the number given in the input in the financial format by the rules described in the problem statement.\nDemo input: ['2012\\n', '0.000\\n', '-0.00987654321\\n', '-12345678.9\\n'], Demo output: ['$2,012.00', '$0.00', '($0.00)', '($12,345,678.90)']\nNote: Pay attention to the second and third sample tests. They show that the sign of a number in the financial format (and consequently, the presence or absence of brackets) is determined solely by the sign of the initial number. It does not depend on the sign of the number you got after translating the number to the financial format."}]}}

After team excursion to Sun Island Park for snow sculpture art exposition, PMP should get back to buses before they leave. But the park is really big and he does not know how to find them.\n\nThe park has *n* intersections numbered 1 through *n*. There are *m* bidirectional roads that connect some pairs of these intersections. At *k* intersections, ICPC volunteers are helping the teams and showing them the way to their destinations. Locations of volunteers are fixed and distinct.\n\nWhen PMP asks a volunteer the way to bus station, he/she can tell him the whole path. But the park is fully covered with ice and snow and everywhere looks almost the same. So PMP can only memorize at most *q* intersections after each question (excluding the intersection they are currently standing). He always tells volunteers about his weak memory and if there is no direct path of length (in number of roads) at most *q* that leads to bus station, the volunteer will guide PMP to another volunteer (who is at most *q* intersections away, of course). ICPC volunteers know the area very well and always tell PMP the best way. So if there exists a way to bus stations, PMP will definitely find it.\n\nPMP's initial location is intersection *s* and the buses are at intersection *t*. There will always be a volunteer at intersection *s*. Your job is to find out the minimum *q* which guarantees that PMP can find the buses.\nInput specification: The first line contains three space-separated integers *n*,<=*m*,<=*k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105,<=0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105,<=1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of intersections, roads and volunteers, respectively.

It might not always be possible to reach *t* from *s*.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is always a volunteer at intersection *s*.. Output specification: Print on the only line the answer to the problem \u2014 the minimum value of *q* which guarantees that PMP can find the buses. If PMP cannot reach the buses at all, output -1 instead.\nDemo input: ['6 6 3\\n1 3 6\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n4 5\\n3 4\\n1 6\\n', '6 5 3\\n1 5 6\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 4\\n4 5\\n6 3\\n1 5\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n', '3\\n']\nNote: The first sample is illustrated below. Blue intersections are where volunteers are located.

Write a python script for the following problem: Alice has a very important message *M* consisting of some non-negative integers that she wants to keep secret from Eve. Alice knows that the only theoretically secure cipher is one-time pad. Alice generates a random key *K* of the length equal to the message's length. Alice computes the bitwise xor of each element of the message and the key (, where  denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR)) and stores this encrypted message *A*. Alice is smart. Be like Alice.\n\nFor example, Alice may have wanted to store a message *M*<==<=(0,<=15,<=9,<=18). She generated a key *K*<==<=(16,<=7,<=6,<=3). The encrypted message is thus *A*<==<=(16,<=8,<=15,<=17).\n\nAlice realised that she cannot store the key with the encrypted message. Alice sent her key *K* to Bob and deleted her own copy. Alice is smart. Really, be like Alice.\n\nBob realised that the encrypted message is only secure as long as the key is secret. Bob thus randomly permuted the key before storing it. Bob thinks that this way, even if Eve gets both the encrypted message and the key, she will not be able to read the message. Bob is not smart. Don't be like Bob.\n\nIn the above example, Bob may have, for instance, selected a permutation (3,<=4,<=1,<=2) and stored the permuted key *P*<==<=(6,<=3,<=16,<=7).\n\nOne year has passed and Alice wants to decrypt her message. Only now Bob has realised that this is impossible. As he has permuted the key randomly, the message is lost forever. Did we mention that Bob isn't smart?\n\nBob wants to salvage at least some information from the message. Since he is not so smart, he asks for your help. You know the encrypted message *A* and the permuted key *P*.

After this new revolutionary discovery, he invented a game for kids which uses xor-trees.\n\nThe game is played on a tree having *n* nodes, numbered from 1 to *n*. Each node *i* has an initial value *init**i*, which is either 0 or 1. The root of the tree is node 1.\n\nOne can perform several (possibly, zero) operations on the tree during the game. The only available type of operation is to pick a node *x*. Right after someone has picked node *x*, the value of node *x* flips, the values of sons of *x* remain the same, the values of sons of sons of *x* flips, the values of sons of sons of sons of *x* remain the same and so on.\n\nThe goal of the game is to get each node *i* to have value *goal**i*, which can also be only 0 or 1. You need to reach the goal of the game by using minimum number of operations.\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105).

Since the sought number can be large enough, you need to calculate the answer modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *l* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100,<=1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=3000) \u2014 the number of different board types and the fence length, correspondingly. Next *n* lines contain descriptions of board types: the *i*-th line contains two integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the sizes of the board of the *i*-th type. All numbers on the lines are separated by spaces.. Output specification: Print a single integer \u2014 the sought number of variants modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\nDemo input: ['2 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n', '1 2\\n2 2\\n', '6 6\\n2 1\\n3 2\\n2 5\\n3 3\\n5 1\\n2 1\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '1\\n', '20\\n']\nNote: In the first sample there are exactly two variants of arranging a beautiful fence of length 3: \n -  As the first fence board use the board of the first type of length 1 and width 2. As the second board use board of the second type of length 2 and width 3. -  Use one board of the second type after you turn it. That makes its length equal 3, and width \u2014 2."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Merge sort is a well-known sorting algorithm. The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:\n 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=\u2264<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* \u2014 *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\nInput specification: The first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it..

As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too.

In other words, if the remaining measurements have the smallest result *x*, and the largest result *y*, then the inequality *y*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7*x* must fulfill.

That leaves him with the only coin he initially has. -  The second knight can kill the first knight and add his coin to his own two. -  The third knight is the strongest, but he can't kill more than $k = 2$ other knights. It is optimal to kill the second and the fourth knights: $2+11+33 = 46$. -  The fourth knight should kill the first and the second knights: $33+1+2 = 36$. \nIn the second example the first knight can't kill anyone, while all the others should kill the one with the index less by one than their own.\n\nIn the third example there is only one knight, so he can't kill anyone."}]}}

A network topology is the way of describing the network configuration, the scheme that shows the location and the connections of network devices.\n\nPolycarpus knows three main network topologies: bus, ring and star. A bus is the topology that represents a shared cable with all computers connected with it. In the ring topology the cable connects each computer only with two other ones. A star is the topology where all computers of a network are connected to the single central node.\n\nLet's represent each of these network topologies as a connected non-directed graph. A bus is a connected graph that is the only path, that is, the graph where all nodes are connected with two other ones except for some two nodes that are the beginning and the end of the path. A ring is a connected graph, where all nodes are connected with two other ones. A star is a connected graph, where a single central node is singled out and connected with all other nodes. For clarifications, see the picture.\n\nYou've got a connected non-directed graph that characterizes the computer network in Polycarpus' corporation.

Take a look at the picture for further clarifications.\nInput specification: First line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m*(2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=200<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of points and the number segments on the picture respectively. \n\nThen follow *m* lines, each containing two integers *u**i* and *v**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, *u**i*<=\u2260<=*v**i*)\u00a0\u2014 the numbers of points connected by corresponding segment. It's guaranteed that no two segments connect the same pair of points.. Output specification: Print the maximum possible value of the hedgehog's beauty.\nDemo input: ['8 6\\n4 5\\n3 5\\n2 5\\n1 2\\n2 8\\n6 7\\n', '4 6\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n1 4\\n2 3\\n2 4\\n3 4\\n'], Demo output: ['9\\n', '12\\n']\nNote: The picture below corresponds to the first sample. Segments that form the hedgehog are painted red. The tail consists of a sequence of points with numbers 1, 2 and 5. The following segments are spines: (2, 5), (3, 5) and (4, 5). Therefore, the beauty of the hedgehog is equal to 3\u00b73\u2009=\u20099.\n\n<img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/b3601595b30564928c0ce72c4d371941925f12e3.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective. You are able to cope with it not worse, aren't you?\nInput specification: The first and single line contains two integers *A* and *B* (1<=\u2264<=*A*,<=*B*<=\u2264<=109,<=*min*(*A*,<=*B*)<=\u2264<=12)..

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible.

In addition, sectors 1 and *n* are also adjacent.\n\nSome sectors have bridge threads. Each bridge connects the two main threads that make up this sector. The points at which the bridge is attached to the main threads will be called attachment points. Both attachment points of a bridge are at the same distance from the center of the web. At each attachment point exactly one bridge is attached. The bridges are adjacent if they are in the same sector, and there are no other bridges between them.\n\nA cell of the web is a trapezoid, which is located in one of the sectors and is bounded by two main threads and two adjacent bridges. You can see that the sides of the cell may have the attachment points of bridges from adjacent sectors. If the number of attachment points on one side of the cell is not equal to the number of attachment points on the other side, it creates an imbalance of pulling forces on this cell and this may eventually destroy the entire web.

Write a python script for the following problem: In one little known, but very beautiful country called Waterland, lives a lovely shark Valerie. Like all the sharks, she has several rows of teeth, and feeds on crucians. One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are \"relaxing\".\n\nFor a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap).\n\nIt turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again. \n\nUnhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her. For sure, the shark couldn't say no to her favourite meal, but she had no desire to go back to the dentist. That's why she decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that the viability of no tooth becomes negative. \n\nAs Valerie is not good at mathematics, she asked you to help her to find out the total amount of crucians that she can consume for dinner.\n\nWe should remind you that while eating one crucian Valerie uses exactly one row of teeth and the viability of each tooth from this row decreases by one.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000,<=0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 total amount of Valerie's teeth, amount of tooth rows and amount of crucians in Valerie's portion for dinner.

They are developing an algorithm for two bots playing a two-player game. The game is cooperative and turn based. In each turn, one of the players makes a move (it doesn\u2019t matter which player, it's possible that players turns do not alternate). \n\nAlgorithm for bots that Sasha and Ira are developing works by keeping track of the state the game is in. Each time either bot makes a move, the state changes. And, since the game is very dynamic, it will never go back to the state it was already in at any point in the past.\n\nSasha and Ira are perfectionists and want their algorithm to have an optimal winning strategy. They have noticed that in the optimal winning strategy, both bots make exactly *N* moves each. But, in order to find the optimal strategy, their algorithm needs to analyze all possible states of the game (they haven\u2019t learned about alpha-beta pruning yet) and pick the best sequence of moves.\n\nThey are worried about the efficiency of their algorithm and are wondering what is the total number of states of the game that need to be analyzed?\nInput specification: The first and only line contains integer N.\n -  1<=\u2264<=*N*<=\u2264<=106.

It can make moves when in state E, F and G, so states I, K and M are added to the list. Similarly, blue bot cannot make a move when in state G, but can when in D, E and F, so states H, J and L are added. -  Turn 4: Red bot already did N=2 moves when in states H, I and K, so it can only make moves when in J, L and M, so states P, R and S are added.

Array [2,<=1,<=2,<=1,<=2,<=1] is at the same time 2-periodic and 6-periodic and array [1,<=2,<=1,<=1,<=2,<=1,<=1,<=2,<=1] is at the same time 3-periodic and 9-periodic.\n\nFor the given array *a*, consisting only of numbers one and two, find the minimum number of elements to change to make the array *k*-periodic. If the array already is *k*-periodic, then the required value equals 0.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains a pair of integers *n*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), where *n* is the length of the array and the value *n* is divisible by *k*. The second line contains the sequence of elements of the given array *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=2), *a**i* is the *i*-th element of the array.. Output specification: Print the minimum number of array elements we need to change to make the array *k*-periodic. If the array already is *k*-periodic, then print 0.\nDemo input: ['6 2\\n2 1 2 2 2 1\\n', '8 4\\n1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1\\n', '9 3\\n2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '0\\n', '3\\n']\nNote: In the first sample it is enough to change the fourth element from 2 to 1, then the array changes to [2,\u20091,\u20092,\u20091,\u20092,\u20091].\n\nIn the second sample, the given array already is 4-periodic.\n\nIn the third sample it is enough to replace each occurrence of number two by number one. In this case the array will look as [1,\u20091,\u20091,\u20091,\u20091,\u20091,\u20091,\u20091,\u20091] \u2014 this array is simultaneously 1-, 3- and 9-periodic."}]}}

In the output section below you will see the information about flushing the output.\n\nBear Limak thinks of some hidden number\u00a0\u2014 an integer from interval [2,<=100]. Your task is to say if the hidden number is prime or composite.\n\nInteger *x*<=&gt;<=1 is called prime if it has exactly two distinct divisors, 1 and *x*. If integer *x*<=&gt;<=1 is not prime, it's called composite.\n\nYou can ask up to 20 queries about divisors of the hidden number. In each query you should print an integer from interval [2,<=100]. The system will answer \"yes\" if your integer is a divisor of the hidden number. Otherwise, the answer will be \"no\".\n\nFor example, if the hidden number is 14 then the system will answer \"yes\" only if you print 2, 7 or 14.\n\nWhen you are done asking queries, print \"prime\" or \"composite\" and terminate your program.\n\nYou will get the Wrong Answer verdict if you ask more than 20 queries, or if you print an integer not from the range [2,<=100]. Also, you will get the Wrong Answer verdict if the printed answer isn't correct.\n\nYou will get the Idleness Limit Exceeded verdict if you don't print anything (but you should) or if you forget about flushing the output (more info below).\nInput specification: After each query you should read one string from the input. It will be \"yes\" if the printed integer is a divisor of the hidden number, and \"no\" otherwise.. Output specification: Up to 20 times you can ask a query\u00a0\u2014 print an integer from interval [2,<=100] in one line. You have to both print the end-of-line character and flush the output. After flushing you should read a response from the input.\n\nIn any moment you can print the answer \"prime\" or \"composite\" (without the quotes). After that, flush the output and terminate your program.\n\nTo flush you can use (just after printing an integer and end-of-line): \n -  fflush(stdout) in C++; -  System.out.flush() in Java; -  stdout.flush() in Python; -  flush(output) in Pascal; -  See the documentation for other languages. \nHacking. To hack someone, as the input you should print the hidden number\u00a0\u2014 one integer from the interval [2,<=100].

Thus, it must be composite. Note that it isn't necessary to know the exact value of the hidden number. In this test, the hidden number is 30.\n\n<img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/35c6952617fa94ec3e0ea8e63aa1c3c49b3ba420.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\n59 is a divisor of the hidden number. In the interval [2,\u2009100] there is only one number with this divisor. The hidden number must be 59, which is prime. Note that the answer is known even after the second query and you could print it then and terminate. Though, it isn't forbidden to ask unnecessary queries (unless you exceed the limit of 20 queries)."}]}}

She may buy as many sheets of stickers as she wants, and may specify any string of length *n* for the sheets, but all the sheets must be identical, so the string is the same for all sheets. Once she attains the sheets of stickers, she will take some of the stickers from the sheets and arrange (in any order) them to form *s*. Determine the minimum number of sheets she has to buy, and provide a string describing a possible sheet of stickers she should buy.\nInput specification: The first line contains string *s* (1<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=1000), consisting of lowercase English characters only. The second line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000).. Output specification: On the first line, print the minimum number of sheets Piegirl has to buy. On the second line, print a string consisting of *n* lower case English characters. This string should describe a sheet of stickers that Piegirl can buy in order to minimize the number of sheets. If Piegirl cannot possibly form the string *s*, print instead a single line with the number -1.\nDemo input: ['banana\\n4\\n', 'banana\\n3\\n', 'banana\\n2\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\nbaan\\n', '3\\nnab\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: In the second example, Piegirl can order 3 sheets of stickers with the characters \"nab\". She can take characters \"nab\" from the first sheet, \"na\" from the second, and \"a\" from the third, and arrange them to from \"banana\"."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Shapur was an extremely gifted student. He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.\n\nOne day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.\nInput specification: There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number. It is guaranteed that the numbers are made from 0 and 1 only and that their length is same. The numbers may start with 0. The length of each number doesn't exceed 100.. Output specification: Write one line \u2014 the corresponding answer. Do not omit the leading 0s.\nDemo input: ['1010100\\n0100101\\n', '000\\n111\\n', '1110\\n1010\\n', '01110\\n01100\\n'], Demo output: ['1110001\\n', '111\\n', '0100\\n', '00010\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}
