Write a python script for the following problem: When Valera was playing football on a stadium, it suddenly began to rain. Valera hid in the corridor under the grandstand not to get wet. However, the desire to play was so great that he decided to train his hitting the ball right in this corridor. Valera went back far enough, put the ball and hit it. The ball bounced off the walls, the ceiling and the floor corridor and finally hit the exit door. As the ball was wet, it left a spot on the door. Now Valera wants to know the coordinates for this spot.\n\nLet's describe the event more formally. The ball will be considered a point in space. The door of the corridor will be considered a rectangle located on plane *xOz*, such that the lower left corner of the door is located at point (0,<=0,<=0), and the upper right corner is located at point (*a*,<=0,<=*b*) . The corridor will be considered as a rectangular parallelepiped, infinite in the direction of increasing coordinates of *y*. In this corridor the floor will be considered as plane *xOy*, and the ceiling as plane, parallel to *xOy* and passing through point (*a*,<=0,<=*b*). We will also assume that one of the walls is plane *yOz*, and the other wall is plane, parallel to *yOz* and passing through point (*a*,<=0,<=*b*).\n\nWe'll say that the ball hit the door when its coordinate *y* was equal to 0. Thus the coordinates of the spot are point (*x*0,<=0,<=*z*0), where 0<=\u2264<=*x*0<=\u2264<=*a*,<=0<=\u2264<=*z*0<=\u2264<=*b*. To hit the ball, Valera steps away from the door at distance *m* and puts the ball in the center of the corridor at point . After the hit the ball flies at speed (*v**x*,<=*v**y*,<=*v**z*). This means that if the ball has coordinates (*x*,<=*y*,<=*z*), then after one second it will have coordinates (*x*<=+<=*v**x*,<=*y*<=+<=*v**y*,<=*z*<=+<=*v**z*).\n\nSee image in notes for clarification.\n\nWhen the ball collides with the ceiling, the floor or a wall of the corridor, it bounces off in accordance with the laws of reflection (the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection). In the problem we consider the ideal physical model, so we can assume that there is no air resistance, friction force, or any loss of energy.\nInput specification: The first line contains three space-separated integers *a*,<=*b*,<=*m* (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100). The first two integers specify point (*a*,<=0,<=*b*), through which the ceiling and one of the corridor walls pass. The third integer is the distance at which Valera went away from the door.\n\nThe second line has three space-separated integers *v**x*,<=*v**y*,<=*v**z* (|*v**x*|,<=|*v**y*|,<=|*v**z*|<=\u2264<=100,<=*v**y*<=&lt;<=0,<=*v**z*<=\u2265<=0) \u2014 the speed of the ball after the hit.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the ball hits the door..

We have that $|v_i| \\le 10^6$ for all $i$.. Output specification: Output a single line containing $n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \\cdots, c_n$, each of which is either $1$ or $-1$. Your solution is correct if the value of $p = \\sum_{i = 1}^n c_i \\vec{v_i}$, satisfies $|p| \\le 1.5 \\cdot 10^6$.\n\nIt can be shown that a solution always exists under the given constraints.\nDemo input: ['3\\n999999 0\\n0 999999\\n999999 0\\n', '1\\n-824590 246031\\n', '8\\n-67761 603277\\n640586 -396671\\n46147 -122580\\n569609 -2112\\n400 914208\\n131792 309779\\n-850150 -486293\\n5272 721899\\n'], Demo output: ['1 1 -1 \\n', '1 \\n', '1 1 1 1 1 1 1 -1 \\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Imagine that you have a twin brother or sister. Having another person that looks exactly like you seems very unusual. It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.\n\nNow let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins. The second line contains a sequence of *n* integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the coins' values. All numbers are separated with spaces.. Output specification: In the single line print the single number \u2014 the minimum needed number of coins.\nDemo input: ['2\\n3 3\\n', '3\\n2 1 2\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: In the first sample you will have to take 2 coins (you and your twin have sums equal to 6,\u20090 correspondingly). If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too. You can pick coins with values 1,\u20092 or 2,\u20092. In any case, the minimum number of coins equals 2."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$.. Output specification: Print the only integer \u2014 maximum possible total time when the lamp is lit.\nDemo input: ['3 10\\n4 6 7\\n', '2 12\\n1 10\\n', '2 7\\n3 4\\n'], Demo output: ['8\\n', '9\\n', '6\\n']\nNote: In the first example, one of possible optimal solutions is to insert value $x = 3$ before $a_1$, so program will be $[3, 4, 6, 7]$ and time of lamp being lit equals $(3 - 0) + (6 - 4) + (10 - 7) = 8$. Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$."}]}}

Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket.

Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons.-  During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining.-  While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel.

Write a python script for the following problem: Merge sort is a well-known sorting algorithm. The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:\n 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=\u2264<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* \u2014 *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\nInput specification: The first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it..

Write a python script for the following problem: By 2312 there were *n* Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*)..

Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.\n\nOstap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly *k* cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if *k*<==<=1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if *k*<==<=2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.\n\nYour goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.\n\nThe second line contains a string of length *n* consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.. Output specification: If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length *k*), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print \"YES\" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\nDemo input: ['5 2\\n#G#T#\\n', '6 1\\nT....G\\n', '7 3\\nT..#..G\\n', '6 2\\n..GT..\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'YES\\n', 'NO\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.\n\nIn the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free\u00a0\u2014 he can get there by jumping left 5 times.\n\nIn the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.\n\nIn the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect."}]}}

Vasya got a New Year present \u2014 the clock that shows not only the time, but also the date.\n\nThe clock's face can display any number from 1 to *d*. It is guaranteed that *a**i*<=\u2264<=*d* for all *i* from 1 to *n*. The clock does not keep information about the current month, so when a new day comes, it simply increases the current day number by one. The clock cannot display number *d*<=+<=1, so after day number *d* it shows day 1 (the current day counter resets). The mechanism of the clock allows you to increase the day number by one manually. When you execute this operation, day *d* is also followed by day 1.\n\nVasya begins each day checking the day number on the clock. If the day number on the clock does not match the actual day number in the current month, then Vasya manually increases it by one. Vasya is persistent and repeats this operation until the day number on the clock matches the actual number of the current day in the current month.\n\nA year passed and Vasya wonders how many times he manually increased the day number by one, from the first day of the first month to the last day of the *n*-th month inclusive, considering that on the first day of the first month the clock display showed day 1.\nInput specification: The first line contains the single number *d* \u2014 the maximum number of the day that Vasya's clock can show (1<=\u2264<=*d*<=\u2264<=106).\n\nThe second line contains a single integer *n* \u2014 the number of months in the year (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2000).\n\nThe third line contains *n* space-separated integers: *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*d*) \u2014 the number of days in each month in the order in which they follow, starting from the first one..

Anna and Maria are in the opposite squares of a chessboard (8<=\u00d7<=8): Anna is in the upper right corner, and Maria is in the lower left one. Apart from them, the board has several statues. Each statue occupies exactly one square. A square that contains a statue cannot have anything or anyone \u2014 neither any other statues, nor Anna, nor Maria.\n\nAnna is present on the board as a figurant (she stands still and never moves), and Maria has been actively involved in the game. Her goal is \u2014 to come to Anna's square. Maria and statues move in turn, Maria moves first. During one move Maria can go to any adjacent on the side or diagonal cell in which there is no statue, or she can stay in the cell where she is. The statues during their move must go one square down simultaneously, and those statues that were in the bottom row fall from the board and are no longer appeared.\n\nAt that moment, when one of the statues is in the cell in which the Maria is, the statues are declared winners. At the moment when Maria comes into the cell where Anna has been waiting, Maria is declared the winner.\n\nObviously, nothing depends on the statues, so it all depends on Maria. Determine who will win, if Maria does not make a strategic error.\nInput specification: You are given the 8 strings whose length equals 8, describing the initial position on the board. The first line represents the top row of the board, the next one \u2014 for the second from the top, and so on, the last line represents the bottom row. Each character string matches a single cell board in the appropriate row, and the characters are in the same manner as that of the corresponding cell.

An employee *A* is said to be the superior of another employee *B* if at least one of the following is true:\n -  Employee *A* is the immediate manager of employee *B* -  Employee *B* has an immediate manager employee *C* such that employee *A* is the superior of employee *C*. \nThe company will not have a managerial cycle. That is, there will not exist an employee who is the superior of his/her own immediate manager.\n\nToday the company is going to arrange a party. This involves dividing all *n* employees into several groups: every employee must belong to exactly one group. Furthermore, within any single group, there must not be two employees *A* and *B* such that *A* is the superior of *B*.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of groups that must be formed?\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2000) \u2014 the number of employees.\n\nThe next *n* lines contain the integers *p**i* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=*n* or *p**i*<==<=-1). Every *p**i* denotes the immediate manager for the *i*-th employee. If *p**i* is -1, that means that the *i*-th employee does not have an immediate manager. \n\nIt is guaranteed, that no employee will be the immediate manager of him/herself (*p**i*<=\u2260<=*i*). Also, there will be no managerial cycles.. Output specification: Print a single integer denoting the minimum number of groups that will be formed in the party.\nDemo input: ['5\\n-1\\n1\\n2\\n1\\n-1\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n']\nNote: For the first example, three groups are sufficient, for example: \n -  Employee 1 -  Employees 2 and 4 -  Employees 3 and 5"}]}}

For example, if we flip 123 the result is the integer 321, but flipping 130 we obtain 31, and by flipping 31 we come to 13.\n\nOksana Fillipovna picked some number *a* without leading zeroes, and flipped it to get number *a**r*.

And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example.

Your task is to find any sequence of cards that Alice and Bob could have played with.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers, *x*,<=*y* (1<=\u2264<=*x*,<=*y*<=\u2264<=1018,<=*xy*<=&gt;<=1) \u2014 the number of oranges and apples that were initially in the bag.. Output specification: Print any sequence of cards that would meet the problem conditions as a compressed string of characters 'A' and 'B. That means that you need to replace the segments of identical consecutive characters by the number of repetitions of the characters and the actual character. For example, string AAABAABBB should be replaced by string 3A1B2A3B, but cannot be replaced by 2A1A1B2A3B or by 3AB2A3B. See the samples for clarifications of the output format. The string that you print should consist of at most 106 characters. It is guaranteed that if the answer exists, its compressed representation exists, consisting of at most 106 characters. If there are several possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them.\n\nIf the sequence of cards that meet the problem statement does not not exist, print a single word Impossible.\nDemo input: ['1 4\\n', '2 2\\n', '3 2\\n'], Demo output: ['3B\\n', 'Impossible\\n', '1A1B\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, if the row contained three cards with letter 'B', then Bob should give one apple to Alice three times. So, in the end of the game Alice has one orange and three apples, and Bob has one apple, in total it is one orange and four apples.\n\nIn second sample, there is no answer since one card is not enough for game to finish, and two cards will produce at least three apples or three oranges.\n\nIn the third sample, cards contain letters 'AB', so after removing the first card Bob has one orange and one apple, and after removal of second card Alice has two oranges and one apple. So, in total it is three oranges and two apples."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.\n\nThere are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.\n\nOfficer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:\n -  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$; -  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. \nFor example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\n\nThe structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.\n\nFormally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.\n\nBerland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.\n\nSuppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ \u2014 one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.\n\nLet's look at the following example:\n\nIf officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.\n\nIf officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.\n\nTo answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.\n\nYou should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i &lt; i$), where $p_i$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $i$. The commander has index $1$ and doesn't have any superiors.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query is given as a pair ($u_i, k_i$) ($1 \\le u_i, k_i \\le n$), where $u_i$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $k_i$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence.. Output specification: Print $q$ numbers, where the $i$-th number is the officer at the position $k_i$ in the list which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if it starts spreading from officer $u_i$. Print \"-1\" if the number of officers which receive the command is less than $k_i$.\n\nYou should process queries independently. They do not affect each other.\nDemo input: ['9 6\\n1 1 1 3 5 3 5 7\\n3 1\\n1 5\\n3 4\\n7 3\\n1 8\\n1 9\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n6\\n8\\n-1\\n9\\n4\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

This algorithm can be represented as a sequence of steps:\n -  Replace each occurrence of $1$ in the array $a$ with $2$; -  Replace each occurrence of $2$ in the array $a$ with $1$; -  Replace each occurrence of $3$ in the array $a$ with $4$; -  Replace each occurrence of $4$ in the array $a$ with $3$; -  Replace each occurrence of $5$ in the array $a$ with $6$; -  Replace each occurrence of $6$ in the array $a$ with $5$; -  $\\dots$ -  Replace each occurrence of $10^9 - 1$ in the array $a$ with $10^9$; -  Replace each occurrence of $10^9$ in the array $a$ with $10^9 - 1$. \nNote that the dots in the middle of this algorithm mean that Mishka applies these replacements for each pair of adjacent integers ($2i - 1, 2i$) for each $i \\in\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 5 \\cdot 10^8\\}$ as described above.\n\nFor example, for the array $a = [1, 2, 4, 5, 10]$, the following sequence of arrays represents the algorithm: \n\n$[1, 2, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $1$ with $2$) $\\rightarrow$ $[2, 2, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $2$ with $1$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $3$ with $4$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 4, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $4$ with $3$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $5$ with $6$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 6, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $6$ with $5$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ $\\dots$ $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 10]$ $\\rightarrow$ (replace all occurrences of $10$ with $9$) $\\rightarrow$ $[1, 1, 3, 5, 9]$.

Write a python script for the following problem: Little Petya has recently started attending a programming club. Naturally he is facing the problem of choosing a programming language. After long considerations he realized that Java is the best choice. The main argument in favor of choosing Java was that it has a very large integer data type, called BigInteger.\n\nBut having attended several classes of the club, Petya realized that not all tasks require using the BigInteger type. It turned out that in some tasks it is much easier to use small data types. That's why a question arises: \"Which integer type to use if one wants to store a positive integer *n*?\"\n\nPetya knows only 5 integer types:\n\n1) byte occupies 1 byte and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=128 to 127\n\n2) short occupies 2 bytes and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=32768 to 32767\n\n3) int occupies 4 bytes and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=2147483648 to 2147483647\n\n4) long occupies 8 bytes and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807\n\n5) BigInteger can store any integer number, but at that it is not a primitive type, and operations with it are much slower.\n\nFor all the types given above the boundary values are included in the value range.\n\nFrom this list, Petya wants to choose the smallest type that can store a positive integer *n*. Since BigInteger works much slower, Peter regards it last. Help him.\nInput specification: The first line contains a positive number *n*.

Write a python script for the following problem: The boss of the Company of Robot is a cruel man. His motto is \"Move forward Or Die!\". And that is exactly what his company's product do. Look at the behavior of the company's robot when it is walking in the directed graph. This behavior has been called \"Three Laws of Robotics\":\n -  Law 1. The Robot will destroy itself when it visits a vertex of the graph which it has already visited. -  Law 2. The Robot will destroy itself when it has no way to go (that is when it reaches a vertex whose out-degree is zero). -  Law 3. The Robot will move randomly when it has multiple ways to move (that is when it reach a vertex whose out-degree is more than one). Of course, the robot can move only along the directed edges of the graph. \nCan you imagine a robot behaving like that? That's why they are sold at a very low price, just for those who are short of money, including mzry1992, of course. mzry1992 has such a robot, and she wants to move it from vertex *s* to vertex *t* in a directed graph safely without self-destruction. Luckily, she can send her robot special orders at each vertex. A special order shows the robot which way to move, if it has multiple ways to move (to prevent random moving of the robot according to Law 3). When the robot reaches vertex *t*, mzry1992 takes it off the graph immediately. So you can see that, as long as there exists a path from *s* to *t*, she can always find a way to reach the goal (whatever the vertex *t* has the outdegree of zero or not). \n\nHowever, sending orders is expensive, so your task is to find the minimum number of orders mzry1992 needs to send in the worst case. Please note that mzry1992 can give orders to the robot while it is walking on the graph. Look at the first sample to clarify that part of the problem.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 the number of vertices of the graph, and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 the number of edges. Then *m* lines follow, each with two integers *u**i* and *v**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=*n*; *v**i*<=\u2260<=*u**i*), these integers denote that there is a directed edge from vertex *u**i* to vertex *v**i*. The last line contains two integers *s* and *t* (1<=\u2264<=*s*,<=*t*<=\u2264<=*n*).\n\nIt is guaranteed that there are no multiple edges and self-loops.. Output specification: If there is a way to reach a goal, print the required minimum number of orders in the worst case. Otherwise, print -1.\nDemo input: ['4 6\\n1 2\\n2 1\\n1 3\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n3 4\\n1 4\\n', '4 5\\n1 2\\n2 1\\n1 3\\n2 4\\n3 4\\n1 4\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '1\\n']\nNote: Consider the first test sample. Initially the robot is on vertex 1. So, on the first step the robot can go to vertex 2 or 3. No matter what vertex the robot chooses, mzry1992 must give an order to the robot. This order is to go to vertex 4. If mzry1992 doesn't give an order to the robot at vertex 2 or 3, the robot can choose the \"bad\" outgoing edge (return to vertex 1) according Law 3. So, the answer is one."}]}}

They all need to move to the 1-st segment. One member of the crew, the alien with the identification number CFR-140, decided to calculate the minimum time (in minutes) they will need to perform this task.\n\nHelp CFR-140, figure out the minimum time (in minutes) that all the astronauts will need to move from the 3-rd segment to the 1-st one. Since this number can be rather large, count it modulo *m*.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers: *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the number of aliens on the saucer and the number, modulo which you should print the answer, correspondingly.. Output specification: Print a single number \u2014 the answer to the problem modulo *m*.\nDemo input: ['1 10\\n', '3 8\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: In the first sample the only crew member moves from segment 3 to segment 2, and then from segment 2 to segment 1 without any problems. Thus, the whole moving will take two minutes.\n\nTo briefly describe the movements in the second sample we will use value <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/4c7c8e716067e9c6251e8ca82a4ca7fde74fbacb.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, which would correspond to an alien with rank *i* moving from the segment in which it is at the moment, to the segment number *j*.

They've made a deal with Seryozha and now they need to make a deal with the dorm guards...\n\nThere are four guardposts in Dima's dorm. Each post contains two guards (in Russia they are usually elderly women). You can bribe a guard by a chocolate bar or a box of juice. For each guard you know the minimum price of the chocolate bar she can accept as a gift and the minimum price of the box of juice she can accept as a gift. If a chocolate bar for some guard costs less than the minimum chocolate bar price for this guard is, or if a box of juice for some guard costs less than the minimum box of juice price for this guard is, then the guard doesn't accept such a gift.\n\nIn order to pass through a guardpost, one needs to bribe both guards.\n\nThe shop has an unlimited amount of juice and chocolate of any price starting with 1. Dima wants to choose some guardpost, buy one gift for each guard from the guardpost and spend exactly *n* rubles on it.\n\nHelp him choose a post through which he can safely sneak Inna or otherwise say that this is impossible.

Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24.

Initially, Farmer John has *n* different species of flowers he can plant, with *a**i* flowers of the *i*-th species.\n\nOn each of the next *q* days, Farmer John will receive a batch of flowers of a new species. On day *j*, he will receive *c**j* flowers of the same species, but of a different species from those Farmer John already has. \n\nFarmer John, knowing the right balance between extravagance and minimalism, wants exactly *k* species of flowers to be used. Furthermore, to reduce waste, each flower of the *k* species Farmer John chooses must be planted in some garden. And each of the gardens must be identical; that is to say that each of the *k* chosen species should have an equal number of flowers in each garden. As Farmer John is a proponent of national equality, he would like to create the greatest number of gardens possible.\n\nAfter receiving flowers on each of these *q* days, Farmer John would like to know the sum, over all possible choices of *k* species, of the maximum number of gardens he could create. Since this could be a large number, you should output your result modulo 109<=+<=7.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains three integers *n*, *k* and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000, 1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=100<=000).\n\nThe *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) of the next *n* lines of the input contains an integer *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=1<=000<=000), the number of flowers of species *i* Farmer John has initially.\n\nThe *j*-th (1<=\u2264<=*j*<=\u2264<=*q*) of the next *q* lines of the input contains an integer *c**j* (1<=\u2264<=*c**j*<=\u2264<=1<=000<=000), the number of flowers of a new species Farmer John receives on day *j*..

Packmen do not interfere with the movement of other packmen; in one cell there can be any number of packmen moving in any directions.\n\nYour task is to determine minimum possible time after which Packmen can eat all the asterisks.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the length of the game field.\n\nThe second line contains the description of the game field consisting of *n* symbols. If there is symbol '.' in position *i* \u2014 the cell *i* is empty. If there is symbol '*' in position *i* \u2014 in the cell *i* contains an asterisk. If there is symbol 'P' in position *i* \u2014 Packman is in the cell *i*.\n\nIt is guaranteed that on the game field there is at least one Packman and at least one asterisk.. Output specification: Print minimum possible time after which Packmen can eat all asterisks.\nDemo input: ['7\\n*..P*P*\\n', '10\\n.**PP.*P.*\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: In the first example Packman in position 4 will move to the left and will eat asterisk in position 1. He will spend 3 time units on it. During the same 3 time units Packman in position 6 will eat both of neighboring with it asterisks. For example, it can move to the left and eat asterisk in position 5 (in 1 time unit) and then move from the position 5 to the right and eat asterisk in the position 7 (in 2 time units). So in 3 time units Packmen will eat all asterisks on the game field.\n\nIn the second example Packman in the position 4 will move to the left and after 2 time units will eat asterisks in positions 3 and 2. Packmen in positions 5 and 8 will move to the right and in 2 time units will eat asterisks in positions 7 and 10, respectively. So 2 time units is enough for Packmen to eat all asterisks on the game field."}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.\n\nThere are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.\n\nOfficer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:\n -  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$; -  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. \nFor example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\n\nThe structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.\n\nFormally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.\n\nBerland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.\n\nSuppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ \u2014 one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.\n\nLet's look at the following example:\n\nIf officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.\n\nIf officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.\n\nTo answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.\n\nYou should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of officers in Berland army and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i &lt; i$), where $p_i$ is the index of the direct superior of the officer having the index $i$. The commander has index $1$ and doesn't have any superiors.\n\nThe next $q$ lines describe the queries. The $i$-th query is given as a pair ($u_i, k_i$) ($1 \\le u_i, k_i \\le n$), where $u_i$ is the index of the officer which starts spreading a command, and $k_i$ is the index of the required officer in the command spreading sequence.. Output specification: Print $q$ numbers, where the $i$-th number is the officer at the position $k_i$ in the list which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if it starts spreading from officer $u_i$. Print \"-1\" if the number of officers which receive the command is less than $k_i$.\n\nYou should process queries independently. They do not affect each other.\nDemo input: ['9 6\\n1 1 1 3 5 3 5 7\\n3 1\\n1 5\\n3 4\\n7 3\\n1 8\\n1 9\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n6\\n8\\n-1\\n9\\n4\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

He has even invented a new variant of chess, which he named \u00abPawnChess\u00bb.\n\nThis new game is played on a board consisting of 8 rows and 8 columns. At the beginning of every game some black and white pawns are placed on the board. The number of black pawns placed is not necessarily equal to the number of white pawns placed. \n\nLets enumerate rows and columns with integers from 1 to 8. Rows are numbered from top to bottom, while columns are numbered from left to right. Now we denote as (*r*,<=*c*) the cell located at the row *r* and at the column *c*.\n\nThere are always two players A and B playing the game. Player A plays with white pawns, while player B plays with black ones. The goal of player A is to put any of his pawns to the row 1, while player B tries to put any of his pawns to the row 8. As soon as any of the players completes his goal the game finishes immediately and the succeeded player is declared a winner.\n\nPlayer A moves first and then they alternate turns. On his move player A must choose exactly one white pawn and move it one step upward and player B (at his turn) must choose exactly one black pawn and move it one step down. Any move is possible only if the targeted cell is empty. It's guaranteed that for any scenario of the game there will always be at least one move available for any of the players.\n\nMoving upward means that the pawn located in (*r*,<=*c*) will go to the cell (*r*<=-<=1,<=*c*), while moving down means the pawn located in (*r*,<=*c*) will go to the cell (*r*<=+<=1,<=*c*). Again, the corresponding cell must be empty, i.e. not occupied by any other pawn of any color.\n\nGiven the initial disposition of the board, determine who wins the game if both players play optimally. Note that there will always be a winner due to the restriction that for any game scenario both players will have some moves available.\nInput specification: The input consists of the board description given in eight lines, each line contains eight characters. Character 'B' is used to denote a black pawn, and character 'W' represents a white pawn. Empty cell is marked with '.'. \n\nIt's guaranteed that there will not be white pawns on the first row neither black pawns on the last row..

If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them. The numbers must be printed in ascending order. \n\nIf the counterexample does not exist, print the single number -1.\nDemo input: ['2 4\\n', '10 11\\n', '900000000000000009 900000000000000029\\n'], Demo output: ['2 3 4\\n', '-1\\n', '900000000000000009 900000000000000010 900000000000000021\\n']\nNote: In the first sample pair (2,\u20094) is not coprime and pairs (2,\u20093) and (3,\u20094) are. \n\nIn the second sample you cannot form a group of three distinct integers, so the answer is -1. \n\nIn the third sample it is easy to see that numbers 900000000000000009 and 900000000000000021 are divisible by three."}]}}

Go 1 unit towards the negative direction, denoted as '-' \nBut the Wi-Fi condition is so poor that Dreamoon's smartphone reports some of the commands can't be recognized and Dreamoon knows that some of them might even be wrong though successfully recognized. Dreamoon decides to follow every recognized command and toss a fair coin to decide those unrecognized ones (that means, he moves to the 1 unit to the negative or positive direction with the same probability 0.5). \n\nYou are given an original list of commands sent by Drazil and list received by Dreamoon. What is the probability that Dreamoon ends in the position originally supposed to be final by Drazil's commands?\nInput specification: The first line contains a string *s*1 \u2014 the commands Drazil sends to Dreamoon, this string consists of only the characters in the set {'+', '-'}. \n\nThe second line contains a string *s*2 \u2014 the commands Dreamoon's smartphone recognizes, this string consists of only the characters in the set {'+', '-', '?'}. '?' denotes an unrecognized command.\n\nLengths of two strings are equal and do not exceed 10.. Output specification: Output a single real number corresponding to the probability. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10<=-<=9.\nDemo input: ['++-+-\\n+-+-+\\n', '+-+-\\n+-??\\n', '+++\\n??-\\n'], Demo output: ['1.000000000000\\n', '0.500000000000\\n', '0.000000000000\\n']\nNote: For the first sample, both *s*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub> and *s*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub> will lead Dreamoon to finish at the same position \u2009+\u20091. \n\nFor the second sample, *s*<sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub> will lead Dreamoon to finish at position 0, while there are four possibilites for *s*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>: {\"+-++\", \"+-+-\", \"+--+\", \"+---\"} with ending position {+2, 0, 0, -2} respectively. So there are 2 correct cases out of 4, so the probability of finishing at the correct position is 0.5. \n\nFor the third sample, *s*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub> could only lead us to finish at positions {+1, -1, -3}, so the probability to finish at the correct position \u2009+\u20093 is 0."}]}}

At first night he received embosser and was to take stock of the whole exposition.\n\nEmbosser is a special devise that allows to \"print\" the text of a plastic tape. Text is printed sequentially, character by character. The device consists of a wheel with a lowercase English letters written in a circle, static pointer to the current letter and a button that print the chosen letter. At one move it's allowed to rotate the alphabetic wheel one step clockwise or counterclockwise. Initially, static pointer points to letter 'a'. Other letters are located as shown on the picture:\n\nAfter Grigoriy add new item to the base he has to print its name on the plastic tape and attach it to the corresponding exhibit. It's not required to return the wheel to its initial position with pointer on the letter 'a'.\n\nOur hero is afraid that some exhibits may become alive and start to attack him, so he wants to print the names as fast as possible. Help him, for the given string find the minimum number of rotations of the wheel required to print it.\nInput specification: The only line of input contains the name of some exhibit\u00a0\u2014 the non-empty string consisting of no more than 100 characters.

Let's denote the cell at the intersection of the *r*-th row and the *c*-th column as (*r*,<=*c*).\n\nInitially the pig stands in cell (1,<=1), and in the end she wants to be in cell (*n*,<=*m*). Since the pig is in a hurry to get home, she can go from cell (*r*,<=*c*), only to either cell (*r*<=+<=1,<=*c*) or (*r*,<=*c*<=+<=1). She cannot leave the forest.\n\nThe forest, where the pig is, is very unusual. Some cells of the forest similar to each other, and some look very different. Peppa enjoys taking pictures and at every step she takes a picture of the cell where she is now. The path through the forest is considered to be beautiful if photographs taken on her way, can be viewed in both forward and in reverse order, showing the same sequence of photos. More formally, the line formed by the cells in order of visiting should be a palindrome (you can read a formal definition of a palindrome in the previous problem).\n\nCount the number of beautiful paths from cell (1,<=1) to cell (*n*,<=*m*).

A natural problem occurred: on the one hand, it is not clear how many T-shirts of what sizes should be ordered, and on the other hand, one doesn't want to order too many T-shirts (and we do not exactly paper the walls with the oversupply). After considerable brain racking and some pre-estimating, the sponsor representatives ordered a certain number of T-shirts of sizes S, M, L, XL and XXL. The T-shirts turned out to bring good luck, that's why on the contest day there built up a line of *K* participants willing to get one. Every contestant is characterized by his/her desired T-shirt size (so it happens that for all the participants it is also one of the sizes S, M, L, XL and XXL). The participants come up to get a T-shirt one by one and try to choose the most suitable one, choosing it like this. If there is still a T-shirt of the optimal size left, that he/she takes it without further ado. Otherwise the contestant would prefer to choose a T-shirt with the size as close to the optimal one as possible (the distance between neighboring sizes is considered equal to one). If the variant of choice is not unique, the contestant will take a T-shirt of a bigger size (in case he/she grows more). For example, for a person whose optimal size is L the preference list looks like this: L, XL, M, XXL, S. Using the data on how many T-shirts of every size had been ordered by the organizers, on the size of contestants in the line determine who got a T-shirt of what size.\nInput specification: The first line contains five non-negative integers *N**S*,<=*N**M*,<=*N**L*,<=*N**XL*,<=*N**XXL* not exceeding 1000 which represent the number of T-shirts of the corresponding sizes. The second line contains an integer *K* (1<=\u2264<=*K*<=\u2264<=1000) which represents the number of participants. The next *K* lines contain the optimal T-shirt sizes for the contestants. The sizes are given in the order in which the participants stand in the line. It is guaranteed that *N**S*<=+<=*N**M*<=+<=*N**L*<=+<=*N**XL*<=+<=*N**XXL*<=\u2265<=*K*.. Output specification: For each contestant, print a line containing the size of the T-shirt he/she got.\nDemo input: ['1 0 2 0 1\\n3\\nXL\\nXXL\\nM\\n'], Demo output: ['XXL\\nL\\nL\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

The debts still mean the same but the total sum of the debts now equals 20 rubles.\n\nThis task is a generalisation of a described example. Imagine that your group of friends has *n* people and you know the debts between the people. Optimize the given debts without changing their meaning. In other words, finally for each friend the difference between the total money he should give and the total money he should take must be the same.

For example, the following years are leap: 2000, 2004, but years 1900 and 2018 are not leap.\n\nIn this problem you are given *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=24) integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*, and you have to check if these integers could be durations in days of *n* consecutive months, according to Gregorian calendar.

Xenia is currently studying bit operations. To better understand how they work, Xenia decided to calculate some value *v* for *a*.\n\nNamely, it takes several iterations to calculate value *v*. At the first iteration, Xenia writes a new sequence *a*1\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*2,<=*a*3\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*4,<=...,<=*a*2*n*<=-<=1\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*2*n*, consisting of 2*n*<=-<=1 elements. In other words, she writes down the bit-wise OR of adjacent elements of sequence *a*. At the second iteration, Xenia writes the bitwise exclusive OR of adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the first iteration. At the third iteration Xenia writes the bitwise OR of the adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the second iteration. And so on; the operations of bitwise exclusive OR and bitwise OR alternate. In the end, she obtains a sequence consisting of one element, and that element is *v*.\n\nLet's consider an example. Suppose that sequence *a*<==<=(1,<=2,<=3,<=4). Then let's write down all the transformations (1,<=2,<=3,<=4) <=\u2192<= (1\u00a0*or*\u00a02<==<=3,<=3\u00a0*or*\u00a04<==<=7) <=\u2192<= (3\u00a0*xor*\u00a07<==<=4). The result is *v*<==<=4.\n\nYou are given Xenia's initial sequence. But to calculate value *v* for a given sequence would be too easy, so you are given additional *m* queries. Each query is a pair of integers *p*,<=*b*. Query *p*,<=*b* means that you need to perform the assignment *a**p*<==<=*b*. After each query, you need to print the new value *v* for the new sequence *a*.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=17,<=1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105).

He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10*k*.\n\nIn the given number of *n* Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10*k*. For example, if *k*<==<=3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 103<==<=1000.\n\nWrite a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number *n*, so that the result is divisible by 10*k*. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the answer exists.\nInput specification: The only line of the input contains two integer numbers *n* and *k* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2<=000<=000<=000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Thus, for example, for example, you can cut a substring out from string 'TEMPLATE' and get string 'TEMPLE' (if you cut out string AT), 'PLATE' (if you cut out TEM), 'T' (if you cut out EMPLATE), etc.\n\nHelp the organizers of the round determine whether it is possible to cut out of the banner some substring in such a way that the remaining parts formed word CODEFORCES.\nInput specification: The single line of the input contains the word written on the banner.

When a player makes a move, he chooses a hole which contains a positive number of stones. He takes all the stones inside it and then redistributes these stones one by one in the next holes in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\nNote that the counter-clockwise order means if the player takes the stones from hole $i$, he will put one stone in the $(i+1)$-th hole, then in the $(i+2)$-th, etc. If he puts a stone in the $14$-th hole, the next one will be put in the first hole.\n\nAfter the move, the player collects all the stones from holes that contain even number of stones.

For example, if *k*<==<=1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if *k*<==<=2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.\n\nYour goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.\n\nThe second line contains a string of length *n* consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.. Output specification: If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length *k*), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print \"YES\" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\nDemo input: ['5 2\\n#G#T#\\n', '6 1\\nT....G\\n', '7 3\\nT..#..G\\n', '6 2\\n..GT..\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'YES\\n', 'NO\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.\n\nIn the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free\u00a0\u2014 he can get there by jumping left 5 times.\n\nIn the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.\n\nIn the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Each of you probably has your personal experience of riding public transportation and buying tickets. After a person buys a ticket (which traditionally has an even number of digits), he usually checks whether the ticket is lucky. Let us remind you that a ticket is lucky if the sum of digits in its first half matches the sum of digits in its second half.\n\nBut of course, not every ticket can be lucky. Far from it! Moreover, sometimes one look at a ticket can be enough to say right away that the ticket is not lucky. So, let's consider the following unluckiness criterion that can definitely determine an unlucky ticket. We'll say that a ticket is definitely unlucky if each digit from the first half corresponds to some digit from the second half so that each digit from the first half is strictly less than the corresponding digit from the second one or each digit from the first half is strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second one. Each digit should be used exactly once in the comparisons. In other words, there is such bijective correspondence between the digits of the first and the second half of the ticket, that either each digit of the first half turns out strictly less than the corresponding digit of the second half or each digit of the first half turns out strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second half.\n\nFor example, ticket 2421 meets the following unluckiness criterion and will not be considered lucky (the sought correspondence is 2<=&gt;<=1 and 4<=&gt;<=2), ticket 0135 also meets the criterion (the sought correspondence is 0<=&lt;<=3 and 1<=&lt;<=5), and ticket 3754 does not meet the criterion. \n\nYou have a ticket in your hands, it contains 2*n* digits.

Write a python script for the following problem: Developers often face with regular expression patterns. A pattern is usually defined as a string consisting of characters and metacharacters that sets the rules for your search. These patterns are most often used to check whether a particular string meets the certain rules.\n\nIn this task, a pattern will be a string consisting of small English letters and question marks ('?'). The question mark in the pattern is a metacharacter that denotes an arbitrary small letter of the English alphabet. We will assume that a string matches the pattern if we can transform the string into the pattern by replacing the question marks by the appropriate characters. For example, string aba matches patterns: ???, ??a, a?a, aba.\n\nProgrammers that work for the R1 company love puzzling each other (and themselves) with riddles. One of them is as follows: you are given *n* patterns of the same length, you need to find a pattern that contains as few question marks as possible, and intersects with each of the given patterns. Two patterns intersect if there is a string that matches both the first and the second pattern. Can you solve this riddle?\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of patterns. Next *n* lines contain the patterns.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the patterns can only consist of small English letters and symbols '?'. All patterns are non-empty and have the same length. The total length of all the patterns does not exceed 105 characters.. Output specification: In a single line print the answer to the problem \u2014 the pattern with the minimal number of signs '?', which intersects with each of the given ones.

Pattern xab intersects with each of the given patterns. Pattern ??? also intersects with each of the given patterns, but it contains more question signs, hence it is not an optimal answer. Clearly, xab is the optimal answer, because it doesn't contain any question sign. There are a lot of other optimal answers, for example: aab, bab, cab, dab and so on."}]}}

He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.\n\nOne day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ.

You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins.

If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too. You can pick coins with values 1,\u20092 or 2,\u20092. In any case, the minimum number of coins equals 2."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Vova is again playing some computer game, now an RPG. In the game Vova's character received a quest: to slay the fearsome monster called Modcrab.\n\nAfter two hours of playing the game Vova has tracked the monster and analyzed its tactics. The Modcrab has *h*2 health points and an attack power of *a*2. Knowing that, Vova has decided to buy a lot of strong healing potions and to prepare for battle.\n\nVova's character has *h*1 health points and an attack power of *a*1. Also he has a large supply of healing potions, each of which increases his current amount of health points by *c*1 when Vova drinks a potion. All potions are identical to each other. It is guaranteed that *c*1<=&gt;<=*a*2.\n\nThe battle consists of multiple phases. In the beginning of each phase, Vova can either attack the monster (thus reducing its health by *a*1) or drink a healing potion (it increases Vova's health by *c*1; Vova's health can exceed *h*1). Then, if the battle is not over yet, the Modcrab attacks Vova, reducing his health by *a*2. The battle ends when Vova's (or Modcrab's) health drops to 0 or lower. It is possible that the battle ends in a middle of a phase after Vova's attack.\n\nOf course, Vova wants to win the fight. But also he wants to do it as fast as possible. So he wants to make up a strategy that will allow him to win the fight after the minimum possible number of phases.\n\nHelp Vova to make up a strategy! You may assume that Vova never runs out of healing potions, and that he can always win.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *h*1, *a*1, *c*1 (1<=\u2264<=*h*1,<=*a*1<=\u2264<=100, 2<=\u2264<=*c*1<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 Vova's health, Vova's attack power and the healing power of a potion.\n\nThe second line contains two integers *h*2, *a*2 (1<=\u2264<=*h*2<=\u2264<=100, 1<=\u2264<=*a*2<=&lt;<=*c*1) \u2014 the Modcrab's health and his attack power..

Rubik spends exactly 1 hour on completing any part on any computer. -  Move from the 1-st computer to the 2-nd one. Rubik spends exactly 1 hour on that. -  Move from the 1-st computer to the 3-rd one. Rubik spends exactly 2 hours on that. -  Move from the 2-nd computer to the 1-st one. Rubik spends exactly 2 hours on that. -  Move from the 2-nd computer to the 3-rd one. Rubik spends exactly 1 hour on that. -  Move from the 3-rd computer to the 1-st one. Rubik spends exactly 1 hour on that. -  Move from the 3-rd computer to the 2-nd one. Rubik spends exactly 2 hours on that. \nHelp Rubik to find the minimum number of hours he will need to complete all parts of the game. Initially Rubik can be located at the computer he considers necessary.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200) \u2014 the number of game parts. The next line contains *n* integers, the *i*-th integer \u2014 *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=3) represents the number of the computer, on which you can complete the game part number *i*. \n\nNext *n* lines contain descriptions of game parts. The *i*-th line first contains integer *k**i* (0<=\u2264<=*k**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1), then *k**i* distinct integers *a**i*,<=*j* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=*n*;\u00a0*a**i*,<=*j*<=\u2260<=*i*) \u2014 the numbers of parts to complete before part *i*.\n\nNumbers on all lines are separated by single spaces. You can assume that the parts of the game are numbered from 1 to *n* in some way. It is guaranteed that there are no cyclic dependencies between the parts of the game.. Output specification: On a single line print the answer to the problem.\nDemo input: ['1\\n1\\n0\\n', '5\\n2 2 1 1 3\\n1 5\\n2 5 1\\n2 5 4\\n1 5\\n0\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '7\\n']\nNote: Note to the second sample: before the beginning of the game the best strategy is to stand by the third computer. First we complete part 5. Then we go to the 1-st computer and complete parts 3 and 4. Then we go to the 2-nd computer and complete parts 1 and 2. In total we get 1+1+2+1+2, which equals 7 hours."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective. You are able to cope with it not worse, aren't you?\nInput specification: The first and single line contains two integers *A* and *B* (1<=\u2264<=*A*,<=*B*<=\u2264<=109,<=*min*(*A*,<=*B*)<=\u2264<=12)..

Each floor has $m$ sections with a single corridor connecting all of them. The sections are enumerated from $1$ to $m$ along the corridor, and all sections with equal numbers on different floors are located exactly one above the other.

We can denote sections with pairs of integers $(i, j)$, where $i$ is the floor, and $j$ is the section number on the floor.\n\nThe guests can walk along the corridor on each floor, use stairs and elevators. Each stairs or elevator occupies all sections $(1, x)$, $(2, x)$, $\\ldots$, $(n, x)$ for some $x$ between $1$ and $m$. All sections not occupied with stairs or elevators contain guest rooms. It takes one time unit to move between neighboring sections on the same floor or to move one floor up or down using stairs. It takes one time unit to move up to $v$ floors in any direction using an elevator. You can assume you don't have to wait for an elevator, and the time needed to enter or exit an elevator is negligible.\n\nYou are to process $q$ queries.

Then both players name the digits written on their cards one by one. If two digits are not equal, then the player, whose digit is smaller gets a flick (knock in the forehead usually made with a forefinger) from the other player. For example, if *n*<==<=3, Sherlock's card is 123 and Moriarty's card has number 321, first Sherlock names 1 and Moriarty names 3 so Sherlock gets a flick. Then they both digit 2 so no one gets a flick. Finally, Sherlock names 3, while Moriarty names 1 and gets a flick.\n\nOf course, Sherlock will play honestly naming digits one by one in the order they are given, while Moriary, as a true villain, plans to cheat. He is going to name his digits in some other order (however, he is not going to change the overall number of occurences of each digit). For example, in case above Moriarty could name 1, 2, 3 and get no flicks at all, or he can name 2, 3 and 1 to give Sherlock two flicks.\n\nYour goal is to find out the minimum possible number of flicks Moriarty will get (no one likes flicks) and the maximum possible number of flicks Sherlock can get from Moriarty.

He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.\n\nOne day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.\nInput specification: There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number. It is guaranteed that the numbers are made from 0 and 1 only and that their length is same. The numbers may start with 0. The length of each number doesn't exceed 100.. Output specification: Write one line \u2014 the corresponding answer. Do not omit the leading 0s.\nDemo input: ['1010100\\n0100101\\n', '000\\n111\\n', '1110\\n1010\\n', '01110\\n01100\\n'], Demo output: ['1110001\\n', '111\\n', '0100\\n', '00010\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

If a word contains an equal number of uppercase and lowercase letters, you should replace all the letters with lowercase ones. For example, maTRIx should be replaced by matrix. Your task is to use the given method on one given word.\nInput specification: The first line contains a word *s* \u2014 it consists of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and possesses the length from 1 to 100..

For example, if *t*<==<=\"nastya\" and *a*<==<=[4,<=1,<=5,<=3,<=2,<=6] then removals make the following sequence of words \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\"  \"nastya\".\n\nSergey knows this permutation. His goal is to stop his sister at some point and continue removing by himself to get the word *p*. Since Nastya likes this activity, Sergey wants to stop her as late as possible.

She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two.

However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins.

Write a python script for the following problem: A few years ago, Hitagi encountered a giant crab, who stole the whole of her body weight. Ever since, she tried to avoid contact with others, for fear that this secret might be noticed.\n\nTo get rid of the oddity and recover her weight, a special integer sequence is needed. Hitagi's sequence has been broken for a long time, but now Kaiki provides an opportunity.\n\nHitagi's sequence *a* has a length of *n*. Lost elements in it are denoted by zeros. Kaiki provides another sequence *b*, whose length *k* equals the number of lost elements in *a* (i.e. the number of zeros). Hitagi is to replace each zero in *a* with an element from *b* so that each element in *b* should be used exactly once. Hitagi knows, however, that, apart from 0, no integer occurs in *a* and *b* more than once in total.\n\nIf the resulting sequence is not an increasing sequence, then it has the power to recover Hitagi from the oddity. You are to determine whether this is possible, or Kaiki's sequence is just another fake. In other words, you should detect whether it is possible to replace each zero in *a* with an integer from *b* so that each integer from *b* is used exactly once, and the resulting sequence is not increasing.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains two space-separated positive integers *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the lengths of sequence *a* and *b* respectively.\n\nThe second line contains *n* space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=200) \u2014 Hitagi's broken sequence with exactly *k* zero elements.\n\nThe third line contains *k* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**k* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=200) \u2014 the elements to fill into Hitagi's sequence.\n\nInput guarantees that apart from 0, no integer occurs in *a* and *b* more than once in total..

Write a python script for the following problem: In some country live wizards. They love to ride trolleybuses.\n\nA city in this country has a trolleybus depot with *n* trolleybuses. Every day the trolleybuses leave the depot, one by one and go to the final station. The final station is at a distance of *d* meters from the depot. We know for the *i*-th trolleybus that it leaves at the moment of time *t**i* seconds, can go at a speed of no greater than *v**i* meters per second, and accelerate with an acceleration no greater than *a* meters per second squared. A trolleybus can decelerate as quickly as you want (magic!). It can change its acceleration as fast as you want, as well. Note that the maximum acceleration is the same for all trolleys.\n\nDespite the magic the trolleys are still powered by an electric circuit and cannot overtake each other (the wires are to blame, of course). If a trolleybus catches up with another one, they go together one right after the other until they arrive at the final station. Also, the drivers are driving so as to arrive at the final station as quickly as possible.\n\nYou, as head of the trolleybuses' fans' club, are to determine for each trolley the minimum time by which it can reach the final station. At the time of arrival at the destination station the trolleybus does not necessarily have zero speed. When a trolley is leaving the depot, its speed is considered equal to zero. From the point of view of physics, the trolleybuses can be considered as material points, and also we should ignore the impact on the speed of a trolley bus by everything, except for the acceleration and deceleration provided by the engine.\nInput specification: The first input line contains three space-separated integers *n*, *a*, *d* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*d*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 the number of trolleybuses, their maximum acceleration and the distance from the depot to the final station, correspondingly.\n\nNext *n* lines contain pairs of integers *t**i* *v**i* (0<=\u2264<=*t*1<=&lt;<=*t*2...<=&lt;<=*t**n*<=-<=1<=&lt;<=*t**n*<=\u2264<=106, 1<=\u2264<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 the time when the *i*-th trolleybus leaves the depot and its maximum speed, correspondingly. The numbers in the lines are separated by spaces.. Output specification: For each trolleybus print a single line the time it arrives to the final station. Print the times for the trolleybuses in the order in which the trolleybuses are given in the input.

The trolleybuses will go the remaining 9489.5 meters together at speed 10 meters per second. As a result, both trolleybuses will arrive to the final station by the moment of time 1000.5 seconds. The third trolleybus will not catch up with them. It will arrive to the final station by the moment of time 11000.05 seconds."}]}}

There is an urgent need to fix it. You have chosen to make the numbers of the items sequential, starting with 1. Changing a number is quite a time-consuming process, and you would like to make maximum use of the current numbering.\n\nYou have been given information on current inventory numbers for *n* items in the company. Renumber items so that their inventory numbers form a permutation of numbers from 1 to *n* by changing the number of as few items as possible. Let us remind you that a set of *n* numbers forms a permutation if all the numbers are in the range from 1 to *n*, and no two numbers are equal.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n*\u00a0\u2014 the number of items (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105).\n\nThe second line contains *n* numbers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the initial inventory numbers of the items.. Output specification: Print *n* numbers\u00a0\u2014 the final inventory numbers of the items in the order they occur in the input. If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.\nDemo input: ['3\\n1 3 2\\n', '4\\n2 2 3 3\\n', '1\\n2\\n'], Demo output: ['1 3 2 \\n', '2 1 3 4 \\n', '1 \\n']\nNote: In the first test the numeration is already a permutation, so there is no need to change anything.\n\nIn the second test there are two pairs of equal numbers, in each pair you need to replace one number.\n\nIn the third test you need to replace 2 by 1, as the numbering should start from one."}]}}

Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis.

Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!).

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made.

He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

The elements of the array are enumerated from $1$ to $n$. You perform $q$ operations on the array. The $i$-th operation is described with three integers $l_i$, $r_i$ and $x_i$ ($1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$, $1 \\leq x_i \\leq n$) and means that you should add $x_i$ to each of the elements with indices $l_i, l_i + 1, \\ldots, r_i$. After all operations you should find the maximum in the array.\n\nGrisha is clever, so he solved the problem quickly.\n\nHowever something went wrong inside his head and now he thinks of the following question: \"consider we applied some subset of the operations to the array. What are the possible values of the maximum in the array?\"\n\nHelp Grisha, find all integers $y$ between $1$ and $n$ such that if you apply some subset (possibly empty) of the operations, then the maximum in the array becomes equal to $y$.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \\leq n, q \\leq 10^{4}$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array and the number of queries in the initial problem.\n\nThe following $q$ lines contain queries, one per line.

If you consider the subset only of the first query, the maximum is equal to $1$. If you take only the second query, the maximum equals to $2$. If you take the first two queries, the maximum becomes $3$. If you take only the fourth query, the maximum becomes $4$. If you take the fourth query and something more, the maximum becomes greater that $n$, so you shouldn't print it.\n\nIn the second example you can take the first query to obtain $1$. You can take only the second query to obtain $2$. You can take all queries to obtain $3$.\n\nIn the third example you can obtain the following maximums:\n -  You can achieve the maximim of $2$ by using queries: $(1)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $3$ by using queries: $(2)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $5$ by using queries: $(1, 2)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $6$ by using queries: $(3)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $8$ by using queries: $(1, 3)$. -  You can achieve the maximim of $9$ by using queries: $(2, 3)$."}]}}

If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=\u2264<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* \u2014 *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\nInput specification: The first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it..

Write a python script for the following problem: The whole world got obsessed with robots,and to keep pace with the progress, great Berland's programmer Draude decided to build his own robot. He was working hard at the robot. He taught it to walk the shortest path from one point to another, to record all its movements, but like in many Draude's programs, there was a bug \u2014 the robot didn't always walk the shortest path. Fortunately, the robot recorded its own movements correctly. Now Draude wants to find out when his robot functions wrong. Heh, if Draude only remembered the map of the field, where he tested the robot, he would easily say if the robot walked in the right direction or not. But the field map was lost never to be found, that's why he asks you to find out if there exist at least one map, where the path recorded by the robot is the shortest.\n\nThe map is an infinite checkered field, where each square is either empty, or contains an obstruction. It is also known that the robot never tries to run into the obstruction. By the recorded robot's movements find out if there exist at least one such map, that it is possible to choose for the robot a starting square (the starting square should be empty) such that when the robot moves from this square its movements coincide with the recorded ones (the robot doesn't run into anything, moving along empty squares only), and the path from the starting square to the end one is the shortest.\n\nIn one movement the robot can move into the square (providing there are no obstrutions in this square) that has common sides with the square the robot is currently in.\nInput specification: The first line of the input file contains the recording of the robot's movements.

Write a python script for the following problem: Attention: we lost all the test cases for this problem, so instead of solving the problem, we need you to generate test cases. We're going to give you the answer, and you need to print a test case that produces the given answer. The original problem is in the following paragraph.\n\nPeople don't use cash as often as they used to. Having a credit card solves some of the hassles of cash, such as having to receive change when you can't form the exact amount of money needed to purchase an item. Typically cashiers will give you as few coins as possible in change, but they don't have to. For example, if your change is 30 cents, a cashier could give you a 5 cent piece and a 25 cent piece, or they could give you three 10 cent pieces, or ten 1 cent pieces, two 5 cent pieces, and one 10 cent piece. Altogether there are 18 different ways to make 30 cents using only 1 cent pieces, 5 cent pieces, 10 cent pieces, and 25 cent pieces. Two ways are considered different if they contain a different number of at least one type of coin. Given the denominations of the coins and an amount of change to be made, how many different ways are there to make change?\n\nAs we mentioned before, we lost all the test cases for this problem, so we're actually going to give you the number of ways, and want you to produce a test case for which the number of ways is the given number. There could be many ways to achieve this (we guarantee there's always at least one), so you can print any, as long as it meets the constraints described below.\nInput specification: Input will consist of a single integer *A* (1<=\u2264<=*A*<=\u2264<=105), the desired number of ways..

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes. The second line contains integers *x**c* and *y**c* \u2014 the initial square's coordinates (1<=\u2264<=*x**c*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y**c*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nThe third line contains an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the number of vectors. Then follow *k* lines, each of them contains two integers *dx**i* and *dy**i* (|*dx**i*|,<=|*dy**i*|<=\u2264<=109,<=|*dx*|<=+<=|*dy*|<=\u2265<=1).. Output specification: Print the single number \u2014 the number of steps Vasya had made.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.\nDemo input: ['4 5\\n1 1\\n3\\n1 1\\n1 1\\n0 -2\\n', '10 10\\n1 2\\n1\\n-1 0\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: In the first sample Vasya is initially positioned at square (1,\u20091) and makes 3 steps by the first vector (1,\u20091). So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091). He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: After the contest in comparing numbers, Shapur's teacher found out that he is a real genius and that no one could possibly do the calculations faster than him even using a super computer!\n\nSome days before the contest, the teacher took a very simple-looking exam and all his *n* students took part in the exam. The teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation.\n\nUnfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.\n\nNow the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers.\n\nShapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: \n -  As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. -  As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include \"-\", \";\" and \"_\". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. -  The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600 -  My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. -  Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN -  You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong. Do this by writing \"WA\" for Wrong answer or \"ACC\" for a correct answer. -  I should remind you that none of the strings (initial strings or answers) are empty. -  Finally, do these as soon as possible. You have less than 2 hours to complete this.\nInput specification: The first three lines contain a string each. These are the initial strings. They consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). All the initial strings have length from 1 to 100, inclusively.\n\nIn the fourth line there is a single integer *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000), the number of students.\n\nNext *n* lines contain a student's answer each. It is guaranteed that the answer meets what the teacher said. Each answer iconsists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). Length is from 1 to 600, inclusively.. Output specification: For each student write in a different line.

Write a python script for the following problem: Inna loves sweets very much. That's why she decided to play a game called \"Sweet Matrix\".\n\nInna sees an *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* matrix and *k* candies. We'll index the matrix rows from 1 to *n* and the matrix columns from 1 to *m*. We'll represent the cell in the *i*-th row and *j*-th column as (*i*,<=*j*). Two cells (*i*,<=*j*) and (*p*,<=*q*) of the matrix are adjacent if |*i*<=-<=*p*|<=+<=|*j*<=-<=*q*|<==<=1. A path is a sequence of the matrix cells where each pair of neighbouring cells in the sequence is adjacent. We'll call the number of cells in the sequence the path's length.\n\nEach cell of the matrix can have at most one candy. Initiallly, all the cells are empty. Inna is trying to place each of the *k* candies in the matrix one by one. For each candy Inna chooses cell (*i*,<=*j*) that will contains the candy, and also chooses the path that starts in cell (1,<=1) and ends in cell (*i*,<=*j*) and doesn't contain any candies. After that Inna moves the candy along the path from cell (1,<=1) to cell (*i*,<=*j*), where the candy stays forever. If at some moment Inna can't choose a path for the candy, she loses. If Inna can place all the candies in the matrix in the described manner, then her penalty equals the sum of lengths of all the paths she has used.\n\nHelp Inna to minimize the penalty in the game.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains three integers *n*, *m* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=50,<=1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*\u00b7*m*).. Output specification: In the first line print an integer \u2014 Inna's minimum penalty in the game.\n\nIn the next *k* lines print the description of the path for each candy. The description of the path of the candy that is placed *i*-th should follow on the *i*-th line. The description of a path is a sequence of cells. Each cell must be written in the format (*i*,<=*j*), where *i* is the number of the row and *j* is the number of the column. You are allowed to print extra whitespaces in the line. If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.\n\nPlease follow the output format strictly! If your program passes the first pretest, then the output format is correct.\nDemo input: ['4 4 4\\n'], Demo output: ['8\\n(1,1) (2,1) (2,2)\\n(1,1) (1,2)\\n(1,1) (2,1)\\n(1,1)\\n']\nNote: Note to the sample. Initially the matrix is empty. Then Inna follows her first path, the path penalty equals the number of cells in it \u2014 3. Note that now no path can go through cell (2, 2), as it now contains a candy. The next two candies go to cells (1, 2) and (2, 1). Inna simply leaves the last candy at cell (1, 1), the path contains only this cell. The total penalty is: 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8.\n\nNote that Inna couldn't use cell (1, 1) to place, for instance, the third candy as in this case she couldn't have made the path for the fourth candy."}]}}

And she has found one!\n\nWhy not make her own Codeforces, with blackjack and other really cool stuff? Many people will surely be willing to visit this splendid shrine of high culture.\n\nIn Mainframe a standard pack of 52 cards is used to play blackjack. The pack contains cards of 13 values: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jacks, queens, kings and aces. Each value also exists in one of four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. Also, each card earns some value in points assigned to it: cards with value from two to ten earn from 2 to 10 points, correspondingly. An ace can either earn 1 or 11, whatever the player wishes. The picture cards (king, queen and jack) earn 10 points. The number of points a card earns does not depend on the suit. The rules of the game are very simple. The player gets two cards, if the sum of points of those cards equals *n*, then the player wins, otherwise the player loses.\n\nThe player has already got the first card, it's the queen of spades. To evaluate chances for victory, you should determine how many ways there are to get the second card so that the sum of points exactly equals *n*.\nInput specification: The only line contains *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=25) \u2014 the required sum of points..

Mike starts walking from his house located at the intersection number 1 and goes along some sequence of intersections.

Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*)..

A palindromic number is another matter. It is aesthetically pleasing, and it has a number of remarkable properties. Help Rikhail to convince the scientific community in this!\n\nLet us remind you that a number is called prime if it is integer larger than one, and is not divisible by any positive integer other than itself and one.\n\nRikhail calls a number a palindromic if it is integer, positive, and its decimal representation without leading zeros is a palindrome, i.e. reads the same from left to right and right to left.\n\nOne problem with prime numbers is that there are too many of them. Let's introduce the following notation: \u03c0(*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of primes no larger than *n*, *rub*(*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of palindromic numbers no larger than *n*.

Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*)..

The computer network of this corporation consists of *n* computers, some of them are connected by a cable. The computers are indexed by integers from 1 to *n*. It's known that any two computers connected by cable directly or through other computers\n\nPolycarpus decided to find out the network's topology. A network topology is the way of describing the network configuration, the scheme that shows the location and the connections of network devices.\n\nPolycarpus knows three main network topologies: bus, ring and star. A bus is the topology that represents a shared cable with all computers connected with it. In the ring topology the cable connects each computer only with two other ones. A star is the topology where all computers of a network are connected to the single central node.\n\nLet's represent each of these network topologies as a connected non-directed graph. A bus is a connected graph that is the only path, that is, the graph where all nodes are connected with two other ones except for some two nodes that are the beginning and the end of the path. A ring is a connected graph, where all nodes are connected with two other ones. A star is a connected graph, where a single central node is singled out and connected with all other nodes. For clarifications, see the picture.\n\nYou've got a connected non-directed graph that characterizes the computer network in Polycarpus' corporation. Help him find out, which topology type the given network is.

He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective. You are able to cope with it not worse, aren't you?\nInput specification: The first and single line contains two integers *A* and *B* (1<=\u2264<=*A*,<=*B*<=\u2264<=109,<=*min*(*A*,<=*B*)<=\u2264<=12).. Output specification: Print a single integer denoting the greatest common divisor of integers *A*! and *B*!.\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n'], Demo output: ['6\\n']\nNote: Consider the sample.\n\n4!\u2009=\u20091\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74\u2009=\u200924. 3!\u2009=\u20091\u00b72\u00b73\u2009=\u20096. The greatest common divisor of integers 24 and 6 is exactly 6."}]}}

In the course of the game the number of points is registered in the line \"name score\", where name is a player's name, and score is the number of points gained in this round, which is an integer number. If score is negative, this means that the player has lost in the round. So, if two or more players have the maximum number of points (say, it equals to *m*) at the end of the game, than wins the one of them who scored at least *m* points first. Initially each player has 0 points. It's guaranteed that at the end of the game at least one player has a positive number of points.\nInput specification: The first line contains an integer number *n* (1<=<=\u2264<=<=*n*<=<=\u2264<=<=1000), *n* is the number of rounds played. Then follow *n* lines, containing the information about the rounds in \"name score\" format in chronological order, where name is a string of lower-case Latin letters with the length from 1 to 32, and score is an integer number between -1000 and 1000, inclusive.. Output specification: Print the name of the winner.\nDemo input: ['3\\nmike 3\\nandrew 5\\nmike 2\\n', '3\\nandrew 3\\nandrew 2\\nmike 5\\n'], Demo output: ['andrew\\n', 'andrew\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Having learned the news, the colonel ordered to all *n* squad soldiers to line up on the parade ground.\n\nBy the military charter the soldiers should stand in the order of non-increasing of their height.

Please note that the way other solders are positioned does not matter, including the case when there are several soldiers whose height is maximum or minimum. Only the heights of the first and the last soldier are important.\n\nFor example, the general considers the sequence of heights (4, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1) correct and the sequence (4, 3, 1, 2, 2) wrong.\n\nWithin one second the colonel can swap any two neighboring soldiers.

He hates trains, so he has decided to get from one city to another by car.\n\nThe path from Moscow to Saratov can be represented as a straight line (well, it's not that straight in reality, but in this problem we will consider it to be straight), and the distance between Moscow and Saratov is $n$ km. Let's say that Moscow is situated at the point with coordinate $0$ km, and Saratov \u2014 at coordinate $n$ km.\n\nDriving for a long time may be really difficult. Formally, if Leha has already covered $i$ kilometers since he stopped to have a rest, he considers the difficulty of covering $(i + 1)$-th kilometer as $a_{i + 1}$. It is guaranteed that for every $i \\in [1, n - 1]$ $a_i \\le a_{i + 1}$. The difficulty of the journey is denoted as the sum of difficulties of each kilometer in the journey.\n\nFortunately, there may be some rest sites between Moscow and Saratov. Every integer point from $1$ to $n - 1$ may contain a rest site. When Leha enters a rest site, he may have a rest, and the next kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the kilometer after it \u2014 difficulty $a_2$, and so on.\n\nFor example, if $n = 5$ and there is a rest site in coordinate $2$, the difficulty of journey will be $2a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3$: the first kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the second one \u2014 $a_2$, then Leha will have a rest, and the third kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the fourth \u2014 $a_2$, and the last one \u2014 $a_3$. Another example: if $n = 7$ and there are rest sites in coordinates $1$ and $5$, the difficulty of Leha's journey is $3a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3 + a_4$.\n\nLeha doesn't know which integer points contain rest sites. So he has to consider every possible situation. Obviously, there are $2^{n - 1}$ different distributions of rest sites (two distributions are different if there exists some point $x$ such that it contains a rest site in exactly one of these distributions).

What is the minimum amount of gold Vova needs to spend in order to finish the quest?\n\nTake a look at the notes if you think you haven't understood the problem completely.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integer numbers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105,<=0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of characters in Overcity and the number of pairs of friends.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integer numbers *c**i* (0<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the amount of gold *i*-th character asks to start spreading the rumor.\n\nThen *m* lines follow, each containing a pair of numbers (*x**i*,<=*y**i*) which represent that characters *x**i* and *y**i* are friends (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, *x**i*<=\u2260<=*y**i*). It is guaranteed that each pair is listed at most once..

A haiku masterpiece contains a description of a moment in those three phrases. Every word is important in a small poem, which is why haiku are rich with symbols. Each word has a special meaning, a special role. The main principle of haiku is to say much using a few words.\n\nTo simplify the matter, in the given problem we will consider that the number of syllable in the phrase is equal to the number of vowel letters there. Only the following letters are regarded as vowel letters: \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\" and \"u\".\n\nThree phases from a certain poem are given. Determine whether it is haiku or not.\nInput specification: The input data consists of three lines. The length of each line is between 1 and 100, inclusive. The *i*-th line contains the *i*-th phrase of the poem. Each phrase consists of one or more words, which are separated by one or more spaces. A word is a non-empty sequence of lowercase Latin letters. Leading and/or trailing spaces in phrases are allowed. Every phrase has at least one non-space character. See the example for clarification.. Output specification: Print \"YES\" (without the quotes) if the poem is a haiku.

Dot wanted to know for sure what were her chances to visit Transylvania.\n\nIt is known that Yakko and Wakko are true gentlemen, that's why if they have the same amount of points with Dot, they will let Dot win.\nInput specification: The only line of the input file contains two natural numbers Y and W \u2014 the results of Yakko's and Wakko's die rolls.. Output specification: Output the required probability in the form of irreducible fraction in format \u00abA/B\u00bb, where A \u2014 the numerator, and B \u2014 the denominator. If the required probability equals to zero, output \u00ab0/1\u00bb. If the required probability equals to 1, output \u00ab1/1\u00bb.\nDemo input: ['4 2\\n'], Demo output: ['1/2\\n']\nNote: Dot will go to Transylvania, if she is lucky to roll 4, 5 or 6 points."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: While Farmer John rebuilds his farm in an unfamiliar portion of Bovinia, Bessie is out trying some alternative jobs. In her new gig as a reporter, Bessie needs to know about programming competition results as quickly as possible. When she covers the 2016 Robot Rap Battle Tournament, she notices that all of the robots operate under deterministic algorithms. In particular, robot *i* will beat robot *j* if and only if robot *i* has a higher skill level than robot *j*. And if robot *i* beats robot *j* and robot *j* beats robot *k*, then robot *i* will beat robot *k*. Since rapping is such a subtle art, two robots can never have the same skill level.\n\nGiven the results of the rap battles in the order in which they were played, determine the minimum number of first rap battles that needed to take place before Bessie could order all of the robots by skill level.\nInput specification: The first line of the input consists of two integers, the number of robots *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000) and the number of rap battles *m* ().\n\nThe next *m* lines describe the results of the rap battles in the order they took place. Each consists of two integers *u**i* and *v**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, *u**i*<=\u2260<=*v**i*), indicating that robot *u**i* beat robot *v**i* in the *i*-th rap battle. No two rap battles involve the same pair of robots.\n\nIt is guaranteed that at least one ordering of the robots satisfies all *m* relations.. Output specification: Print the minimum *k* such that the ordering of the robots by skill level is uniquely defined by the first *k* rap battles. If there exists more than one ordering that satisfies all *m* relations, output -1.\nDemo input: ['4 5\\n2 1\\n1 3\\n2 3\\n4 2\\n4 3\\n', '3 2\\n1 2\\n3 2\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, the robots from strongest to weakest must be (4,\u20092,\u20091,\u20093), which Bessie can deduce after knowing the results of the first four rap battles.\n\nIn the second sample, both (1,\u20093,\u20092) and (3,\u20091,\u20092) are possible orderings of the robots from strongest to weakest after both rap battles."}]}}
