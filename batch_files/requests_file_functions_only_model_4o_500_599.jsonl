Write a python script for the following problem: The Smart Beaver from ABBYY was offered a job of a screenwriter for the ongoing TV series. In particular, he needs to automate the hard decision: which main characters will get married by the end of the series.\n\nThere are *n* single men and *n* single women among the main characters. An opinion poll showed that viewers like several couples, and a marriage of any of them will make the audience happy. The Smart Beaver formalized this fact as *k* triples of numbers (*h*,<=*w*,<=*r*), where *h* is the index of the man, *w* is the index of the woman, and *r* is the measure of the audience's delight in case of the marriage of this couple. The same poll showed that the marriage of any other couple will leave the audience indifferent, so the screenwriters decided not to include any such marriages in the plot.\n\nThe script allows you to arrange several marriages between the heroes or not to arrange marriages at all. A subset of some of the *k* marriages is considered acceptable if each man and each woman is involved in at most one marriage of the subset (the series won't allow any divorces). The value of the acceptable set of marriages is the total delight the spectators will get from the marriages included in this set.\n\nObviously, there is a finite number of acceptable sets, and they all describe some variants of the script. The screenwriters do not want to choose a set with maximum value \u2014 it would make the plot too predictable. So the Smart Beaver offers the following option: sort all the acceptable sets in increasing order of value and choose the *t*-th set from the sorted list. Thus, *t*<==<=1 corresponds to a plot without marriages, *t*<==<=2 \u2014 to a single marriage resulting in minimal delight for the audience, and so on.\n\nHelp the Beaver to implement the algorithm for selecting the desired set.\nInput specification: The first input line contains integers *n*, *k* and *t* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*min*(100,<=*n*2), 1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105), separated by single spaces.

The length of the described path equals to (*k*<=-<=1). We assume that two cities lie in the same region if and only if, there is a path connecting these two cities.\n\nDuring the game events of two types take place:\n 1.  Andrew asks Dima about the length of the longest path in the region where city *x* lies. 1.  Andrew asks Dima to merge the region where city *x* lies with the region where city *y* lies. If the cities lie in the same region, then no merging is needed. Otherwise, you need to merge the regions as follows: choose a city from the first region, a city from the second region and connect them by a road so as to minimize the length of the longest path in the resulting region. If there are multiple ways to do so, you are allowed to choose any of them. \nDima finds it hard to execute Andrew's queries, so he asks you to help him. Help Dima.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *q* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105; 0<=\u2264<=*m*<=&lt;<=*n*; 1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of cities, the number of the roads we already have and the number of queries, correspondingly.\n\nEach of the following *m* lines contains two integers, *a**i* and *b**i* (*a**i*<=\u2260<=*b**i*; 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*). These numbers represent the road between cities *a**i* and *b**i*. There can be at most one road between two cities.\n\nEach of the following *q* lines contains one of the two events in the following format:\n -  1 *x**i*. It is the request Andrew gives to Dima to find the length of the maximum path in the region that contains city *x**i* (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=*n*).  2 *x**i* *y**i*. It is the request Andrew gives to Dima to merge the region that contains city *x**i* and the region that contains city *y**i* (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=*n*). Note, that *x**i* can be equal to *y**i*. . Output specification: For each event of the first type print the answer on a separate line.\nDemo input: ['6 0 6\\n2 1 2\\n2 3 4\\n2 5 6\\n2 3 2\\n2 5 3\\n1 1\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Her friend Dasha told Masha about a way to determine the phone number of one's Prince Charming through arithmancy. \n\nThe phone number is divined like that. First one needs to write down one's own phone numbers. For example, let's suppose that Masha's phone number is 12345. After that one should write her favorite digit from 0 to 9 under the first digit of her number. That will be the first digit of the needed number. For example, Masha's favorite digit is 9. The second digit is determined as a half sum of the second digit of Masha's number and the already written down first digit from her beloved one's number. In this case the arithmetic average equals to (2<=+<=9)<=/<=2<==<=5.5. Masha can round the number up or down, depending on her wishes. For example, she chooses the digit 5. Having written down the resulting digit under the second digit of her number, Masha moves to finding the third digit in the same way, i.e. finding the half sum the the third digit of her number and the second digit of the new number. The result is (5<=+<=3)<=/<=2<==<=4. In this case the answer is unique. Thus, every *i*-th digit is determined as an arithmetic average of the *i*-th digit of Masha's number and the *i*<=-<=1-th digit of her true love's number.

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$..

Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$."}]}}
