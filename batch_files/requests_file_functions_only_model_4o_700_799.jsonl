A field is represented by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*) \u2014 the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:\n -  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically. -  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally. -  A king moves one field in any direction \u2014 horizontally, vertically or diagonally. \nPetya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2)? At that, we assume that there are no more pieces besides this one on the board. Help him solve this problem.\nInput specification: The input contains four integers *r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2 (1<=\u2264<=*r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2<=\u2264<=8) \u2014 the coordinates of the starting and the final field.

So 5 is\u00a0not the next prime number for 2.\n\nOne cold April morning Panoramix predicted that soon Kakofonix will break free from his straitjacket, and this will be a black day for the residents of the Gallic countryside.\n\nPanoramix's prophecy tells that if some day Asterix and Obelix beat exactly *x* Roman soldiers, where *x* is a prime number, and next day they beat exactly *y* Roman soldiers, where *y* is the next prime number after *x*, then it's time to wait for Armageddon, for nothing can shut Kakofonix up while he sings his infernal song.\n\nYesterday the Gauls beat *n* Roman soldiers and it turned out that the number *n* was prime! Today their victims were a troop of *m* Romans (*m*<=&gt;<=*n*).

Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up \u2014 who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone.

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here.

Write a python script for the following problem: Imagine that you have a twin brother or sister. Having another person that looks exactly like you seems very unusual. It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.\n\nNow let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins. The second line contains a sequence of *n* integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the coins' values. All numbers are separated with spaces..

If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too. You can pick coins with values 1,\u20092 or 2,\u20092. In any case, the minimum number of coins equals 2."}]}}

Each spinner can, well, spin around an invisible magic axis. At a specific point in time, a spinner can take 4 positions shown below (each one rotated 90 degrees relative to the previous, with the fourth one followed by the first one):\n\nAfter the spinner was spun, it starts its rotation, which is described by a following algorithm: the spinner maintains its position for a second then majestically switches to the next position in clockwise or counter-clockwise order, depending on the direction the spinner was spun in.\n\nSlastyona managed to have spinner rotating for exactly *n* seconds. Being fascinated by elegance of the process, she completely forgot the direction the spinner was spun in! Lucky for her, she managed to recall the starting position, and wants to deduct the direction given the information she knows. Help her do this.\nInput specification: There are two characters in the first string\u00a0\u2013 the starting and the ending position of a spinner. The position is encoded with one of the following characters: v (ASCII code 118, lowercase v), &lt; (ASCII code 60), ^ (ASCII code 94) or &gt; (ASCII code 62) (see the picture above for reference). Characters are separated by a single space.\n\nIn the second strings, a single number *n* is given (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2013 the duration of the rotation.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the ending position of a spinner is a result of a *n* second spin in any of the directions, assuming the given starting position.. Output specification: Output cw, if the direction is clockwise, ccw\u00a0\u2013 if counter-clockwise, and undefined otherwise.\nDemo input: ['^ &gt;\\n1\\n', '&lt; ^\\n3\\n', '^ v\\n6\\n'], Demo output: ['cw\\n', 'ccw\\n', 'undefined\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: It's that time of the year when the Russians flood their countryside summer cottages (dachas) and the bus stop has a lot of people. People rarely go to the dacha on their own, it's usually a group, so the people stand in queue by groups.\n\nThe bus stop queue has *n* groups of people. The *i*-th group from the beginning has *a**i* people. Every 30 minutes an empty bus arrives at the bus stop, it can carry at most *m* people. Naturally, the people from the first group enter the bus first. Then go the people from the second group and so on. Note that the order of groups in the queue never changes. Moreover, if some group cannot fit all of its members into the current bus, it waits for the next bus together with other groups standing after it in the queue.\n\nYour task is to determine how many buses is needed to transport all *n* groups to the dacha countryside.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100).

Write a python script for the following problem: Kevin Sun has just finished competing in Codeforces Round #334! The round was 120 minutes long and featured five problems with maximum point values of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500, respectively. Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.\n\nCodeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is *x*, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute *m* but made *w* wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is . His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.\n\nAll arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains five space-separated integers *m*1, *m*2, *m*3, *m*4, *m*5, where *m**i* (0<=\u2264<=*m**i*<=\u2264<=119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem *i*. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted.\n\nThe second line contains five space-separated integers *w*1, *w*2, *w*3, *w*4, *w*5, where *w**i* (0<=\u2264<=*w**i*<=\u2264<=10) is Kevin's number of wrong submissions on problem *i*.\n\nThe last line contains two space-separated integers *h**s* and *h**u* (0<=\u2264<=*h**s*,<=*h**u*<=\u2264<=20), denoting the Kevin's numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively.. Output specification: Print a single integer, the value of Kevin's final score.\nDemo input: ['20 40 60 80 100\\n0 1 2 3 4\\n1 0\\n', '119 119 119 119 119\\n0 0 0 0 0\\n10 0\\n'], Demo output: ['4900\\n', '4930\\n']\nNote: In the second sample, Kevin takes 119 minutes on all of the problems. Therefore, he gets <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/42158dc2bc78cd21fa679530ae9ef8b9ea298d15.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> of the points on each problem. So his score from solving problems is <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/fdf392d8508500b57f8057ac0c4c892ab5f925a2.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>. Adding in 10\u00b7100\u2009=\u20091000 points from hacks, his total score becomes 3930\u2009+\u20091000\u2009=\u20094930."}]}}
