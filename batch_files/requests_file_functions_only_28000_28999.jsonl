Write a python script for the following problem: Reforms continue entering Berland. For example, during yesterday sitting the Berland Parliament approved as much as *n* laws (each law has been assigned a unique number from 1 to *n*). Today all these laws were put on the table of the President of Berland, G.W. Boosch, to be signed.\n\nThis time mr. Boosch plans to sign 2*k* laws. He decided to choose exactly two non-intersecting segments of integers from 1 to *n* of length *k* and sign all laws, whose numbers fall into these segments. More formally, mr. Boosch is going to choose two integers *a*, *b* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*k*<=+<=1,<=*b*<=-<=*a*<=\u2265<=*k*) and sign all laws with numbers lying in the segments [*a*;\u00a0*a*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] and [*b*;\u00a0*b*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] (borders are included).\n\nAs mr. Boosch chooses the laws to sign, he of course considers the public opinion. Allberland Public Opinion Study Centre (APOSC) conducted opinion polls among the citizens, processed the results into a report and gave it to the president. The report contains the absurdity value for each law, in the public opinion. As mr. Boosch is a real patriot, he is keen on signing the laws with the maximum total absurdity. Help him.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105, 0<=&lt;<=2*k*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of laws accepted by the parliament and the length of one segment in the law list, correspondingly. The next line contains *n* integers *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n* \u2014 the absurdity of each law (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=109).. Output specification: Print two integers *a*, *b* \u2014 the beginning of segments that mr. Boosch should choose. That means that the president signs laws with numbers from segments [*a*;\u00a0*a*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] and [*b*;\u00a0*b*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1]. If there are multiple solutions, print the one with the minimum number *a*. If there still are multiple solutions, print the one with the minimum *b*.\nDemo input: ['5 2\\n3 6 1 1 6\\n', '6 2\\n1 1 1 1 1 1\\n'], Demo output: ['1 4\\n', '1 3\\n']\nNote: In the first sample mr. Boosch signs laws with numbers from segments [1;2] and [4;5]. The total absurdity of the signed laws equals 3\u2009+\u20096\u2009+\u20091\u2009+\u20096\u2009=\u200916.\n\nIn the second sample mr.

This (possibly armed) conflict will determine the ultimate owner of the straight line.\n\nThe Two-dimensional kingdom has a regular army of *n* people. Each soldier registered himself and indicated the desired size of the bulletproof vest: the *i*-th soldier indicated size *a**i*.

Pair (*u**i*, *v**i*) means that soldier number *u**i* must wear vest number *v**i*. Soldiers and vests are numbered starting from one in the order in which they are specified in the input. All numbers of soldiers in the pairs should be pairwise different, all numbers of vests in the pairs also should be pairwise different. You can print the pairs in any order.\n\nIf there are multiple optimal answers, you are allowed to print any of them.\nDemo input: ['5 3 0 0\\n1 2 3 3 4\\n1 3 5\\n', '3 3 2 2\\n1 5 9\\n3 5 7\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n1 1\\n3 2\\n', '3\\n1 1\\n2 2\\n3 3\\n']\nNote: In the first sample you need the vests' sizes to match perfectly: the first soldier gets the first vest (size 1), the third soldier gets the second vest (size 3). This sample allows another answer, which gives the second vest to the fourth soldier instead of the third one.\n\nIn the second sample the vest size can differ from the desired size by at most 2 sizes, so all soldiers can be equipped."}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: You have a robot in a two-dimensional labyrinth which consists of *N*<=\u00d7<=*M* cells. Some pairs of cells adjacent by side are separated by a wall or a door. The labyrinth itself is separated from the outside with walls around it. Some labyrinth cells are the exits. In order to leave the labyrinth the robot should reach any exit. There are keys in some cells. Any key can open any door but after the door is opened the key stays in the lock. Thus every key can be used only once. There are no labyrinth cells that contain both a key and an exit. Also there can not be both a wall and a door between the pair of adjacent cells.\n\nYour need to write a program in *abc* language (see the language description below) that will lead the robot to one of the exits. Lets numerate the labyrinth rows from 0 to *N*<=-<=1 top to bottom and the columns \u2013 from 0 to *M*<=-<=1 left to right.\n\nIn *abc* language the following primary commands are available:\n -  move-DIR \u2013 move to the adjacent cell in the  direction. *down* increases the number of the row by 1, *right* increases the number of the column by 1. In case there\u2019s a wall or a closed door in this direction, nothing\u2019s happening. -  open-DIR \u2013 open the door between the current cell and the adjacent one in *DIR* direction. In case there isn\u2019t any door in this direction or it\u2019s already been opened or the robot doesn\u2019t have a key, nothing\u2019s happening.-  take \u2013 take the key in the current cell. In case there isn\u2019t any key or the robot has already picked it up, nothing\u2019s happening. The robot is able to carry any number of keys.-  terminate \u2013 terminate the program. This command is not obligatory to use. In case it\u2019s absent the command is added at the end of the program automatically. \nAlso, there are the following control commands in *abc* language: \n -  for-N OPS end \u2013 repeat the sequence of the *OPS* commands *N* times, 0<=&lt;<=*N*<=\u2264<=100000. Each loop counter check counts as a command fulfilled by the robot. -  if-ok  OPS1  else  OPS2  endif \u2013 carries out the sequence of the *OPS*1 commands, if the previous command of moving, taking the key or opening the door was successful, otherwise the sequence of the *OPS*2 commands is being carried out. Should there be no previous command run, the sequence *OPS*1 will be carried out. If-ok check counts as a command fulfilled by the robot. -  break \u2013 stops the current *for* loop. -  continue \u2013 finishes the current *for* loop iterations. \nNote that the control and the primary commands can be fit into each other arbitrarily.\n\nThe robot will fulfill your commands sequentially until it exits the labyrinth, or it runs out of the commands, or the *terminate* command is run, or the quantity of the fulfilled commands exceeds the bound number 5\u00b7106.\n\nIn *abc* language each command is a separate word and should be separated from other commands with at least one space symbol.\n\nYou should write a program that prints the sequence of commands leading the robot out of the labyrinth. Of course, as you are a good programmer, you should optimize these sequence.\n\nThe number of the non-space symbols in the sequence should not exceed 107. If you succeed in finding the way out of the labyrinth *i* you\u2019ll be granted the number of points equal to: \n -  *W**i* \u2013 labyrinth\u2019s weight, some fixed constant. -  *G**i* \u2013 number of robots moves. -  *O**i* \u2013 number of fulfilled commands. Note that this number includes commands like *take* executed in the cells with no key, as well as opening commands applied to the already opened doors. -  *L**i* \u2013 sequence length in symbols, excluding space symbols and line breaks. -  *Q*<==<=10\u00b7*N*\u00b7*M*. \nIn case your sequence doesn\u2019t lead the robot to the exit you\u2019ll be granted 0 points. Your programs result will be the sum of all *S**i*. You should maximize this total sum.\n\nAll labyrinths will be known and available to you.

Write a python script for the following problem: After the contest in comparing numbers, Shapur's teacher found out that he is a real genius and that no one could possibly do the calculations faster than him even using a super computer!\n\nSome days before the contest, the teacher took a very simple-looking exam and all his *n* students took part in the exam. The teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation.\n\nUnfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.\n\nNow the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers.\n\nShapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: \n -  As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. -  As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include \"-\", \";\" and \"_\". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. -  The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600 -  My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. -  Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN -  You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong. Do this by writing \"WA\" for Wrong answer or \"ACC\" for a correct answer. -  I should remind you that none of the strings (initial strings or answers) are empty. -  Finally, do these as soon as possible. You have less than 2 hours to complete this.\nInput specification: The first three lines contain a string each. These are the initial strings. They consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). All the initial strings have length from 1 to 100, inclusively.\n\nIn the fourth line there is a single integer *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000), the number of students.\n\nNext *n* lines contain a student's answer each.

Finding all powerful substrings (by substring Volodya means a subsequence of consecutive characters in a string) in a given text makes our hero especially joyful. Recently he felt an enormous fit of energy while reading a certain text. So Volodya decided to count all powerful substrings in this text and brag about it all day long.

The possible options for the game development are:\n -  Arrange the pebbles in 10 rows, one pebble per row. Then *c*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>\u2009=\u20091, and the game ends after the first move with the result of 11. -  Arrange the pebbles in 5 rows, two pebbles per row.

Write a python script for the following problem: Each year in the castle of Dwarven King there is a competition in growing mushrooms among the dwarves. The competition is one of the most prestigious ones, and the winner gets a wooden salad bowl. This year's event brought together the best mushroom growers from around the world, so we had to slightly change the rules so that the event gets more interesting to watch.\n\nEach mushroom grower has a mushroom that he will grow on the competition. Under the new rules, the competition consists of two parts. The first part lasts *t*1 seconds and the second part lasts *t*2 seconds. The first and the second part are separated by a little break.\n\nAfter the starting whistle the first part of the contest starts, and all mushroom growers start growing mushrooms at once, each at his individual speed of *v**i* meters per second. After *t*1 seconds, the mushroom growers stop growing mushrooms and go to have a break. During the break, for unexplained reasons, the growth of all mushrooms is reduced by *k* percent. After the break the second part of the contest starts and all mushrooms growers at the same time continue to grow mushrooms, each at his individual speed of *u**i* meters per second. After a *t*2 seconds after the end of the break, the competition ends. Note that the speeds before and after the break may vary.\n\nBefore the match dwarf Pasha learned from all participants, what two speeds they have chosen. However, the participants did not want to disclose to him all their strategy and therefore, did not say in what order they will be using these speeds. That is, if a participant chose speeds *a**i* and *b**i*, then there are two strategies: he either uses speed *a**i* before the break and speed *b**i* after it, or vice versa.\n\nDwarf Pasha really wants to win the totalizer. He knows that each participant chooses the strategy that maximizes the height of the mushroom. Help Dwarf Pasha make the final table of competition results.\n\nThe participants are sorted in the result table by the mushroom height (the participants with higher mushrooms follow earlier in the table). In case of equal mushroom heights, the participants are sorted by their numbers (the participants with a smaller number follow earlier).\nInput specification: The first input line contains four integer numbers *n*, *t*1, *t*2, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*t*1,<=*t*2<=\u2264<=1000;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of participants, the time before the break, the time after the break and the percentage, by which the mushroom growth drops during the break, correspondingly.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains two integers.

Write a python script for the following problem: Little Petya is learning to play chess. He has already learned how to move a king, a rook and a bishop. Let us remind you the rules of moving chess pieces. A chessboard is 64 square fields organized into an 8<=\u00d7<=8 table. A field is represented by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*) \u2014 the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:\n -  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically. -  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally. -  A king moves one field in any direction \u2014 horizontally, vertically or diagonally. \nPetya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2)? At that, we assume that there are no more pieces besides this one on the board.

Write a python script for the following problem: You're a mikemon breeder currently in the middle of your journey to become a mikemon master. Your current obstacle is go through the infamous Biridian Forest.\n\nThe forest\n\nThe Biridian Forest is a two-dimensional grid consisting of *r* rows and *c* columns. Each cell in Biridian Forest may contain a tree, or may be vacant. A vacant cell may be occupied by zero or more mikemon breeders (there may also be breeders other than you in the forest). Mikemon breeders (including you) cannot enter cells with trees. One of the cells is designated as the exit cell.\n\nThe initial grid, including your initial position, the exit cell, and the initial positions of all other breeders, will be given to you. Here's an example of such grid (from the first example):\n\nMoves\n\nBreeders (including you) may move in the forest. In a single move, breeders may perform one of the following actions: \n -  Do nothing. -  Move from the current cell to one of the four adjacent cells (two cells are adjacent if they share a side). Note that breeders cannot enter cells with trees. -  If you are located on the exit cell, you may leave the forest. Only you can perform this move \u2014 all other mikemon breeders will never leave the forest by using this type of movement. \nAfter each time you make a single move, each of the other breeders simultaneously make a single move (the choice of which move to make may be different for each of the breeders).\n\nMikemon battle\n\nIf you and *t* (*t*<=&gt;<=0) mikemon breeders are located on the same cell, exactly *t* mikemon battles will ensue that time (since you will be battling each of those *t* breeders once). After the battle, all of those *t* breeders will leave the forest to heal their respective mikemons.\n\nNote that the moment you leave the forest, no more mikemon battles can ensue, even if another mikemon breeder move to the exit cell immediately after that. Also note that a battle only happens between you and another breeders \u2014 there will be no battle between two other breeders (there may be multiple breeders coexisting in a single cell).\n\nYour goal\n\nYou would like to leave the forest. In order to do so, you have to make a sequence of moves, ending with a move of the final type. Before you make any move, however, you post this sequence on your personal virtual idol Blog. Then, you will follow this sequence of moves faithfully.\n\nGoal of other breeders\n\nBecause you post the sequence in your Blog, the other breeders will all know your exact sequence of moves even before you make your first move. All of them will move in such way that will guarantee a mikemon battle with you, if possible. The breeders that couldn't battle you will do nothing.\n\nYour task\n\nPrint the minimum number of mikemon battles that you must participate in, assuming that you pick the sequence of moves that minimize this number. Note that you are not required to minimize the number of moves you make.\nInput specification: The first line consists of two integers: *r* and *c* (1<=\u2264<=*r*,<=*c*<=\u2264<=1000), denoting the number of rows and the number of columns in Biridian Forest. The next *r* rows will each depict a row of the map, where each character represents the content of a single cell: \n -  'T': A cell occupied by a tree. -  'S': An empty cell, and your starting position. There will be exactly one occurence of this in the map. -  'E': An empty cell, and where the exit is located. There will be exactly one occurence of this in the map. -  A digit (0-9): A cell represented by a digit X means that the cell is empty and is occupied by X breeders (in particular, if X is zero, it means that the cell is not occupied by any breeder). \nIt is guaranteed that it will be possible for you to go from your starting position to the exit cell through a sequence of moves.. Output specification: A single line denoted the minimum possible number of mikemon battles that you have to participate in if you pick a strategy that minimize this number.\nDemo input: ['5 7\\n000E0T3\\nT0TT0T0\\n010T0T0\\n2T0T0T0\\n0T0S000\\n', '1 4\\nSE23\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: The following picture illustrates the first example. The blue line denotes a possible sequence of moves that you should post in your blog:\n\nThe three breeders on the left side of the map will be able to battle you \u2014 the lone breeder can simply stay in his place until you come while the other two breeders can move to where the lone breeder is and stay there until you come. The three breeders on the right does not have a way to battle you, so they will stay in their place.\n\nFor the second example, you should post this sequence in your Blog:\n\nHere's what happens. First, you move one cell to the right.\n\nThen, the two breeders directly to the right of the exit will simultaneously move to the left. The other three breeder cannot battle you so they will do nothing.\n\nYou end up in the same cell with 2 breeders, so 2 mikemon battles are conducted. After those battles, all of your opponents leave the forest.\n\nFinally, you make another move by leaving the forest."}]}}

These sections are connected by a chain: the 1-st section is adjacent only to the 2-nd one, the 2-nd one \u2014 to the 1-st and the 3-rd ones, the 3-rd one \u2014 only to the 2-nd one. The transitions are possible only between the adjacent sections.\n\nThe spacecraft team consists of *n* aliens. Each of them is given a rank \u2014 an integer from 1 to *n*. The ranks of all astronauts are distinct. The rules established on the Saucer, state that an alien may move from section *a* to section *b* only if it is senior in rank to all aliens who are in the segments *a* and *b* (besides, the segments *a* and *b* are of course required to be adjacent). Any alien requires exactly 1 minute to make a move. Besides, safety regulations require that no more than one alien moved at the same minute along the ship.\n\nAlien *A* is senior in rank to alien *B*, if the number indicating rank *A*, is more than the corresponding number for *B*.\n\nAt the moment the whole saucer team is in the 3-rd segment. They all need to move to the 1-st segment. One member of the crew, the alien with the identification number CFR-140, decided to calculate the minimum time (in minutes) they will need to perform this task.\n\nHelp CFR-140, figure out the minimum time (in minutes) that all the astronauts will need to move from the 3-rd segment to the 1-st one.

Write a python script for the following problem: Ahmed and Mostafa used to compete together in many programming contests for several years. Their coach Fegla asked them to solve one challenging problem, of course Ahmed was able to solve it but Mostafa couldn't.\n\nThis problem is similar to a standard problem but it has a different format and constraints.\n\nIn the standard problem you are given an array of integers, and you have to find one or more consecutive elements in this array where their sum is the maximum possible sum.\n\nBut in this problem you are given *n* small arrays, and you will create one big array from the concatenation of one or more instances of the small arrays (each small array could occur more than once). The big array will be given as an array of indexes (1-based) of the small arrays, and the concatenation should be done in the same order as in this array. Then you should apply the standard problem mentioned above on the resulting big array.\n\nFor example let's suppose that the small arrays are {1, 6, -2}, {3, 3} and {-5, 1}. And the indexes in the big array are {2, 3, 1, 3}. So the actual values in the big array after formatting it as concatenation of the small arrays will be {3, 3, -5, 1, 1, 6, -2, -5, 1}. In this example the maximum sum is 9.\n\nCan you help Mostafa solve this problem?\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m*, *n* is the number of the small arrays (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50), and *m* is the number of indexes in the big array (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=250000). Then follow *n* lines, the *i*-th line starts with one integer *l* which is the size of the *i*-th array (1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=5000), followed by *l* integers each one will be greater than or equal -1000 and less than or equal 1000. The last line contains *m* integers which are the indexes in the big array, and you should concatenate the small arrays in the same order, and each index will be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to *n*.\n\nThe small arrays are numbered from 1 to *n* in the same order as given in the input. Some of the given small arrays may not be used in big array.\n\nNote, that the array is very big. So if you try to build it straightforwardly, you will probably get time or/and memory limit exceeded.. Output specification: Print one line containing the maximum sum in the big array after formatting it as described above. You must choose at least one element for the sum, i. e. it cannot be empty.\n\nPlease, do not use %lld specificator to write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use cout (also you may use %I64d).\nDemo input: ['3 4\\n3 1 6 -2\\n2 3 3\\n2 -5 1\\n2 3 1 3\\n', '6 1\\n4 0 8 -3 -10\\n8 3 -2 -5 10 8 -9 -5 -4\\n1 0\\n1 -3\\n3 -8 5 6\\n2 9 6\\n1\\n'], Demo output: ['9\\n', '8\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

When Mishka solves the problem, it disappears from the list, so the length of the list decreases by $1$. Mishka stops when he is unable to solve any problem from any end of the list.\n\nHow many problems can Mishka solve?\nInput specification: The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n, k \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of problems in the contest and Mishka's problem-solving skill.\n\nThe second line of input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 100$), where $a_i$ is the difficulty of the $i$-th problem. The problems are given in order from the leftmost to the rightmost in the list.. Output specification: Print one integer \u2014 the maximum number of problems Mishka can solve.\nDemo input: ['8 4\\n4 2 3 1 5 1 6 4\\n', '5 2\\n3 1 2 1 3\\n', '5 100\\n12 34 55 43 21\\n'], Demo output: ['5\\n', '0\\n', '5\\n']\nNote: In the first example, Mishka can solve problems in the following order: $[4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 6, 4] \\rightarrow [2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 6, 4] \\rightarrow [2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 6] \\rightarrow [3, 1, 5, 1, 6] \\rightarrow [1, 5, 1, 6] \\rightarrow [5, 1, 6]$, so the number of solved problems will be equal to $5$.\n\nIn the second example, Mishka can't solve any problem because the difficulties of problems from both ends are greater than $k$.\n\nIn the third example, Mishka's solving skill is so amazing that he can solve all the problems."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$..

Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$."}]}}

{"custom_id": "28143", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/chat/completions", "body": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a Python programmer."}, {"role": "user", "content": "!only return the Python code in a Markdown block. Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: You have a robot in a two-dimensional labyrinth which consists of *N*<=\u00d7<=*M* cells. Some pairs of cells adjacent by side are separated by a wall or a door. The labyrinth itself is separated from the outside with walls around it. Some labyrinth cells are the exits. In order to leave the labyrinth the robot should reach any exit. There are keys in some cells. Any key can open any door but after the door is opened the key stays in the lock. Thus every key can be used only once. There are no labyrinth cells that contain both a key and an exit. Also there can not be both a wall and a door between the pair of adjacent cells.\n\nYour need to write a program in *abc* language (see the language description below) that will lead the robot to one of the exits. Lets numerate the labyrinth rows from 0 to *N*<=-<=1 top to bottom and the columns \u2013 from 0 to *M*<=-<=1 left to right.\n\nIn *abc* language the following primary commands are available:\n -  move-DIR \u2013 move to the adjacent cell in the  direction. *down* increases the number of the row by 1, *right* increases the number of the column by 1. In case there\u2019s a wall or a closed door in this direction, nothing\u2019s happening. -  open-DIR \u2013 open the door between the current cell and the adjacent one in *DIR* direction. In case there isn\u2019t any door in this direction or it\u2019s already been opened or the robot doesn\u2019t have a key, nothing\u2019s happening.-  take \u2013 take the key in the current cell. In case there isn\u2019t any key or the robot has already picked it up, nothing\u2019s happening. The robot is able to carry any number of keys.-  terminate \u2013 terminate the program. This command is not obligatory to use. In case it\u2019s absent the command is added at the end of the program automatically. \nAlso, there are the following control commands in *abc* language: \n -  for-N OPS end \u2013 repeat the sequence of the *OPS* commands *N* times, 0<=&lt;<=*N*<=\u2264<=100000. Each loop counter check counts as a command fulfilled by the robot. -  if-ok  OPS1  else  OPS2  endif \u2013 carries out the sequence of the *OPS*1 commands, if the previous command of moving, taking the key or opening the door was successful, otherwise the sequence of the *OPS*2 commands is being carried out. Should there be no previous command run, the sequence *OPS*1 will be carried out. If-ok check counts as a command fulfilled by the robot. -  break \u2013 stops the current *for* loop. -  continue \u2013 finishes the current *for* loop iterations. \nNote that the control and the primary commands can be fit into each other arbitrarily.\n\nThe robot will fulfill your commands sequentially until it exits the labyrinth, or it runs out of the commands, or the *terminate* command is run, or the quantity of the fulfilled commands exceeds the bound number 5\u00b7106.\n\nIn *abc* language each command is a separate word and should be separated from other commands with at least one space symbol.\n\nYou should write a program that prints the sequence of commands leading the robot out of the labyrinth. Of course, as you are a good programmer, you should optimize these sequence.\n\nThe number of the non-space symbols in the sequence should not exceed 107.

Write a python script for the following problem: By 2312 there were *n* Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*)..

Each project (keep in mind that it is determined by both its name and version) might depend on other projects. For sure, there are no cyclic dependencies.\n\nYou're given a list of project descriptions. The first of the given projects is the one being developed by Polycarp at this moment. Help Polycarp determine all projects that his project depends on (directly or via a certain chain). \n\nIt's possible that Polycarp's project depends on two different versions of some project. In this case collision resolving is applied, i.e. for each such project the system chooses the version that minimizes the distance from it to Polycarp's project. If there are several options, the newer (with the maximum version) is preferred. This version is considered actual; other versions and their dependencies are ignored.\n\nMore formal, choose such a set of projects of minimum possible size that the following conditions hold: \n -  Polycarp's project is chosen; -  Polycarp's project depends (directly or indirectly) on all other projects in the set; -  no two projects share the name; -  for each project *x* that some other project in the set depends on we have either *x* or some *y* with other version and shorter chain to Polycarp's project chosen.

Each person in the queue wants either to take several ice cream packs for himself and his friends or to give several ice cream packs to Kay and Gerda (carriers that bring ice cream have to stand in the same queue).\n\nIf a carrier with *d* ice cream packs comes to the house, then Kay and Gerda take all his packs. If a child who wants to take *d* ice cream packs comes to the house, then Kay and Gerda will give him *d* packs if they have enough ice cream, otherwise the child will get no ice cream at all and will leave in distress.\n\nKay wants to find the amount of ice cream they will have after all people will leave from the queue, and Gerda wants to find the number of distressed kids.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *x* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000, 0<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=109).\n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains a character '+' or '-', and an integer *d**i*, separated by a space (1<=\u2264<=*d**i*<=\u2264<=109). Record \"+ *d**i*\" in *i*-th line means that a carrier with *d**i* ice cream packs occupies *i*-th place from the start of the queue, and record \"- *d**i*\" means that a child who wants to take *d**i* packs stands in *i*-th place..

First, he asks you to tell him a positive integer *X*\u00a0\u2014 the required total volume of the tower. Then, Limak adds new blocks greedily, one by one. Each time he adds the biggest block such that the total volume doesn't exceed *X*.\n\nLimak asks you to choose *X* not greater than *m*.

Limak wants to maximize *X* secondarily so you should choose 42.\n\nIn more detail, after choosing *X*\u2009=\u200942 the process of building a tower is:\n -  Limak takes a block with side 3 because it's the biggest block with volume not greater than 42.

If there are several such vertices, we only know the value of the one with smallest id among those.\n\nHow many trees are there in the forest?\nInput specification: The first line contains single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=104)\u00a0\u2014 the number of Balls living in the forest.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n* of length *n*, where (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) holds and *p**i* denotes the most distant from Ball *i* relative living on the same tree. If there are several most distant relatives living on the same tree, *p**i* is the id of one with the smallest id.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the sequence *p* corresponds to some valid forest.\n\nHacking: To hack someone, you should provide a correct forest as a test. The sequence *p* will be calculated according to the forest and given to the solution you try to hack as input. Use the following format:\n\nIn the first line, output the integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=104)\u00a0\u2014 the number of Balls and the integer *m* (0<=\u2264<=*m*<=&lt;<=*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the total number of edges in the forest. Then *m* lines should follow. The *i*-th of them should contain two integers *a**i* and *b**i* and represent an edge between vertices in which relatives *a**i* and *b**i* live. For example, the first sample is written as follows:. Output specification: You should output the number of trees in the forest where PolandBall lives.\nDemo input: ['5\\n2 1 5 3 3', '1\\n1\\n'], Demo output: ['2', '1']\nNote: In the first sample testcase, possible forest is: 1-2 3-4-5. \n\nThere are 2 trees overall.\n\nIn the second sample testcase, the only possible graph is one vertex and no edges. Therefore, there is only one tree."}]}}

Filya has painted two rectangles, such that their sides are parallel to coordinate axes and each cell lies fully inside or fully outside each of them. Moreover, no cell lies in both rectangles.\n\nLater, hedgehog Filya became interested in the location of his rectangles but was unable to find the sheet of paper they were painted on. They were taken by Sonya and now she wants to play a little game with Filya. He tells her a query rectangle and she replies with the number of initial rectangles that lie fully inside the given query rectangle.

Recently, he has decided to take a couple of old songs and make dubstep remixes from them.\n\nLet's assume that a song consists of some number of words. To make the dubstep remix of this song, Vasya inserts a certain number of words \"WUB\" before the first word of the song (the number may be zero), after the last word (the number may be zero), and between words (at least one between any pair of neighbouring words), and then the boy glues together all the words, including \"WUB\", in one string and plays the song at the club.\n\nFor example, a song with words \"I AM X\" can transform into a dubstep remix as \"WUBWUBIWUBAMWUBWUBX\" and cannot transform into \"WUBWUBIAMWUBX\".\n\nRecently, Petya has heard Vasya's new dubstep track, but since he isn't into modern music, he decided to find out what was the initial song that Vasya remixed.

As Vlad wants to be sure the new game will work he wants to buy not one, but several video cards and unite their powers using the cutting-edge technology. To use this technology one of the cards is chosen as the leading one and other video cards are attached to it as secondary. For this new technology to work it's required that the power of each of the secondary video cards is divisible by the power of the leading video card. In order to achieve that the power of any secondary video card can be reduced to any integer value less or equal than the current power. However, the power of the leading video card should remain unchanged, i.e. it can't be reduced.\n\nVlad has an infinite amount of money so he can buy any set of video cards.

Write a python script for the following problem: Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment $0$ and turn power off at moment $M$. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array $a$, where $0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_{|a|} &lt; M$. All $a_i$ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$.. Output specification: Print the only integer \u2014 maximum possible total time when the lamp is lit.\nDemo input: ['3 10\\n4 6 7\\n', '2 12\\n1 10\\n', '2 7\\n3 4\\n'], Demo output: ['8\\n', '9\\n', '6\\n']\nNote: In the first example, one of possible optimal solutions is to insert value $x = 3$ before $a_1$, so program will be $[3, 4, 6, 7]$ and time of lamp being lit equals $(3 - 0) + (6 - 4) + (10 - 7) = 8$. Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$."}]}}

The transitions are possible only between the adjacent sections.\n\nThe spacecraft team consists of *n* aliens. Each of them is given a rank \u2014 an integer from 1 to *n*. The ranks of all astronauts are distinct. The rules established on the Saucer, state that an alien may move from section *a* to section *b* only if it is senior in rank to all aliens who are in the segments *a* and *b* (besides, the segments *a* and *b* are of course required to be adjacent). Any alien requires exactly 1 minute to make a move. Besides, safety regulations require that no more than one alien moved at the same minute along the ship.\n\nAlien *A* is senior in rank to alien *B*, if the number indicating rank *A*, is more than the corresponding number for *B*.\n\nAt the moment the whole saucer team is in the 3-rd segment.

Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective.

Write a python script for the following problem: One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes. The second line contains integers *x**c* and *y**c* \u2014 the initial square's coordinates (1<=\u2264<=*x**c*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y**c*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nThe third line contains an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the number of vectors.

So, he consecutively visits the squares (2,\u20092),\u2009(3,\u20093),\u2009(4,\u20094). Then he makes 0 steps by the second vector (1,\u20091). He makes 1 more step by the third vector (0,\u2009\u2009-\u20092) and he ends up in square (4,\u20092). Overall, Vasya makes 4 steps.\n\nIn the second sample Vasya is initially positioned in square (1,\u20092) and makes 0 steps by vector (\u2009-\u20091,\u20090), as the square with coordinates (0,\u20092) is located outside the yard."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: A famous Berland's painter Kalevitch likes to shock the public. One of his last obsessions is chess. For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards.\n\nAs before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8<=\u00d7<=8 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke.\n\nKalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client's requirements.\n\nIt goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything \u2014 for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's needs. You are asked to help Kalevitch with this task.\nInput specification: The input file contains 8 lines, each of the lines contains 8 characters.

There are three stations, on the first, there are initially 2 people, 3 people on the second, and 4 people on the third. Maximal capacities of the stations are 10, 9, and 8 respectively.\n\nOne of the winning strategies is to appoint two trains to the first and the third hours. Then on the first hour, the train takes all of the people from the stations, and at the end of the hour, 4 people arrive at the first station, 3 on the second, and 2 on the third.\n\nIn the second hour there are no trains appointed, and at the end of it, the same amount of people are arriving again.\n\nIn the third hour, the train first takes 8 people from the first station, and when it arrives at the second station, it takes only 2 people because it can accommodate no more than 10 people. Then it passes by the third station because it is already full. After it, people arrive at the stations once more, and the game ends.\n\nAs there was no such moment when the number of people at a station exceeded maximal capacity, we won using two trains."}]}}

They are developing an algorithm for two bots playing a two-player game. The game is cooperative and turn based. In each turn, one of the players makes a move (it doesn\u2019t matter which player, it's possible that players turns do not alternate). \n\nAlgorithm for bots that Sasha and Ira are developing works by keeping track of the state the game is in. Each time either bot makes a move, the state changes. And, since the game is very dynamic, it will never go back to the state it was already in at any point in the past.\n\nSasha and Ira are perfectionists and want their algorithm to have an optimal winning strategy. They have noticed that in the optimal winning strategy, both bots make exactly *N* moves each.

It can make moves when in state E, F and G, so states I, K and M are added to the list. Similarly, blue bot cannot make a move when in state G, but can when in D, E and F, so states H, J and L are added. -  Turn 4: Red bot already did N=2 moves when in states H, I and K, so it can only make moves when in J, L and M, so states P, R and S are added.

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Vasilisa the Wise from the Kingdom of Far Far Away got a magic box with a secret as a present from her friend Hellawisa the Wise from the Kingdom of A Little Closer. However, Vasilisa the Wise does not know what the box's secret is, since she cannot open it again. She hopes that you will help her one more time with that.\n\nThe box's lock looks as follows: it contains 4 identical deepenings for gems as a 2<=\u00d7<=2 square, and some integer numbers are written at the lock's edge near the deepenings. The example of a lock is given on the picture below.\n\nThe box is accompanied with 9 gems. Their shapes match the deepenings' shapes and each gem contains one number from 1 to 9 (each number is written on exactly one gem). The box will only open after it is decorated with gems correctly: that is, each deepening in the lock should be filled with exactly one gem. Also, the sums of numbers in the square's rows, columns and two diagonals of the square should match the numbers written at the lock's edge. For example, the above lock will open if we fill the deepenings with gems with numbers as is shown on the picture below.\n\nNow Vasilisa the Wise wants to define, given the numbers on the box's lock, which gems she should put in the deepenings to open the box. Help Vasilisa to solve this challenging task.\nInput specification: The input contains numbers written on the edges of the lock of the box. The first line contains space-separated integers *r*1 and *r*2 that define the required sums of numbers in the rows of the square. The second line contains space-separated integers *c*1 and *c*2 that define the required sums of numbers in the columns of the square. The third line contains space-separated integers *d*1 and *d*2 that define the required sums of numbers on the main and on the side diagonals of the square (1<=\u2264<=*r*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*1,<=*c*2,<=*d*1,<=*d*2<=\u2264<=20). Correspondence between the above 6 variables and places where they are written is shown on the picture below. For more clarifications please look at the second sample test that demonstrates the example given in the problem statement.. Output specification: Print the scheme of decorating the box with stones: two lines containing two space-separated integers from 1 to 9. The numbers should be pairwise different. If there is no solution for the given lock, then print the single number \"-1\" (without the quotes).\n\nIf there are several solutions, output any.\nDemo input: ['3 7\\n4 6\\n5 5\\n', '11 10\\n13 8\\n5 16\\n', '1 2\\n3 4\\n5 6\\n', '10 10\\n10 10\\n10 10\\n'], Demo output: ['1 2\\n3 4\\n', '4 7\\n9 1\\n', '-1\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: Pay attention to the last test from the statement: it is impossible to open the box because for that Vasilisa the Wise would need 4 identical gems containing number \"5\". However, Vasilisa only has one gem with each number from 1 to 9."}]}}

Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Let's dive into one of the most interesting areas of magic \u2014 writing spells. Learning this exciting but challenging science is very troublesome, so now you will not learn the magic words, but only get to know the basic rules of writing spells.\n\nEach spell consists of several lines. The line, whose first non-space character is character \"#\" is an amplifying line and it is responsible for spell power. The remaining lines are common, and determine the effect of the spell.\n\nYou came across the text of some spell. Spell was too long, so you cannot understand its meaning. So you want to make it as short as possible without changing the meaning.\n\nThe only way to shorten a spell that you know is the removal of some spaces and line breaks. We know that when it comes to texts of spells, the spaces carry meaning only in the amplifying lines, so we should remove all spaces in other lines. Newlines also do not matter, unless any of the two separated lines is amplifying. Thus, if two consecutive lines are not amplifying, they need to be joined into one (i.e. we should concatenate the second line to the first one). Removing spaces in amplifying lines and concatenating the amplifying lines to anything is forbidden.\n\nNote that empty lines must be processed just like all the others: they must be joined to the adjacent non-amplifying lines, or preserved in the output, if they are surrounded with amplifying lines on both sides (i.e. the line above it, if there is one, is amplifying, and the line below it, if there is one, is amplifying too).\n\nFor now those are the only instructions for removing unnecessary characters that you have to follow (oh yes, a newline is a character, too).\n\nThe input contains the text of the spell, which should be reduced. Remove the extra characters and print the result to the output.\nInput specification: The input contains multiple lines. All characters in the lines have codes from 32 to 127 (inclusive).

Natasha has an infinite number of banknotes of each denomination.\n\nMartians have $k$ fingers on their hands, so they use a number system with base $k$. In addition, the Martians consider the digit $d$ (in the number system with base $k$) divine. Thus, if the last digit in Natasha's tax amount written in the number system with the base $k$ is $d$, the Martians will be happy.

Street has $n$ positions to install lamps, they correspond to the integer numbers from $0$ to $n - 1$ on the OX axis. However, some positions are blocked and no post lamp can be placed there.\n\nThere are post lamps of different types which differ only by their power. When placed in position $x$, post lamp of power $l$ illuminates the segment $[x; x + l]$. The power of each post lamp is always a positive integer number.\n\nThe post lamp shop provides an infinite amount of lamps of each type from power $1$ to power $k$. Though each customer is only allowed to order post lamps of exactly one type. Post lamps of power $l$ cost $a_l$ each.\n\nWhat is the minimal total cost of the post lamps of exactly one type Adilbek can buy to illuminate the entire segment $[0; n]$ of the street? If some lamps illuminate any other segment of the street, Adilbek does not care, so, for example, he may place a lamp of power $3$ in position $n - 1$ (even though its illumination zone doesn't completely belong to segment $[0; n]$).\nInput specification: The first line contains three integer numbers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n \\le 10^6$, $0 \\le m \\le n$) \u2014 the length of the segment of the street Adilbek wants to illuminate, the number of the blocked positions and the maximum power of the post lamp available.\n\nThe second line contains $m$ integer numbers $s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_m$ ($0 \\le s_1 &lt; s_2 &lt; \\dots s_m &lt; n$) \u2014 the blocked positions.\n\nThe third line contains $k$ integer numbers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$) \u2014 the costs of the post lamps.. Output specification: Print the minimal total cost of the post lamps of exactly one type Adilbek can buy to illuminate the entire segment $[0; n]$ of the street.\n\nIf illumintaing the entire segment $[0; n]$ is impossible, print -1.\nDemo input: ['6 2 3\\n1 3\\n1 2 3\\n', '4 3 4\\n1 2 3\\n1 10 100 1000\\n', '5 1 5\\n0\\n3 3 3 3 3\\n', '7 4 3\\n2 4 5 6\\n3 14 15\\n'], Demo output: ['6\\n', '1000\\n', '-1\\n', '-1\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Fortunately for Karlsson, there wasn't anybody in his friend's house. Karlsson was not going to be hungry any longer, so he decided to get some food in the house.\n\nKarlsson's gaze immediately fell on *n* wooden cupboards, standing in the kitchen. He immediately realized that these cupboards have hidden jam stocks. Karlsson began to fly greedily around the kitchen, opening and closing the cupboards' doors, grab and empty all the jars of jam that he could find.\n\nAnd now all jars of jam are empty, Karlsson has had enough and does not want to leave traces of his stay, so as not to let down his friend. Each of the cupboards has two doors: the left one and the right one. Karlsson remembers that when he rushed to the kitchen, all the cupboards' left doors were in the same position (open or closed), similarly, all the cupboards' right doors were in the same position (open or closed). Karlsson wants the doors to meet this condition as well by the time the family returns. Karlsson does not remember the position of all the left doors, also, he cannot remember the position of all the right doors. Therefore, it does not matter to him in what position will be all left or right doors. It is important to leave all the left doors in the same position, and all the right doors in the same position. For example, all the left doors may be closed, and all the right ones may be open.\n\nKarlsson needs one second to open or close a door of a cupboard.

The Little Elephant and his friend know that a proper chessboard doesn't have any side-adjacent cells with the same color and the upper left cell is white. To play chess, they want to make the board they have a proper chessboard. For that the friends can choose any row of the board and cyclically shift the cells of the chosen row, that is, put the last (rightmost) square on the first place in the row and shift the others one position to the right. You can run the described operation multiple times (or not run it at all).\n\nFor example, if the first line of the board looks like that \"BBBBBBWW\" (the white cells of the line are marked with character \"W\", the black cells are marked with character \"B\"), then after one cyclic shift it will look like that \"WBBBBBBW\".\n\nHelp the Little Elephant and his friend to find out whether they can use any number of the described operations to turn the board they have into a proper chessboard.\nInput specification: The input consists of exactly eight lines.

As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest.

Oleg calls a non-empty sequence of days a zebra, if it starts with a bad day, ends with a bad day, and good and bad days are alternating in it. Let us denote bad days as 0 and good days as 1. Then, for example, sequences of days 0, 010, 01010 are zebras, while sequences 1, 0110, 0101 are not.\n\nOleg tells you the story of days he lived in chronological order in form of string consisting of 0 and 1. Now you are interested if it is possible to divide Oleg's life history into several subsequences, each of which is a zebra, and the way it can be done. Each day must belong to exactly one of the subsequences. For each of the subsequences, days forming it must be ordered chronologically. Note that subsequence does not have to be a group of consecutive days.\nInput specification: In the only line of input data there is a non-empty string *s* consisting of characters 0 and 1, which describes the history of Oleg's life. Its length (denoted as |*s*|) does not exceed 200<=000 characters.. Output specification: If there is a way to divide history into zebra subsequences, in the first line of output you should print an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=|*s*|), the resulting number of subsequences. In the *i*-th of following *k* lines first print the integer *l**i* (1<=\u2264<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=|*s*|), which is the length of the *i*-th subsequence, and then *l**i* indices of days forming the subsequence. Indices must follow in ascending order. Days are numbered starting from 1. Each index from 1 to *n* must belong to exactly one subsequence. If there is no way to divide day history into zebra subsequences, print -1.\n\nSubsequences may be printed in any order. If there are several solutions, you may print any of them.

And, as the boy loves hockey very much, even more than physics, he forgot to do the homework. Specifically, he forgot to complete his physics tasks. Next day the teacher got very angry at Vasya and decided to teach him a lesson. He gave the lazy student a seemingly easy task: You are given an idle body in space and the forces that affect it. The body can be considered as a material point with coordinates (0; 0; 0). Vasya had only to answer whether it is in equilibrium. \"Piece of cake\" \u2014 thought Vasya, we need only to check if the sum of all vectors is equal to 0. So, Vasya began to solve the problem.

At a specific point in time, a spinner can take 4 positions shown below (each one rotated 90 degrees relative to the previous, with the fourth one followed by the first one):\n\nAfter the spinner was spun, it starts its rotation, which is described by a following algorithm: the spinner maintains its position for a second then majestically switches to the next position in clockwise or counter-clockwise order, depending on the direction the spinner was spun in.\n\nSlastyona managed to have spinner rotating for exactly *n* seconds. Being fascinated by elegance of the process, she completely forgot the direction the spinner was spun in! Lucky for her, she managed to recall the starting position, and wants to deduct the direction given the information she knows. Help her do this.\nInput specification: There are two characters in the first string\u00a0\u2013 the starting and the ending position of a spinner. The position is encoded with one of the following characters: v (ASCII code 118, lowercase v), &lt; (ASCII code 60), ^ (ASCII code 94) or &gt; (ASCII code 62) (see the picture above for reference). Characters are separated by a single space.\n\nIn the second strings, a single number *n* is given (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2013 the duration of the rotation.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the ending position of a spinner is a result of a *n* second spin in any of the directions, assuming the given starting position.. Output specification: Output cw, if the direction is clockwise, ccw\u00a0\u2013 if counter-clockwise, and undefined otherwise.\nDemo input: ['^ &gt;\\n1\\n', '&lt; ^\\n3\\n', '^ v\\n6\\n'], Demo output: ['cw\\n', 'ccw\\n', 'undefined\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: BigData Inc. is a corporation that has *n* data centers indexed from 1 to *n* that are located all over the world. These data centers provide storage for client data (you can figure out that client data is really big!).\n\nMain feature of services offered by BigData Inc. is the access availability guarantee even under the circumstances of any data center having an outage. Such a guarantee is ensured by using the two-way replication. Two-way replication is such an approach for data storage that any piece of data is represented by two identical copies that are stored in two different data centers.\n\nFor each of *m* company clients, let us denote indices of two different data centers storing this client data as *c**i*,<=1 and *c**i*,<=2.\n\nIn order to keep data centers operational and safe, the software running on data center computers is being updated regularly. Release cycle of BigData Inc. is one day meaning that the new version of software is being deployed to the data center computers each day.\n\nData center software update is a non-trivial long process, that is why there is a special hour-long time frame that is dedicated for data center maintenance. During the maintenance period, data center computers are installing software updates, and thus they may be unavailable. Consider the day to be exactly *h* hours long. For each data center there is an integer *u**j* (0<=\u2264<=*u**j*<=\u2264<=*h*<=-<=1) defining the index of an hour of day, such that during this hour data center *j* is unavailable due to maintenance.\n\nSumming up everything above, the condition *u**c**i*,<=1<=\u2260<=*u**c**i*,<=2 should hold for each client, or otherwise his data may be unaccessible while data centers that store it are under maintenance.\n\nDue to occasional timezone change in different cities all over the world, the maintenance time in some of the data centers may change by one hour sometimes. Company should be prepared for such situation, that is why they decided to conduct an experiment, choosing some non-empty subset of data centers, and shifting the maintenance time for them by an hour later (i.e. if *u**j*<==<=*h*<=-<=1, then the new maintenance hour would become 0, otherwise it would become *u**j*<=+<=1). Nonetheless, such an experiment should not break the accessibility guarantees, meaning that data of any client should be still available during any hour of a day after the data center maintenance times are changed.\n\nSuch an experiment would provide useful insights, but changing update time is quite an expensive procedure, that is why the company asked you to find out the minimum number of data centers that have to be included in an experiment in order to keep the data accessibility guarantees.\nInput specification: The first line of input contains three integers *n*, *m* and *h* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100<=000, 2<=\u2264<=*h*<=\u2264<=100<=000), the number of company data centers, number of clients and the day length of day measured in hours. \n\nThe second line of input contains *n* integers *u*1,<=*u*2,<=...,<=*u**n* (0<=\u2264<=*u**j*<=&lt;<=*h*), *j*-th of these numbers is an index of a maintenance hour for data center *j*. \n\nEach of the next *m* lines contains two integers *c**i*,<=1 and *c**i*,<=2 (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*,<=1,<=*c**i*,<=2<=\u2264<=*n*, *c**i*,<=1<=\u2260<=*c**i*,<=2), defining the data center indices containing the data of client *i*.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given maintenance schedule allows each client to access at least one copy of his data at any moment of day.. Output specification: In the first line print the minimum possible number of data centers *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*) that have to be included in an experiment in order to keep the data available for any client.\n\nIn the second line print *k* distinct integers *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**k* (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=*n*), the indices of data centers whose maintenance time will be shifted by one hour later. Data center indices may be printed in any order.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, it is allowed to print any of them. It is guaranteed that at there is at least one valid choice of data centers.\nDemo input: ['3 3 5\\n4 4 0\\n1 3\\n3 2\\n3 1\\n', '4 5 4\\n2 1 0 3\\n4 3\\n3 2\\n1 2\\n1 4\\n1 3\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n3 ', '4\\n1 2 3 4 ']\nNote: Consider the first sample test. The given answer is the only way to conduct an experiment involving the only data center. In such a scenario the third data center has a maintenance during the hour 1, and no two data centers storing the information of the same client have maintenance at the same hour.\n\nOn the other hand, for example, if we shift the maintenance time on hour later for the first data center, then the data of clients 1 and 3 will be unavailable during the hour 0."}]}}

Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*)..

Output specification: Print three positive space-separated integers *a*, *b*, *c*\u00a0\u2014 three distinct numbers (*a*,<=*b*,<=*c*) that form the counterexample. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them. The numbers must be printed in ascending order. \n\nIf the counterexample does not exist, print the single number -1.\nDemo input: ['2 4\\n', '10 11\\n', '900000000000000009 900000000000000029\\n'], Demo output: ['2 3 4\\n', '-1\\n', '900000000000000009 900000000000000010 900000000000000021\\n']\nNote: In the first sample pair (2,\u20094) is not coprime and pairs (2,\u20093) and (3,\u20094) are. \n\nIn the second sample you cannot form a group of three distinct integers, so the answer is -1. \n\nIn the third sample it is easy to see that numbers 900000000000000009 and 900000000000000021 are divisible by three."}]}}

Today all these laws were put on the table of the President of Berland, G.W. Boosch, to be signed.\n\nThis time mr. Boosch plans to sign 2*k* laws. He decided to choose exactly two non-intersecting segments of integers from 1 to *n* of length *k* and sign all laws, whose numbers fall into these segments. More formally, mr.

All these strings are considered to be suffixes of the word (this time we use word \"suffix\" to describe a morpheme but not the few last characters of the string as you may used to). \n\nHere is one exercise that you have found in your task list. You are given the word *s*. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language. \n\nTwo strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match. \n\nLet's look at the example: the word *abacabaca* is given. This word can be obtained in the following ways: , where the root of the word is overlined, and suffixes are marked by \"corners\". Thus, the set of possible suffixes for this word is {*aca*,<=*ba*,<=*ca*}.\nInput specification: The only line contains a string *s* (5<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=104) consisting of lowercase English letters.. Output specification: On the first line print integer *k* \u2014 a number of distinct possible suffixes. On the next *k* lines print suffixes. \n\nPrint suffixes in lexicographical (alphabetical) order.\nDemo input: ['abacabaca\\n', 'abaca\\n'], Demo output: ['3\\naca\\nba\\nca\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: The first test was analysed in the problem statement. \n\nIn the second example the length of the string equals 5. The length of the root equals 5, so no string can be used as a suffix."}]}}

He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.

Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy.

Write a python script for the following problem: Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.\n\nAccording to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.\n\nVasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to *n*) and ending with the *n*-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the *n*-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTo finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to *n*, and generated *m* queries of the form: find element with value *b**i* in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand.\n\nBut the problem is, linear search is too slow. That's why the boys aren't going to find out who is right before the end of the training, unless you come in here.

Write a python script for the following problem: This is an interactive problem. In the output section below you will see the information about flushing the output.\n\nBear Limak thinks of some hidden number\u00a0\u2014 an integer from interval [2,<=100]. Your task is to say if the hidden number is prime or composite.\n\nInteger *x*<=&gt;<=1 is called prime if it has exactly two distinct divisors, 1 and *x*. If integer *x*<=&gt;<=1 is not prime, it's called composite.\n\nYou can ask up to 20 queries about divisors of the hidden number. In each query you should print an integer from interval [2,<=100]. The system will answer \"yes\" if your integer is a divisor of the hidden number. Otherwise, the answer will be \"no\".\n\nFor example, if the hidden number is 14 then the system will answer \"yes\" only if you print 2, 7 or 14.\n\nWhen you are done asking queries, print \"prime\" or \"composite\" and terminate your program.\n\nYou will get the Wrong Answer verdict if you ask more than 20 queries, or if you print an integer not from the range [2,<=100]. Also, you will get the Wrong Answer verdict if the printed answer isn't correct.\n\nYou will get the Idleness Limit Exceeded verdict if you don't print anything (but you should) or if you forget about flushing the output (more info below).\nInput specification: After each query you should read one string from the input. It will be \"yes\" if the printed integer is a divisor of the hidden number, and \"no\" otherwise.. Output specification: Up to 20 times you can ask a query\u00a0\u2014 print an integer from interval [2,<=100] in one line. You have to both print the end-of-line character and flush the output. After flushing you should read a response from the input.\n\nIn any moment you can print the answer \"prime\" or \"composite\" (without the quotes). After that, flush the output and terminate your program.\n\nTo flush you can use (just after printing an integer and end-of-line): \n -  fflush(stdout) in C++; -  System.out.flush() in Java; -  stdout.flush() in Python; -  flush(output) in Pascal; -  See the documentation for other languages. \nHacking. To hack someone, as the input you should print the hidden number\u00a0\u2014 one integer from the interval [2,<=100]. Of course, his/her solution won't be able to read the hidden number from the input.\nDemo input: ['yes\\nno\\nyes\\n', 'no\\nyes\\nno\\nno\\nno\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n80\\n5\\ncomposite\\n', '58\\n59\\n78\\n78\\n2\\nprime\\n']\nNote: The hidden number in the first query is 30.

Thus, it must be composite. Note that it isn't necessary to know the exact value of the hidden number. In this test, the hidden number is 30.\n\n<img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/35c6952617fa94ec3e0ea8e63aa1c3c49b3ba420.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\n59 is a divisor of the hidden number. In the interval [2,\u2009100] there is only one number with this divisor. The hidden number must be 59, which is prime. Note that the answer is known even after the second query and you could print it then and terminate. Though, it isn't forbidden to ask unnecessary queries (unless you exceed the limit of 20 queries)."}]}}

How about a statement like that: \"each integer no less than 12 can be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers.\" Not like the Goldbach's conjecture, I can prove this theorem.\n\nYou are given an integer *n* no less than 12, express it as a sum of two composite numbers.\nInput specification: The only line contains an integer *n* (12<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=106)..

Find out how the deminations of the coins differ or if Vasya has a mistake in the weighting results. No two coins are equal.\nInput specification: The input data contains the results of all the weighting, one result on each line. It is guaranteed that every coin pair was weighted exactly once. Vasya labelled the coins with letters \u00abA\u00bb, \u00abB\u00bb and \u00abC\u00bb. Each result is a line that appears as (letter)(&gt; or &lt; sign)(letter). For example, if coin \"A\" proved lighter than coin \"B\", the result of the weighting is A&lt;B.. Output specification: It the results are contradictory, print Impossible. Otherwise, print without spaces the rearrangement of letters \u00abA\u00bb, \u00abB\u00bb and \u00abC\u00bb which represent the coins in the increasing order of their weights.\nDemo input: ['A&gt;B\\nC&lt;B\\nA&gt;C\\n', 'A&lt;B\\nB&gt;C\\nC&gt;A\\n'], Demo output: ['CBA', 'ACB']\nNote: none"}]}}

Thus, you can go to room *x* only from room *x*<=-<=1.\n\nThe potato pie is located in the *n*-th room and Vitaly needs to go there. \n\nEach pair of consecutive rooms has a door between them. In order to go to room *x* from room *x*<=-<=1, you need to open the door between the rooms with the corresponding key. \n\nIn total the house has several types of doors (represented by uppercase Latin letters) and several types of keys (represented by lowercase Latin letters). The key of type *t* can open the door of type *T* if and only if *t* and *T* are the same letter, written in different cases. For example, key f can open door F.\n\nEach of the first *n*<=-<=1 rooms contains exactly one key of some type that Vitaly can use to get to next rooms.

He explains any strange and weird phenomenon through intervention of supernatural forces. But who would have thought that even in a regular array of numbers Valera manages to see something beautiful and magical.\n\nValera absolutely accidentally got a piece of ancient parchment on which an array of numbers was written.

Despite the tremendous intelligence and wit, Valera counts very badly and so you will have to complete his work.

Write a python script for the following problem: It's a beautiful April day and Wallace is playing football with his friends. But his friends do not know that Wallace actually stayed home with Gromit and sent them his robotic self instead. Robo-Wallace has several advantages over the other guys. For example, he can hit the ball directly to the specified point. And yet, the notion of a giveaway is foreign to him. The combination of these features makes the Robo-Wallace the perfect footballer \u2014 as soon as the ball gets to him, he can just aim and hit the goal. He followed this tactics in the first half of the match, but he hit the goal rarely. The opposing team has a very good goalkeeper who catches most of the balls that fly directly into the goal. But Robo-Wallace is a quick thinker, he realized that he can cheat the goalkeeper. After all, they are playing in a football box with solid walls. Robo-Wallace can kick the ball to the other side, then the goalkeeper will not try to catch the ball. Then, if the ball bounces off the wall and flies into the goal, the goal will at last be scored.\n\nYour task is to help Robo-Wallace to detect a spot on the wall of the football box, to which the robot should kick the ball, so that the ball bounces once and only once off this wall and goes straight to the goal. In the first half of the match Robo-Wallace got a ball in the head and was severely hit. As a result, some of the schemes have been damaged. Because of the damage, Robo-Wallace can only aim to his right wall (Robo-Wallace is standing with his face to the opposing team's goal).\n\nThe football box is rectangular. Let's introduce a two-dimensional coordinate system so that point (0, 0) lies in the lower left corner of the field, if you look at the box above. Robo-Wallace is playing for the team, whose goal is to the right. It is an improvised football field, so the gate of Robo-Wallace's rivals may be not in the middle of the left wall.\n\nIn the given coordinate system you are given: \n -  *y*1, *y*2 \u2014 the *y*-coordinates of the side pillars of the goalposts of robo-Wallace's opponents; -  *y**w* \u2014 the *y*-coordinate of the wall to which Robo-Wallace is aiming; -  *x**b*, *y**b* \u2014 the coordinates of the ball's position when it is hit; -  *r* \u2014 the radius of the ball. \nA goal is scored when the center of the ball crosses the *OY* axis in the given coordinate system between (0, *y*1) and (0, *y*2). The ball moves along a straight line. The ball's hit on the wall is perfectly elastic (the ball does not shrink from the hit), the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. If the ball bounces off the wall not to the goal, that is, if it hits the other wall or the goal post, then the opposing team catches the ball and Robo-Wallace starts looking for miscalculation and gets dysfunctional. Such an outcome, if possible, should be avoided. We assume that the ball touches an object, if the distance from the center of the ball to the object is no greater than the ball radius *r*.\nInput specification: The first and the single line contains integers *y*1, *y*2, *y**w*, *x**b*, *y**b*, *r* (1<=\u2264<=*y*1,<=*y*2,<=*y**w*,<=*x**b*,<=*y**b*<=\u2264<=106; *y*1<=&lt;<=*y*2<=&lt;<=*y**w*; *y**b*<=+<=*r*<=&lt;<=*y**w*; 2\u00b7*r*<=&lt;<=*y*2<=-<=*y*1).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at. The goal posts can't be located in the field corners.. Output specification: If Robo-Wallace can't score a goal in the described manner, print \"-1\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print a single number *x**w* \u2014 the abscissa of his point of aiming. \n\nIf there are multiple points of aiming, print the abscissa of any of them.

Thus the answer is 2<sup class=\"upper-index\">3</sup>\u2009=\u20098.\n\nIn the second example, the upper two structures in the figure below are instances of valid ones, while the lower two are invalid due to the blue and purple clusters, respectively."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: *T* is a complete binary tree consisting of *n* vertices. It means that exactly one vertex is a root, and each vertex is either a leaf (and doesn't have children) or an inner node (and has exactly two children). All leaves of a complete binary tree have the same depth (distance from the root). So *n* is a number such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nIn the picture you can see a complete binary tree with *n*<==<=15.\n\nVertices are numbered from 1 to *n* in a special recursive way: we recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the left subtree (if current vertex is not a leaf), then assign a number to the current vertex, and then recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the right subtree (if it exists). In the picture vertices are numbered exactly using this algorithm. It is clear that for each size of a complete binary tree exists exactly one way to give numbers to all vertices. This way of numbering is called symmetric.\n\nYou have to write a program that for given *n* answers *q* queries to the tree.\n\nEach query consists of an integer number *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) and a string *s**i*, where *u**i* is the number of vertex, and *s**i* represents the path starting from this vertex. String *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U', which mean traverse to the left child, to the right child and to the parent, respectively. Characters from *s**i* have to be processed from left to right, considering that *u**i* is the vertex where the path starts. If it's impossible to process a character (for example, to go to the left child of a leaf), then you have to skip it. The answer is the number of vertex where the path represented by *s**i* ends.\n\nFor example, if *u**i*<==<=4 and *s**i*<==<=\u00abUURL\u00bb, then the answer is 10.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integer numbers *n* and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1018, *q*<=\u2265<=1). *n* is such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nThe next 2*q* lines represent queries; each query consists of two consecutive lines. The first of these two lines contains *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*), the second contains non-empty string *s**i*. *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of *s**i* (for each *i* such that 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*q*) doesn't exceed 105..

Write a python script for the following problem: Reforms continue entering Berland. For example, during yesterday sitting the Berland Parliament approved as much as *n* laws (each law has been assigned a unique number from 1 to *n*). Today all these laws were put on the table of the President of Berland, G.W. Boosch, to be signed.\n\nThis time mr. Boosch plans to sign 2*k* laws. He decided to choose exactly two non-intersecting segments of integers from 1 to *n* of length *k* and sign all laws, whose numbers fall into these segments. More formally, mr. Boosch is going to choose two integers *a*, *b* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*k*<=+<=1,<=*b*<=-<=*a*<=\u2265<=*k*) and sign all laws with numbers lying in the segments [*a*;\u00a0*a*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] and [*b*;\u00a0*b*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] (borders are included).\n\nAs mr. Boosch chooses the laws to sign, he of course considers the public opinion. Allberland Public Opinion Study Centre (APOSC) conducted opinion polls among the citizens, processed the results into a report and gave it to the president. The report contains the absurdity value for each law, in the public opinion. As mr. Boosch is a real patriot, he is keen on signing the laws with the maximum total absurdity. Help him.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105, 0<=&lt;<=2*k*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of laws accepted by the parliament and the length of one segment in the law list, correspondingly. The next line contains *n* integers *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n* \u2014 the absurdity of each law (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=109).. Output specification: Print two integers *a*, *b* \u2014 the beginning of segments that mr. Boosch should choose. That means that the president signs laws with numbers from segments [*a*;\u00a0*a*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1] and [*b*;\u00a0*b*<=+<=*k*<=-<=1].

An here's our new task: \n\nAn expression of counting sticks is an expression of type:\n\nSign + consists of two crossed sticks: one vertical and one horizontal. Sign = consists of two horizontal sticks. The expression is arithmetically correct if *A*<=+<=*B*<==<=*C*.\n\nWe've got an expression that looks like *A*<=+<=*B*<==<=*C* given by counting sticks. Our task is to shift at most one stick (or we can shift nothing) so that the expression became arithmetically correct.

Each stairs or elevator occupies all sections $(1, x)$, $(2, x)$, $\\ldots$, $(n, x)$ for some $x$ between $1$ and $m$. All sections not occupied with stairs or elevators contain guest rooms.

Later that day Malek was thinking about the broken stick and suddenly he came up with the following problem.\n\nSuppose the digital counter is showing number *n*. Malek calls an integer *x* (0<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=99) good if it's possible that the digital counter was supposed to show *x* but because of some(possibly none) broken sticks it's showing *n* instead. Malek wants to know number of good integers for a specific *n*. So you must write a program that calculates this number. Please note that the counter always shows two digits.\nInput specification: The only line of input contains exactly two digits representing number *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=99). Note that *n* may have a leading zero.. Output specification: In the only line of the output print the number of good integers.\nDemo input: ['89\\n', '00\\n', '73\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '4\\n', '15\\n']\nNote: In the first sample the counter may be supposed to show 88 or 89.\n\nIn the second sample the good integers are 00, 08, 80 and 88.\n\nIn the third sample the good integers are 03,\u200908,\u200909,\u200933,\u200938,\u200939,\u200973,\u200978,\u200979,\u200983,\u200988,\u200989,\u200993,\u200998,\u200999."}]}}

The round was 120 minutes long and featured five problems with maximum point values of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500, respectively. Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.\n\nCodeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is *x*, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute *m* but made *w* wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is . His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.\n\nAll arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains five space-separated integers *m*1, *m*2, *m*3, *m*4, *m*5, where *m**i* (0<=\u2264<=*m**i*<=\u2264<=119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem *i*.

This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.\n\nShop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following *n* days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in *i*-th day *k**i* products will be put up for sale and exactly *l**i* clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any *f* days from *n* next for sell-outs. On each of *f* chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on *i*-th day shop planned to put up for sale *k**i* products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7*k**i* products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.\n\nNoora's task is to choose *f* days to maximize total number of sold products.

Furthermore it is not possible for the tram to have a capacity less than 6. Hence, 6 is the correct answer."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Inna and Dima bought a table of size *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* in the shop. Each cell of the table contains a single letter: \"D\", \"I\", \"M\", \"A\".\n\nInna loves Dima, so she wants to go through his name as many times as possible as she moves through the table. For that, Inna acts as follows:\n 1.  initially, Inna chooses some cell of the table where letter \"D\" is written; 1.  then Inna can move to some side-adjacent table cell that contains letter \"I\"; then from this cell she can go to one of the side-adjacent table cells that contains the written letter \"M\"; then she can go to a side-adjacent cell that contains letter \"A\". Then Inna assumes that she has gone through her sweetheart's name; 1.  Inna's next move can be going to one of the side-adjacent table cells that contains letter \"D\" and then walk on through name DIMA in the similar manner. Inna never skips a letter. So, from the letter \"D\" she always goes to the letter \"I\", from the letter \"I\" she always goes the to letter \"M\", from the letter \"M\" she always goes to the letter \"A\", and from the letter \"A\" she always goes to the letter \"D\". \nDepending on the choice of the initial table cell, Inna can go through name DIMA either an infinite number of times or some positive finite number of times or she can't go through his name once. Help Inna find out what maximum number of times she can go through name DIMA.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=103). \n\nThen follow *n* lines that describe Inna and Dima's table. Each line contains *m* characters. Each character is one of the following four characters: \"D\", \"I\", \"M\", \"A\". \n\nNote that it is not guaranteed that the table contains at least one letter \"D\".. Output specification: If Inna cannot go through name DIMA once, print on a single line \"Poor Dima!\" without the quotes. If there is the infinite number of names DIMA Inna can go through, print \"Poor Inna!\" without the quotes. Otherwise print a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of times Inna can go through name DIMA.\nDemo input: ['1 2\\nDI\\n', '2 2\\nMA\\nID\\n', '5 5\\nDIMAD\\nDIMAI\\nDIMAM\\nDDMAA\\nAAMID\\n'], Demo output: ['Poor Dima!\\n', 'Poor Inna!\\n', '4\\n']\nNote: Notes to the samples:\n\nIn the first test sample, Inna cannot go through name DIMA a single time.\n\nIn the second test sample, Inna can go through the infinite number of words DIMA. For that, she should move in the clockwise direction starting from the lower right corner.\n\nIn the third test sample the best strategy is to start from the cell in the upper left corner of the table. Starting from this cell, Inna can go through name DIMA four times."}]}}

For the $i$-th exam Petya should prepare in days between $s_i$ and $d_i-1$, inclusive. \nThere are three types of activities for Petya in each day: to spend a day doing nothing (taking a rest), to spend a day passing exactly one exam or to spend a day preparing for exactly one exam. So he can't pass/prepare for multiple exams in a day. He can't mix his activities in a day. If he is preparing for the $i$-th exam in day $j$, then $s_i \\le j &lt; d_i$.\n\nIt is allowed to have breaks in a preparation to an exam and to alternate preparations for different exams in consecutive days.

Besides, the keys are of two types. Some of the keys have lowercase Latin letters on them and some of the keys work like the \"Shift\" key on standard keyboards, that is, they make lowercase letters uppercase.\n\nVasya can press one or two keys with one hand. However, he can only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the keys does not exceed *x*. The keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.\n\nVasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest \"Shift\" key is strictly larger than *x*. In this case he will have to use his other hand. Having typed the symbol, Vasya returns other hand back to the chips.\n\nYou are given Vasya's keyboard and the text.

The semiknight can move in any of these four directions: 2 squares forward and 2 squares to the right, 2 squares forward and 2 squares to the left, 2 squares backward and 2 to the right and 2 squares backward and 2 to the left. Naturally, the semiknight cannot move beyond the limits of the chessboard.\n\nPetya put two semiknights on a standard chessboard. Petya simultaneously moves with both semiknights. The squares are rather large, so after some move the semiknights can meet, that is, they can end up in the same square. After the meeting the semiknights can move on, so it is possible that they meet again. Petya wonders if there is such sequence of moves when the semiknights meet. Petya considers some squares bad. That is, they do not suit for the meeting. The semiknights can move through these squares but their meetings in these squares don't count.\n\nPetya prepared multiple chess boards. Help Petya find out whether the semiknights can meet on some good square for each board.\n\nPlease see the test case analysis.\nInput specification: The first line contains number *t* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=50) \u2014 the number of boards. Each board is described by a matrix of characters, consisting of 8 rows and 8 columns. The matrix consists of characters \".\", \"#\", \"K\", representing an empty good square, a bad square and the semiknight's position, correspondingly. It is guaranteed that matrix contains exactly 2 semiknights. The semiknight's squares are considered good for the meeting. The tests are separated by empty line..

The semiknight from square (4, 1) goes to square (2, 3) and the semiknight goes from square (8, 1) to square (6, 3). Then both semiknights go to (4, 5) but this square is bad, so they move together to square (2, 7).\n\nOn the second board the semiknights will never meet."}]}}

The third step will transform it into \"abacaba\", and the fourth one - into \"abacabadabacaba\". Thus, the string constructed on the *k*-th step will consist of 2*k*<=-<=1 characters. \n\nPolycarpus wrote down the string he got after 30 steps of the given algorithm and chose two non-empty substrings of it.

Polycarp analyzes each of the obtained numbers and finds the number of those that are divisible by $3$.\n\nFor example, if the original number is $s=3121$, then Polycarp can cut it into three parts with two cuts: $3|1|21$. As a result, he will get two numbers that are divisible by $3$.\n\nPolycarp can make an arbitrary number of vertical cuts, where each cut is made between a pair of adjacent digits. The resulting numbers cannot contain extra leading zeroes (that is, the number can begin with 0 if and only if this number is exactly one character '0'). For example, 007, 01 and 00099 are not valid numbers, but 90, 0 and 10001 are valid.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of numbers divisible by $3$ that Polycarp can obtain?\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains a positive integer $s$. The number of digits of the number $s$ is between $1$ and $2\\cdot10^5$, inclusive. The first (leftmost) digit is not equal to 0.. Output specification: Print the maximum number of numbers divisible by $3$ that Polycarp can get by making vertical cuts in the given number $s$.\nDemo input: ['3121\\n', '6\\n', '1000000000000000000000000000000000\\n', '201920181\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '1\\n', '33\\n', '4\\n']\nNote: In the first example, an example set of optimal cuts on the number is 3|1|21.\n\nIn the second example, you do not need to make any cuts. The specified number 6 forms one number that is divisible by $3$.\n\nIn the third example, cuts must be made between each pair of digits. As a result, Polycarp gets one digit 1 and $33$ digits 0. Each of the $33$ digits 0 forms a number that is divisible by $3$.\n\nIn the fourth example, an example set of optimal cuts is 2|0|1|9|201|81. The numbers $0$, $9$, $201$ and $81$ are divisible by $3$."}]}}

First, he thinks of some set of circles on a plane, and then tries to choose a beautiful set of points, such that there is at least one point from the set inside or on the border of each of the imagined circles.\n\nYesterday Ruslan tried to solve this problem for the case when the set of points is considered beautiful if it is given as (*x**t*<==<=*f*(*t*),<=*y**t*<==<=*g*(*t*)), where argument *t* takes all integer values from 0 to 50. Moreover, *f*(*t*) and *g*(*t*) should be correct functions.\n\nAssume that *w*(*t*) and *h*(*t*) are some correct functions, and *c* is an integer ranging from 0 to 50.

However, he can only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the keys does not exceed *x*. The keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.\n\nVasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest \"Shift\" key is strictly larger than *x*. In this case he will have to use his other hand. Having typed the symbol, Vasya returns other hand back to the chips.\n\nYou are given Vasya's keyboard and the text.

Performing the *i*-th operation removes first two letters of *s* and inserts there a string *b**i*. See the notes section for further clarification.\n\nYou may note that performing an operation decreases the length of a string *s* exactly by 1. Also, for some sets of operations there may be a string that cannot be compressed any further, because the first two letters don't match any *a**i*.\n\nLimak wants to start with a string of length *n* and perform *n*<=-<=1 operations to finally get a one-letter string \"a\".

Formally: we number all the planets from $1$ to $n$. $1$ is Earth, $n$ is Mars. Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt.

Otherwise, print a single number $-1$.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel.\n\nThe answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $10^{-6}$. Formally, let your answer be $p$, and the jury's answer be $q$. Your answer is considered correct if $\\frac{|p - q|}{\\max{(1, |q|)}} \\le 10^{-6}$.\nDemo input: ['2\\n12\\n11 8\\n7 5\\n', '3\\n1\\n1 4 1\\n2 5 3\\n', '6\\n2\\n4 6 3 3 5 6\\n2 6 3 6 5 3\\n'], Demo output: ['10.0000000000\\n', '-1\\n', '85.4800000000\\n']\nNote: Let's consider the first example.\n\nInitially, the mass of a rocket with fuel is $22$ tons.\n-  At take-off from Earth one ton of fuel can lift off $11$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $22$ tons you need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons.-  During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining.-  While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. There will be $14$ tons of rocket with fuel after that.-  During landing on Earth, one ton of fuel can land $7$ tons of cargo, so for landing $14$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel.

Let's say that Moscow is situated at the point with coordinate $0$ km, and Saratov \u2014 at coordinate $n$ km.\n\nDriving for a long time may be really difficult.

When Leha enters a rest site, he may have a rest, and the next kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the kilometer after it \u2014 difficulty $a_2$, and so on.\n\nFor example, if $n = 5$ and there is a rest site in coordinate $2$, the difficulty of journey will be $2a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3$: the first kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the second one \u2014 $a_2$, then Leha will have a rest, and the third kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$, the fourth \u2014 $a_2$, and the last one \u2014 $a_3$. Another example: if $n = 7$ and there are rest sites in coordinates $1$ and $5$, the difficulty of Leha's journey is $3a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3 + a_4$.\n\nLeha doesn't know which integer points contain rest sites. So he has to consider every possible situation. Obviously, there are $2^{n - 1}$ different distributions of rest sites (two distributions are different if there exists some point $x$ such that it contains a rest site in exactly one of these distributions). Leha considers all these distributions to be equiprobable. He wants to calculate $p$ \u2014 the expected value of difficulty of his journey.\n\nObviously, $p \\cdot 2^{n - 1}$ is an integer number. You have to calculate it modulo $998244353$.\nInput specification: The first line contains one number $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^6$) \u2014 the distance from Moscow to Saratov.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integer numbers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($1 \\le a_1 \\le a_2 \\le \\dots \\le a_n \\le 10^6$), where $a_i$ is the difficulty of $i$-th kilometer after Leha has rested.. Output specification: Print one number \u2014 $p \\cdot 2^{n - 1}$, taken modulo $998244353$.\nDemo input: ['2\\n1 2\\n', '4\\n1 3 3 7\\n'], Demo output: ['5\\n', '60\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Ruritania is a country with a very badly maintained road network, which is not exactly good news for lorry drivers that constantly have to do deliveries. In fact, when roads are maintained, they become one-way. It turns out that it is sometimes impossible to get from one town to another in a legal way \u2013 however, we know that all towns are reachable, though illegally!\n\nFortunately for us, the police tend to be very corrupt and they will allow a lorry driver to break the rules and drive in the wrong direction provided they receive \u2018a small gift\u2019. There is one patrol car for every road and they will request 1000 Ruritanian dinars when a driver drives in the wrong direction. However, being greedy, every time a patrol car notices the same driver breaking the rule, they will charge double the amount of money they requested the previous time on that particular road.\n\nBorna is a lorry driver that managed to figure out this bribing pattern. As part of his job, he has to make *K* stops in some towns all over Ruritania and he has to make these stops in a certain order. There are *N* towns (enumerated from 1 to *N*) in Ruritania and Borna\u2019s initial location is the capital city i.e. town 1. He happens to know which ones out of the *N*<=-<=1 roads in Ruritania are currently unidirectional, but he is unable to compute the least amount of money he needs to prepare for bribing the police. Help Borna by providing him with an answer and you will be richly rewarded.\nInput specification: The first line contains *N*, the number of towns in Ruritania. The following *N*<=-<=1 lines contain information regarding individual roads between towns. A road is represented by a tuple of integers (*a*,*b*,*x*), which are separated with a single whitespace character.

Write a python script for the following problem: Mad scientist Mike has just finished constructing a new device to search for extraterrestrial intelligence! He was in such a hurry to launch it for the first time that he plugged in the power wires without giving it a proper glance and started experimenting right away. After a while Mike observed that the wires ended up entangled and now have to be untangled again.\n\nThe device is powered by two wires \"plus\" and \"minus\". The wires run along the floor from the wall (on the left) to the device (on the right). Both the wall and the device have two contacts in them on the same level, into which the wires are plugged in some order. The wires are considered entangled if there are one or more places where one wire runs above the other one. For example, the picture below has four such places (top view):\n\nMike knows the sequence in which the wires run above each other. Mike also noticed that on the left side, the \"plus\" wire is always plugged into the top contact (as seen on the picture). He would like to untangle the wires without unplugging them and without moving the device. Determine if it is possible to do that. A wire can be freely moved and stretched on the floor, but cannot be cut.\n\nTo understand the problem better please read the notes to the test samples.\nInput specification: The single line of the input contains a sequence of characters \"+\" and \"-\" of length *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000). The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) position of the sequence contains the character \"+\", if on the *i*-th step from the wall the \"plus\" wire runs above the \"minus\" wire, and the character \"-\" otherwise..

To untangle the wires, one can first move the \"plus\" wire lower, thus eliminating the two crosses in the middle, and then draw it under the \"minus\" wire, eliminating also the remaining two crosses.\n\nIn the second testcase the \"plus\" wire makes one full revolution around the \"minus\" wire. Thus the wires cannot be untangled: \n\nIn the third testcase the \"plus\" wire simply runs above the \"minus\" wire twice in sequence. The wires can be untangled by lifting \"plus\" and moving it higher: \n\nIn the fourth testcase the \"minus\" wire runs above the \"plus\" wire once.

Write a python script for the following problem: Alas, finding one's true love is not easy. Masha has been unsuccessful in that yet. Her friend Dasha told Masha about a way to determine the phone number of one's Prince Charming through arithmancy. \n\nThe phone number is divined like that. First one needs to write down one's own phone numbers. For example, let's suppose that Masha's phone number is 12345. After that one should write her favorite digit from 0 to 9 under the first digit of her number. That will be the first digit of the needed number. For example, Masha's favorite digit is 9. The second digit is determined as a half sum of the second digit of Masha's number and the already written down first digit from her beloved one's number. In this case the arithmetic average equals to (2<=+<=9)<=/<=2<==<=5.5. Masha can round the number up or down, depending on her wishes. For example, she chooses the digit 5. Having written down the resulting digit under the second digit of her number, Masha moves to finding the third digit in the same way, i.e. finding the half sum the the third digit of her number and the second digit of the new number. The result is (5<=+<=3)<=/<=2<==<=4. In this case the answer is unique. Thus, every *i*-th digit is determined as an arithmetic average of the *i*-th digit of Masha's number and the *i*<=-<=1-th digit of her true love's number.

For example, numbers 2, 3, 5 are prime and numbers 1, 4, 6 are not. \n\nA matrix is prime if at least one of the two following conditions fulfills:\n -  the matrix has a row with prime numbers only; -  the matrix has a column with prime numbers only; \nYour task is to count the minimum number of moves needed to get a prime matrix from the one you've got.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n*,<=*m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=500) \u2014 the number of rows and columns in the matrix, correspondingly.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains *m* integers \u2014 the initial matrix.

Write a python script for the following problem: Bob is a farmer. He has a large pasture with many sheep. Recently, he has lost some of them due to wolf attacks. He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space.

Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Limak is a little polar bear. Polar bears hate long strings and thus they like to compress them. You should also know that Limak is so young that he knows only first six letters of the English alphabet: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' and 'f'.\n\nYou are given a set of *q* possible operations. Limak can perform them in any order, any operation may be applied any number of times. The *i*-th operation is described by a string *a**i* of length two and a string *b**i* of length one. No two of *q* possible operations have the same string *a**i*.\n\nWhen Limak has a string *s* he can perform the *i*-th operation on *s* if the first two letters of *s* match a two-letter string *a**i*. Performing the *i*-th operation removes first two letters of *s* and inserts there a string *b**i*. See the notes section for further clarification.\n\nYou may note that performing an operation decreases the length of a string *s* exactly by 1. Also, for some sets of operations there may be a string that cannot be compressed any further, because the first two letters don't match any *a**i*.\n\nLimak wants to start with a string of length *n* and perform *n*<=-<=1 operations to finally get a one-letter string \"a\". In how many ways can he choose the starting string to be able to get \"a\"? Remember that Limak can use only letters he knows.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *q* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=6, 1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=36)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the initial string and the number of available operations.\n\nThe next *q* lines describe the possible operations.

It's guaranteed that *a**i*<=\u2260<=*a**j* for *i*<=\u2260<=*j* and that all *a**i* and *b**i* consist of only first six lowercase English letters..

There are 4 such strings: \"abb\", \"cab\", \"cca\", \"eea\". The first one Limak can compress using operation 1 two times (changing \"ab\" to a single \"a\"). The first operation would change \"abb\" to \"ab\" and the second operation would change \"ab\" to \"a\".\n\nOther three strings may be compressed as follows: \n -  \"cab\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ab\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"a\" -  \"cca\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ca\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"a\" -  \"eea\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"ca\" <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70a0795f45d32287dba0eb83fc4a3f470c6e5537.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \"a\" \nIn the second sample, the only correct initial string is \"eb\" because it can be immediately compressed to \"a\"."}]}}

Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments.

In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*)..

This position has no obstacle in it.\n\nThe robot can only move up, left, right, or down.\n\nWhen Bob programmed the robot, he wrote down a string of digits consisting of the digits 0 to 3, inclusive.

Unfortunately, he forgot to actually assign the directions to digits.\n\nThe robot will choose some random mapping of digits to distinct directions. The robot will map distinct digits to distinct directions. The robot will then follow the instructions according to the given string in order and chosen mapping. If an instruction would lead the robot to go off the edge of the maze or hit an obstacle, the robot will crash and break down.

Write a python script for the following problem: Little Petya is learning to play chess. He has already learned how to move a king, a rook and a bishop. Let us remind you the rules of moving chess pieces. A chessboard is 64 square fields organized into an 8<=\u00d7<=8 table. A field is represented by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*) \u2014 the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:\n -  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically. -  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally. -  A king moves one field in any direction \u2014 horizontally, vertically or diagonally. \nPetya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2)? At that, we assume that there are no more pieces besides this one on the board. Help him solve this problem.\nInput specification: The input contains four integers *r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2 (1<=\u2264<=*r*1,<=*c*1,<=*r*2,<=*c*2<=\u2264<=8) \u2014 the coordinates of the starting and the final field. The starting field doesn't coincide with the final one.\n\nYou can assume that the chessboard rows are numbered from top to bottom 1 through 8, and the columns are numbered from left to right 1 through 8.. Output specification: Print three space-separated integers: the minimum number of moves the rook, the bishop and the king (in this order) is needed to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2). If a piece cannot make such a move, print a 0 instead of the corresponding number.\nDemo input: ['4 3 1 6\\n', '5 5 5 6\\n'], Demo output: ['2 1 3\\n', '1 0 1\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) portal connects cell *i* and cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*), and one can travel from cell *i* to cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) using the *i*-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) to cell *i* using the *i*-th portal. It is easy to see that because of condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* one can't leave the Line World using portals.\n\nCurrently, I am standing at cell 1, and I want to go to cell *t*.

One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are \"relaxing\".\n\nFor a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap).\n\nIt turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again. \n\nUnhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her. For sure, the shark couldn't say no to her favourite meal, but she had no desire to go back to the dentist. That's why she decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that the viability of no tooth becomes negative. \n\nAs Valerie is not good at mathematics, she asked you to help her to find out the total amount of crucians that she can consume for dinner.\n\nWe should remind you that while eating one crucian Valerie uses exactly one row of teeth and the viability of each tooth from this row decreases by one.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000,<=0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 total amount of Valerie's teeth, amount of tooth rows and amount of crucians in Valerie's portion for dinner.

Write a python script for the following problem: Bear Limak likes watching sports on TV. He is going to watch a game today. The game lasts 90 minutes and there are no breaks.\n\nEach minute can be either interesting or boring. If 15 consecutive minutes are boring then Limak immediately turns TV off.\n\nYou know that there will be *n* interesting minutes *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n*. Your task is to calculate for how many minutes Limak will watch the game.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains one integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=90)\u00a0\u2014 the number of interesting minutes.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n* (1<=\u2264<=*t*1<=&lt;<=*t*2<=&lt;<=... *t**n*<=\u2264<=90), given in the increasing order.. Output specification: Print the number of minutes Limak will watch the game.\nDemo input: ['3\\n7 20 88\\n', '9\\n16 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\\n', '9\\n15 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\\n'], Demo output: ['35\\n', '15\\n', '90\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, minutes 21,\u200922,\u2009...,\u200935 are all boring and thus Limak will turn TV off immediately after the 35-th minute. So, he would watch the game for 35 minutes.\n\nIn the second sample, the first 15 minutes are boring.\n\nIn the third sample, there are no consecutive 15 boring minutes. So, Limak will watch the whole game."}]}}
