Keep the usual amount of comments, but do not add extra explanations outside the code block. Do not remove comments that would normally be included.! Write a python script for the following problem: Limak is a big polar bear. He prepared *n* problems for an algorithmic contest. The *i*-th problem has initial score *p**i*. Also, testers said that it takes *t**i* minutes to solve the *i*-th problem. Problems aren't necessarily sorted by difficulty and maybe harder problems have smaller initial score but it's too late to change it\u00a0\u2014 Limak has already announced initial scores for problems. Though it's still possible to adjust the speed of losing points, denoted by *c* in this statement.\n\nLet *T* denote the total number of minutes needed to solve all problems (so, *T*<==<=*t*1<=+<=*t*2<=+<=...<=+<=*t**n*). The contest will last exactly *T* minutes. So it's just enough to solve all problems.\n\nPoints given for solving a problem decrease linearly. Solving the *i*-th problem after *x* minutes gives exactly  points, where  is some real constant that Limak must choose.\n\nLet's assume that *c* is fixed. During a contest a participant chooses some order in which he or she solves problems. There are *n*! possible orders and each of them gives some total number of points, not necessarily integer. We say that an order is optimal if it gives the maximum number of points. In other words, the total number of points given by this order is greater or equal than the number of points given by any other order. It's obvious that there is at least one optimal order. However, there may be more than one optimal order.\n\nLimak assumes that every participant will properly estimate *t**i* at the very beginning and will choose some optimal order. He also assumes that testers correctly predicted time needed to solve each problem.\n\nFor two distinct problems *i* and *j* such that *p**i*<=&lt;<=*p**j* Limak wouldn't be happy to see a participant with strictly more points for problem *i* than for problem *j*. He calls such a situation a paradox.\n\nIt's not hard to prove that there will be no paradox for *c*<==<=0. The situation may be worse for bigger *c*. What is the maximum real value *c* (remember that ) for which there is no paradox possible, that is, there will be no paradox for any optimal order of solving problems?\n\nIt can be proved that the answer (the maximum *c* as described) always exists.\nInput specification: The first line contains one integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=150<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of problems.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=108)\u00a0\u2014 initial scores.\n\nThe third line contains *n* integers *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n* (1<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=108) where *t**i* is the number of minutes needed to solve the *i*-th problem.. Output specification: Print one real value on a single line\u00a0\u2014 the maximum value of *c* that  and there is no optimal order with a paradox. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10<=-<=6.\n\nNamely: let's assume that your answer is *a*, and the answer of the jury is *b*. The checker program will consider your answer correct if .\nDemo input: ['3\\n4 3 10\\n1 1 8\\n', '4\\n7 20 15 10\\n7 20 15 10\\n', '2\\n10 20\\n10 1\\n'], Demo output: ['0.62500000000\\n', '0.31901840491\\n', '1.00000000000\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, there are 3 problems. The first is (4,\u20091) (initial score is 4 and required time is 1 minute), the second problem is (3,\u20091) and the third one is (10,\u20098). The total time is *T*\u2009=\u20091\u2009+\u20091\u2009+\u20098\u2009=\u200910.\n\nLet's show that there is a paradox for *c*\u2009=\u20090.7. Solving problems in order 1, 2, 3 turns out to give the best total score, equal to the sum of:\n 1.  solved 1 minute after the start: <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/e300b226dba2622235193889de3334147547cfcb.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> 1.  solved 2 minutes after the start: <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/899352b92886f248a9c8e31247a7e4043f9f45e9.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> 1.  solved 10 minutes after the start: <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/ed13f9d5e6cc1ef056b90a9157397d02abab0b16.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> \nSo, this order gives 3.72\u2009+\u20092.58\u2009+\u20093\u2009=\u20099.3 points in total and this is the only optimal order (you can calculate total scores for other 5 possible orders too see that they are lower). You should check points for problems 1 and 3 to see a paradox. There is 4\u2009&lt;\u200910 but 3.72\u2009&gt;\u20093. It turns out that there is no paradox for *c*\u2009=\u20090.625 but there is a paradox for any bigger *c*.\n\nIn the second sample, all 24 orders are optimal.\n\nIn the third sample, even for *c*\u2009=\u20091 there is no paradox."}]}}

Arnie doesn't move along the already built corridors.\n\nHowever, gnawing out corridors in one and the same order any time you change a house is a very difficult activity. That's why Arnie, knowing the order in which the corridors were located in the previous house, wants to gnaw corridors in another order. It is represented as a list of rooms in the order in which they should be visited. The new list should be lexicographically smallest, but it also should be strictly lexicographically greater than the previous one.

It is the number of rooms and corridors in Arnie's house correspondingly. The next line contains *m*<=+<=1 positive integers that do not exceed *n*. They are the description of Arnie's old path represented as a list of rooms he visited during the gnawing. It is guaranteed that the last number in the list coincides with the first one.\n\nThe first room described in the list is the main entrance, that's why Arnie should begin gnawing from it.\n\nYou may assume that there is no room which is connected to itself and there is at most one corridor between any pair of rooms. However, it is possible to find some isolated rooms which are disconnected from others.. Output specification: Print *m*<=+<=1 positive integers that do not exceed *n*. Those numbers are the description of the new path, according to which Arnie should gnaw out his new house. If it is impossible to find new path you should print out No solution. The first number in your answer should be equal to the last one. Also it should be equal to the main entrance.\nDemo input: ['3 3\\n1 2 3 1\\n', '3 3\\n1 3 2 1\\n'], Demo output: ['1 3 2 1 ', 'No solution']\nNote: none"}]}}

By these years you have developed a good tradition \u2014 when it rains, you go on the street and stay silent for a moment, contemplate all around you, enjoy freshness, think about big deeds you have to do. \n\nToday everything had changed quietly. You went on the street with a cup contained water, your favorite drink. In a moment when you were drinking a water you noticed that the process became quite long: the cup still contained water because of rain. You decided to make a formal model of what was happening and to find if it was possible to drink all water in that situation. \n\nThus, your cup is a cylinder with diameter equals *d* centimeters. Initial level of water in cup equals *h* centimeters from the bottom. \n\nYou drink a water with a speed equals *v* milliliters per second. But rain goes with such speed that if you do not drink a water from the cup, the level of water increases on *e* centimeters per second. The process of drinking water from the cup and the addition of rain to the cup goes evenly and continuously. \n\nFind the time needed to make the cup empty or find that it will never happen. It is guaranteed that if it is possible to drink all water, it will happen not later than after 104 seconds.\n\nNote one milliliter equals to one cubic centimeter.\nInput specification: The only line of the input contains four integer numbers *d*,<=*h*,<=*v*,<=*e* (1<=\u2264<=*d*,<=*h*,<=*v*,<=*e*<=\u2264<=104), where:\n -  *d* \u2014 the diameter of your cylindrical cup, -  *h* \u2014 the initial level of water in the cup, -  *v* \u2014 the speed of drinking process from the cup in milliliters per second, -  *e* \u2014 the growth of water because of rain if you do not drink from the cup..

Write a python script for the following problem: Bob is a farmer. He has a large pasture with many sheep. Recently, he has lost some of them due to wolf attacks. He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of dogs.\nDemo input: ['6 6\\n..S...\\n..S.W.\\n.S....\\n..W...\\n...W..\\n......\\n', '1 2\\nSW\\n', '5 5\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS....\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n..SD..\\n..SDW.\\n.SD...\\n.DW...\\nDD.W..\\n......\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS.D..\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n']\nNote: In the first example, we can split the pasture into two halves, one containing wolves and one containing sheep. Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

Then he arranges all his pebbles again (possibly choosing other values of *a* and *b*) and takes back one row, and so on. The game continues until at some point the Beaver ends up with exactly one pebble. \n\nThe game process can be represented as a finite sequence of integers *c*1,<=...,<=*c**k*, where: \n -  *c*1<==<=*n* -  *c**i*<=+<=1 is the number of pebbles that the Beaver ends up with after the *i*-th move, that is, the number of pebbles in a row after some arrangement of *c**i* pebbles (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*k*).

Thus the answer is \"Yes\". \nIn the second sample, the only possible resulting sequence is 2,\u20093,\u20095,\u20098,\u20099,\u200910, which is an increasing sequence and therefore invalid."}]}}

These developments are encoded and stored in a large safe. The Beaver's teeth are strong enough, so the authorities assured that upon arriving at the place the beaver won't have any problems with opening the safe.\n\nAnd he finishes his aspen sprig and leaves for this important task. Of course, the Beaver arrived at the location without any problems, but alas. He can't open the safe with his strong and big teeth. At this point, the Smart Beaver get a call from the headquarters and learns that opening the safe with the teeth is not necessary, as a reliable source has sent the following information: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. There also is a special hint, which can be used to open the safe. The hint is string *s* with the following structure:\n -  if *s**i* = \"?\", then the digit that goes *i*-th in the safe code can be anything (between 0 to 9, inclusively); -  if *s**i* is a digit (between 0 to 9, inclusively), then it means that there is digit *s**i* on position *i* in code; -  if the string contains letters from \"A\" to \"J\", then all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits and the positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits. -  The length of the safe code coincides with the length of the hint. \nFor example, hint \"?JGJ9\" has such matching safe code variants: \"51919\", \"55959\", \"12329\", \"93539\" and so on, and has wrong variants such as: \"56669\", \"00111\", \"03539\" and \"13666\".\n\nAfter receiving such information, the authorities change the plan and ask the special agents to work quietly and gently and not to try to open the safe by mechanical means, and try to find the password using the given hint.\n\nAt a special agent school the Smart Beaver was the fastest in his platoon finding codes for such safes, but now he is not in that shape: the years take their toll ...

The field is valid if for each cell: \n -  if there is a digit $k$ in the cell, then exactly $k$ neighboring cells have bombs. -  if the cell is empty, then all neighboring cells have no bombs. \nTwo cells are neighbors if they have a common side or a corner (i.\u00a0e. a cell has at most $8$ neighboring cells).\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 100$) \u2014 the sizes of the field.\n\nThe next $n$ lines contain the description of the field. Each line contains $m$ characters, each of them is \".\" (if this cell is empty), \"*\" (if there is bomb in this cell), or a digit from $1$ to $8$, inclusive.. Output specification: Print \"YES\", if the field is valid and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrarily.\nDemo input: ['3 3\\n111\\n1*1\\n111\\n', '2 4\\n*.*.\\n1211\\n'], Demo output: ['YES', 'NO']\nNote: In the second example the answer is \"NO\" because, if the positions of the bombs are preserved, the first line of the field should be *2*1.\n\nYou can read more about Minesweeper in [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game))."}]}}

Besides, the keys are of two types. Some of the keys have lowercase Latin letters on them and some of the keys work like the \"Shift\" key on standard keyboards, that is, they make lowercase letters uppercase.\n\nVasya can press one or two keys with one hand. However, he can only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the keys does not exceed *x*. The keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.\n\nVasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest \"Shift\" key is strictly larger than *x*. In this case he will have to use his other hand. Having typed the symbol, Vasya returns other hand back to the chips.\n\nYou are given Vasya's keyboard and the text. Count the minimum number of times Vasya will have to use the other hand.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *x* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=30,<=1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=50).\n\nNext *n* lines contain descriptions of all the keyboard keys.

But if number *x* at some point of time gets to the square with the same number then both numbers add to each other and result in 2*x*. The new number 2*x* continues moving to the beginning of the stripe by the same rules. \nAfter the final stop of the number moving process, the infinity gets a new number 2 or 4 and the process repeats. Read the notes to the test samples to better understand the moving strategy.\n\nI guess you've understood that the game progress fully depends on the order in which numbers 2 and 4 appear. Let's look at some sequence of numbers 2 and 4 in the game. We assume that the sequence is winning if it results in at least one square getting the number greater or equal than 2*k*. \n\nThe goal of the game is to make up a winning sequence of *n* numbers. But not everything is so simple, some numbers in the sequence are identified beforehand. You are given a sequence consisting of numbers 0, 2, 4. Count how many ways there are to replace each 0 of the sequence with 2 or 4 to get a winning sequence.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2000;\u00a03<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=11). The next line contains sequence of *n* integers, each of them is either 0, or 2, or 4.. Output specification: Print a single integer \u2014 the number of ways to replace zeroes by numbers 2 or 4 to get a winning sequence. As this number can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (109<=+<=7).\nDemo input: ['7 4\\n2 2 4 2 2 2 2\\n', '1 3\\n0\\n', '2 3\\n0 4\\n', '5 4\\n2 0 0 4 4\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '0\\n', '1\\n', '2\\n']\nNote: Consider the first example. The beginning of the strip will look as follows: \n\n2 \u2009\u2192\u2009 4 \u2009\u2192\u2009 8 \u2009\u2192\u2009 8 2 \u2009\u2192\u2009 8 4 \u2009\u2192\u2009 8 4 2 \u2009\u2192\u2009 16.\n\nTo better understand the game, you can see the original game on http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/. Please note that the game that is described on the strip is slightly different from the original game (when the two numbers add up in the original game, they do not keep moving). Be careful, the game is addictive, there isn't much time for the contest!"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: *T* is a complete binary tree consisting of *n* vertices. It means that exactly one vertex is a root, and each vertex is either a leaf (and doesn't have children) or an inner node (and has exactly two children). All leaves of a complete binary tree have the same depth (distance from the root). So *n* is a number such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nIn the picture you can see a complete binary tree with *n*<==<=15.\n\nVertices are numbered from 1 to *n* in a special recursive way: we recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the left subtree (if current vertex is not a leaf), then assign a number to the current vertex, and then recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the right subtree (if it exists). In the picture vertices are numbered exactly using this algorithm. It is clear that for each size of a complete binary tree exists exactly one way to give numbers to all vertices. This way of numbering is called symmetric.\n\nYou have to write a program that for given *n* answers *q* queries to the tree.\n\nEach query consists of an integer number *u**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) and a string *s**i*, where *u**i* is the number of vertex, and *s**i* represents the path starting from this vertex. String *s**i* doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U', which mean traverse to the left child, to the right child and to the parent, respectively. Characters from *s**i* have to be processed from left to right, considering that *u**i* is the vertex where the path starts. If it's impossible to process a character (for example, to go to the left child of a leaf), then you have to skip it. The answer is the number of vertex where the path represented by *s**i* ends.\n\nFor example, if *u**i*<==<=4 and *s**i*<==<=\u00abUURL\u00bb, then the answer is 10.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integer numbers *n* and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1018, *q*<=\u2265<=1). *n* is such that *n*<=+<=1 is a power of 2.\n\nThe next 2*q* lines represent queries; each query consists of two consecutive lines.

Write a python script for the following problem: Natasha is going to fly on a rocket to Mars and return to Earth. Also, on the way to Mars, she will land on $n - 2$ intermediate planets. Formally: we number all the planets from $1$ to $n$. $1$ is Earth, $n$ is Mars. Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \\to 2 \\to \\ldots n \\to 1$.\n\nFlight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $2$-nd planet $\\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\\to$ $\\ldots$ $\\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\\to$ the $n$-th planet $\\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\\to$ the $1$-st planet.\n\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet. \n\nFor example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \\cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons. \n\nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\n\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt.

Output specification: If Natasha can fly to Mars through $(n - 2)$ planets and return to Earth, print the minimum mass of fuel (in tons) that Natasha should take. Otherwise, print a single number $-1$.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel.\n\nThe answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $10^{-6}$. Formally, let your answer be $p$, and the jury's answer be $q$. Your answer is considered correct if $\\frac{|p - q|}{\\max{(1, |q|)}} \\le 10^{-6}$.\nDemo input: ['2\\n12\\n11 8\\n7 5\\n', '3\\n1\\n1 4 1\\n2 5 3\\n', '6\\n2\\n4 6 3 3 5 6\\n2 6 3 6 5 3\\n'], Demo output: ['10.0000000000\\n', '-1\\n', '85.4800000000\\n']\nNote: Let's consider the first example.\n\nInitially, the mass of a rocket with fuel is $22$ tons.\n-  At take-off from Earth one ton of fuel can lift off $11$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $22$ tons you need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons.-  During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining.-  While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. There will be $14$ tons of rocket with fuel after that.-  During landing on Earth, one ton of fuel can land $7$ tons of cargo, so for landing $14$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight is $12$ tons, that is, a rocket without any fuel.\nIn the second case, the rocket will not be able even to take off from Earth."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: By 2312 there were *n* Large Hadron Colliders in the inhabited part of the universe. Each of them corresponded to a single natural number from 1 to *n*. However, scientists did not know what activating several colliders simultaneously could cause, so the colliders were deactivated.\n\nIn 2312 there was a startling discovery: a collider's activity is safe if and only if all numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other (two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor equals 1)! If two colliders with relatively nonprime numbers are activated, it will cause a global collapse.\n\nUpon learning this, physicists rushed to turn the colliders on and off and carry out all sorts of experiments. To make sure than the scientists' quickness doesn't end with big trouble, the Large Hadron Colliders' Large Remote Control was created. You are commissioned to write the software for the remote (well, you do not expect anybody to operate it manually, do you?).\n\nInitially, all colliders are deactivated. Your program receives multiple requests of the form \"activate/deactivate the *i*-th collider\". The program should handle requests in the order of receiving them. The program should print the processed results in the format described below.\n\nTo the request of \"+ i\" (that is, to activate the *i*-th collider), the program should print exactly one of the following responses: \n -  \"Success\" if the activation was successful. -  \"Already on\", if the *i*-th collider was already activated before the request. -  \"Conflict with j\", if there is a conflict with the *j*-th collider (that is, the *j*-th collider is on, and numbers *i* and *j* are not relatively prime). In this case, the *i*-th collider shouldn't be activated. If a conflict occurs with several colliders simultaneously, you should print the number of any of them. \nThe request of \"- i\" (that is, to deactivate the *i*-th collider), should receive one of the following responses from the program: \n -  \"Success\", if the deactivation was successful. -  \"Already off\", if the *i*-th collider was already deactivated before the request. \nYou don't need to print quotes in the output of the responses to the requests.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of colliders and the number of requests, correspondingly.\n\nNext *m* lines contain numbers of requests, one per line, in the form of either \"+ i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 activate the *i*-th collider, or \"-\u00a0i\" (without the quotes) \u2014 deactivate the *i*-th collider (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*)..

Write a python script for the following problem: Roger is a robot. He has an arm that is a series of *n* segments connected to each other. The endpoints of the *i*-th segment are initially located at points (*i*<=-<=1,<=0) and (*i*,<=0). The endpoint at (*i*<=-<=1,<=0) is colored red and the endpoint at (*i*,<=0) is colored blue for all segments. Thus, the blue endpoint of the *i*-th segment is touching the red endpoint of the (*i*<=+<=1)-th segment for all valid *i*.\n\nRoger can move his arm in two different ways: \n 1.  He can choose some segment and some value. This is denoted as choosing the segment number *i* and picking some positive *l*. This change happens as follows: the red endpoint of segment number *i* and segments from 1 to *i*<=-<=1 are all fixed in place. Imagine a ray from the red endpoint to the blue endpoint. The blue endpoint and segments *i*<=+<=1 through *n* are translated *l* units in the direction of this ray.   In this picture, the red point labeled *A* and segments before *A* stay in place, while the blue point labeled *B* and segments after *B* gets translated.1.  He can choose a segment and rotate it. This is denoted as choosing the segment number *i*, and an angle *a*. The red endpoint of the *i*-th segment will stay fixed in place. The blue endpoint of that segment and segments *i*<=+<=1 to *n* will rotate clockwise by an angle of *a* degrees around the red endpoint.   In this picture, the red point labeled *A* and segments before *A* stay in place, while the blue point labeled *B* and segments after *B* get rotated around point *A*. \nRoger will move his arm *m* times. These transformations are a bit complicated, and Roger easily loses track of where the blue endpoint of the last segment is. Help him compute the coordinates of the blue endpoint of the last segment after applying each operation. Note that these operations are cumulative, and Roger's arm may intersect itself arbitrarily during the moves.\nInput specification: The first line of the input will contain two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=300<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of segments and the number of operations to perform.\n\nEach of the next *m* lines contains three integers *x**i*, *y**i* and *z**i* describing a move.

Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:\n -  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically. -  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally. -  A king moves one field in any direction \u2014 horizontally, vertically or diagonally. \nPetya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2)?

All *t**i* are distinct.\n\nTo perform the *i*-th task you need *k**i* servers which are unoccupied in the second *t**i*. After the servers begin to perform the task, each of them will be busy over the next *d**i* seconds. Thus, they will be busy in seconds *t**i*,<=*t**i*<=+<=1,<=...,<=*t**i*<=+<=*d**i*<=-<=1.

There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.\n\nVasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest \"Shift\" key is strictly larger than *x*. In this case he will have to use his other hand. Having typed the symbol, Vasya returns other hand back to the chips.\n\nYou are given Vasya's keyboard and the text.

For some integer numbers $x$ and $d$, he chooses an arbitrary position $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$) and for every $j \\in [1, n]$ adds $x + d \\cdot dist(i, j)$ to the value of the $j$-th cell. $dist(i, j)$ is the distance between positions $i$ and $j$ (i.e. $dist(i, j) = |i - j|$, where $|x|$ is an absolute value of $x$).\n\nFor example, if Alice currently has an array $[2, 1, 2, 2]$ and Bob chooses position $3$ for $x = -1$ and $d = 2$ then the array will become $[2 - 1 + 2 \\cdot 2,~1 - 1 + 2 \\cdot 1,~2 - 1 + 2 \\cdot 0,~2 - 1 + 2 \\cdot 1]$ = $[5, 2, 1, 3]$. Note that Bob can't choose position $i$ outside of the array (that is, smaller than $1$ or greater than $n$).\n\nAlice will be the happiest when the elements of the array are as big as possible. Bob claimed that the arithmetic mean value of the elements will work fine as a metric.\n\nWhat is the maximum arithmetic mean value Bob can achieve?\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 10^5$) \u2014 the number of elements of the array and the number of changes.\n\nEach of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $d_i$ ($-10^3 \\le x_i, d_i \\le 10^3$) \u2014 the parameters for the $i$-th change..

He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.\n\nOne day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.\nInput specification: There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number. It is guaranteed that the numbers are made from 0 and 1 only and that their length is same. The numbers may start with 0. The length of each number doesn't exceed 100..

He has even invented a new variant of chess, which he named \u00abPawnChess\u00bb.\n\nThis new game is played on a board consisting of 8 rows and 8 columns. At the beginning of every game some black and white pawns are placed on the board. The number of black pawns placed is not necessarily equal to the number of white pawns placed. \n\nLets enumerate rows and columns with integers from 1 to 8. Rows are numbered from top to bottom, while columns are numbered from left to right. Now we denote as (*r*,<=*c*) the cell located at the row *r* and at the column *c*.\n\nThere are always two players A and B playing the game. Player A plays with white pawns, while player B plays with black ones. The goal of player A is to put any of his pawns to the row 1, while player B tries to put any of his pawns to the row 8. As soon as any of the players completes his goal the game finishes immediately and the succeeded player is declared a winner.\n\nPlayer A moves first and then they alternate turns. On his move player A must choose exactly one white pawn and move it one step upward and player B (at his turn) must choose exactly one black pawn and move it one step down. Any move is possible only if the targeted cell is empty. It's guaranteed that for any scenario of the game there will always be at least one move available for any of the players.\n\nMoving upward means that the pawn located in (*r*,<=*c*) will go to the cell (*r*<=-<=1,<=*c*), while moving down means the pawn located in (*r*,<=*c*) will go to the cell (*r*<=+<=1,<=*c*). Again, the corresponding cell must be empty, i.e. not occupied by any other pawn of any color.\n\nGiven the initial disposition of the board, determine who wins the game if both players play optimally. Note that there will always be a winner due to the restriction that for any game scenario both players will have some moves available.\nInput specification: The input consists of the board description given in eight lines, each line contains eight characters. Character 'B' is used to denote a black pawn, and character 'W' represents a white pawn. Empty cell is marked with '.'. \n\nIt's guaranteed that there will not be white pawns on the first row neither black pawns on the last row.. Output specification: Print 'A' if player A wins the game on the given board, and 'B' if player B will claim the victory. Again, it's guaranteed that there will always be a winner on the given board.\nDemo input: ['........\\n........\\n.B....B.\\n....W...\\n........\\n..W.....\\n........\\n........\\n', '..B.....\\n..W.....\\n......B.\\n........\\n.....W..\\n......B.\\n........\\n........\\n'], Demo output: ['A\\n', 'B\\n']\nNote: In the first sample player A is able to complete his goal in 3 steps by always moving a pawn initially located at (4,\u20095). Player B needs at least 5 steps for any of his pawns to reach the row 8. Hence, player A will be the winner."}]}}

He thus decided to place some shepherd dogs in such a way that all his sheep are protected.\n\nThe pasture is a rectangle consisting of *R*<=\u00d7<=*C* cells. Each cell is either empty, contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it. However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog.\n\nInitially there are no dogs. Place dogs onto the pasture in such a way that no wolf can reach any sheep, or determine that it is impossible. Note that since you have many dogs, you do not need to minimize their number.\nInput specification: First line contains two integers *R* (1<=\u2264<=*R*<=\u2264<=500) and *C* (1<=\u2264<=*C*<=\u2264<=500), denoting the number of rows and the numbers of columns respectively.\n\nEach of the following *R* lines is a string consisting of exactly *C* characters, representing one row of the pasture. Here, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf and '.' an empty cell.. Output specification: If it is impossible to protect all sheep, output a single line with the word \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, output a line with the word \"Yes\". Then print *R* lines, representing the pasture after placing dogs. Again, 'S' means a sheep, 'W' a wolf, 'D' is a dog and '.' an empty space. You are not allowed to move, remove or add a sheep or a wolf.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of dogs.\nDemo input: ['6 6\\n..S...\\n..S.W.\\n.S....\\n..W...\\n...W..\\n......\\n', '1 2\\nSW\\n', '5 5\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS....\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n..SD..\\n..SDW.\\n.SD...\\n.DW...\\nDD.W..\\n......\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n.S...\\n...S.\\nS.D..\\n...S.\\n.S...\\n']\nNote: In the first example, we can split the pasture into two halves, one containing wolves and one containing sheep. Note that the sheep at (2,1) is safe, as wolves cannot move diagonally.\n\nIn the second example, there are no empty spots to put dogs that would guard the lone sheep.\n\nIn the third example, there are no wolves, so the task is very easy. We put a dog in the center to observe the peacefulness of the meadow, but the solution would be correct even without him."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: After the contest in comparing numbers, Shapur's teacher found out that he is a real genius and that no one could possibly do the calculations faster than him even using a super computer!\n\nSome days before the contest, the teacher took a very simple-looking exam and all his *n* students took part in the exam. The teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation.\n\nUnfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.\n\nNow the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers.\n\nShapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: \n -  As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. -  As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include \"-\", \";\" and \"_\". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. -  The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600 -  My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. -  Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN -  You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong. Do this by writing \"WA\" for Wrong answer or \"ACC\" for a correct answer. -  I should remind you that none of the strings (initial strings or answers) are empty. -  Finally, do these as soon as possible. You have less than 2 hours to complete this.\nInput specification: The first three lines contain a string each. These are the initial strings. They consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). All the initial strings have length from 1 to 100, inclusively.\n\nIn the fourth line there is a single integer *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000), the number of students.\n\nNext *n* lines contain a student's answer each. It is guaranteed that the answer meets what the teacher said. Each answer iconsists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). Length is from 1 to 600, inclusively.. Output specification: For each student write in a different line.

Polycarpus uses the alphabet that consists of lowercase Latin letters and digits (a total of 36 characters). The alphabet characters are numbered like this: the 1-st character is \"a\", the 2-nd \u2014 \"b\", ..., the 26-th \u2014 \"z\", the 27-th \u2014 \"0\", the 28-th \u2014 \"1\", ..., the 36-th \u2014 \"9\". \nLet's have a closer look at the algorithm. On the second step Polycarpus will concatenate two strings \"a\" and insert the character \"b\" between them, resulting in \"aba\" string. The third step will transform it into \"abacaba\", and the fourth one - into \"abacabadabacaba\". Thus, the string constructed on the *k*-th step will consist of 2*k*<=-<=1 characters. \n\nPolycarpus wrote down the string he got after 30 steps of the given algorithm and chose two non-empty substrings of it.

In other words, this rule describes the strings where first go zero or more uppercase letters, and then \u2014 zero or more lowercase letters.\n\nTo make the message fancy, Patrick can erase some letter and add the same letter in the same place in the opposite case (that is, he can replace an uppercase letter with the lowercase one and vice versa). Patrick got interested in the following question: what minimum number of actions do we need to make a message fancy? Changing a letter's case in the message counts as one action. Patrick cannot perform any other actions.\nInput specification: The only line of the input contains a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters. The string's length does not exceed 105.. Output specification: Print a single number \u2014 the least number of actions needed to make the message fancy.\nDemo input: ['PRuvetSTAaYA\\n', 'OYPROSTIYAOPECHATALSYAPRIVETSTASYA\\n', 'helloworld\\n'], Demo output: ['5\\n', '0\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Also, each card earns some value in points assigned to it: cards with value from two to ten earn from 2 to 10 points, correspondingly. An ace can either earn 1 or 11, whatever the player wishes. The picture cards (king, queen and jack) earn 10 points. The number of points a card earns does not depend on the suit. The rules of the game are very simple. The player gets two cards, if the sum of points of those cards equals *n*, then the player wins, otherwise the player loses.\n\nThe player has already got the first card, it's the queen of spades.

Specifically, the order went like this:\n-  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is strictly less than 0.5, then the rounded up number coincides with the number\u2019s integer part. -  If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is not less than 0.5, the rounded up number is obtained if we add 1 to the last digit of the number\u2019s integer part.-  If the number\u2019s integer part ends with digit 9, to round up the numbers one should go to Vasilisa the Wise.

He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.\n\nOne day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.\n\nIn his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.\n\nShapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.\n\nNow you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.\nInput specification: There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number.

He's allowed to do exactly one move: he chooses two indices *i* and *j* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*j*<=\u2264<=*n*) and flips all values *a**k* for which their positions are in range [*i*,<=*j*] (that is *i*<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*j*). Flip the value of *x* means to apply operation *x*<==<=1 - *x*.\n\nThe goal of the game is that after exactly one move to obtain the maximum number of ones. Write a program to solve the little game of Iahub.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100). In the second line of the input there are *n* integers: *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. It is guaranteed that each of those *n* values is either 0 or 1.. Output specification: Print an integer \u2014 the maximal number of 1s that can be obtained after exactly one move.\nDemo input: ['5\\n1 0 0 1 0\\n', '4\\n1 0 0 1\\n'], Demo output: ['4\\n', '4\\n']\nNote: In the first case, flip the segment from 2 to 5 (*i*\u2009=\u20092,\u2009*j*\u2009=\u20095). That flip changes the sequence, it becomes: [1 1 1 0 1]. So, it contains four ones. There is no way to make the whole sequence equal to [1 1 1 1 1].\n\nIn the second case, flipping only the second and the third element (*i*\u2009=\u20092,\u2009*j*\u2009=\u20093) will turn all numbers into 1."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Valentin participates in a show called \"Shockers\". The rules are quite easy: jury selects one letter which Valentin doesn't know. He should make a small speech, but every time he pronounces a word that contains the selected letter, he receives an electric shock. He can make guesses which letter is selected, but for each incorrect guess he receives an electric shock too. The show ends when Valentin guesses the selected letter correctly.\n\nValentin can't keep in mind everything, so he could guess the selected letter much later than it can be uniquely determined and get excessive electric shocks. Excessive electric shocks are those which Valentin got after the moment the selected letter can be uniquely determined. You should find out the number of excessive electric shocks.\nInput specification: The first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of actions Valentin did.\n\nThe next *n* lines contain descriptions of his actions, each line contains description of one action. Each action can be of one of three types: \n 1.  Valentin pronounced some word and didn't get an electric shock. This action is described by the string \". w\" (without quotes), in which \".\" is a dot (ASCII-code 46), and *w* is the word that Valentin said. 1.  Valentin pronounced some word and got an electric shock. This action is described by the string \"! w\" (without quotes), in which \"!\" is an exclamation mark (ASCII-code 33), and *w* is the word that Valentin said. 1.  Valentin made a guess about the selected letter. This action is described by the string \"? s\" (without quotes), in which \"?\" is a question mark (ASCII-code 63), and *s* is the guess\u00a0\u2014 a lowercase English letter. \nAll words consist only of lowercase English letters. The total length of all words does not exceed 105.\n\nIt is guaranteed that last action is a guess about the selected letter. Also, it is guaranteed that Valentin didn't make correct guesses about the selected letter before the last action. Moreover, it's guaranteed that if Valentin got an electric shock after pronouncing some word, then it contains the selected letter; and also if Valentin didn't get an electric shock after pronouncing some word, then it does not contain the selected letter.. Output specification: Output a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of electric shocks that Valentin could have avoided if he had told the selected letter just after it became uniquely determined.\nDemo input: ['5\\n! abc\\n. ad\\n. b\\n! cd\\n? c\\n', '8\\n! hello\\n! codeforces\\n? c\\n. o\\n? d\\n? h\\n. l\\n? e\\n', '7\\n! ababahalamaha\\n? a\\n? b\\n? a\\n? b\\n? a\\n? h\\n'], Demo output: ['1\\n', '2\\n', '0\\n']\nNote: In the first test case after the first action it becomes clear that the selected letter is one of the following: *a*,\u2009*b*,\u2009*c*.

Write a python script for the following problem: Vasya studies music. \n\nHe has learned lots of interesting stuff. For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\n\nVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads \u2014 major and minor.\n\nLet's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes *X*, *Y* and *Z*. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between *X* and *Y* equals 4 semitones and the distance between *Y* and *Z* is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between *X* and *Z*, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.\n\nA minor triad is different in that the distance between *X* and *Y* should be 3 semitones and between *Y* and *Z* \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nFor example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nHelp Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\nInput specification: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.. Output specification: Print \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\nDemo input: ['C E G\\n', 'C# B F\\n', 'A B H\\n'], Demo output: ['major\\n', 'minor\\n', 'strange\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Implement this operation and the Empire won't forget you.\nInput specification: The first input line contains two space-separated integers *n*, *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) that show how many numbers the first set (the numerator) and the second set (the denominator) contain, correspondingly.\n\nThe second line contains *n* space-separated integers: *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=107) \u2014 the numbers that are multiplied to produce the numerator.\n\nThe third line contains *m* space-separated integers: *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=107) \u2014 the numbers that are multiplied to produce the denominator.. Output specification: Print the answer to the problem in the form, similar to the form of the input data. The number of values in the sets you print *n**out*,<=*m**out* must satisfy the inequality 1<=\u2264<=*n**out*,<=*m**out*<=\u2264<=105, and the actual values in the sets *a**out*,<=*i* and *b**out*,<=*i* must satisfy the inequality 1<=\u2264<=*a**out*,<=*i*,<=*b**out*,<=*i*<=\u2264<=107. \n\nSeparate the values in the lines by spaces. The printed fraction must be reduced, that is, there mustn't be such integer *x* (*x*<=&gt;<=1), that the numerator and the denominator of the printed fraction are divisible by *x*. If there are several matching answers, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['3 2\\n100 5 2\\n50 10\\n', '4 3\\n2 5 10 20\\n100 1 3\\n'], Demo output: ['2 3\\n2 1\\n1 1 1\\n', '1 1\\n20\\n3\\n']\nNote: In the first test sample the numerator equals 1000, the denominator equals 500. If we reduce fraction 1000/500 by the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator (by 500), we obtain fraction 2/1.\n\nIn the second test sample the numerator equals 2000, the denominator equals 300. If we reduce fraction 2000/300 by the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator (by 100), we obtain fraction 20/3."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Petya got interested in grammar on his third year in school. He invented his own language called Petya's. Petya wanted to create a maximally simple language that would be enough to chat with friends, that's why all the language's grammar can be described with the following set of rules:\n-  There are three parts of speech: the adjective, the noun, the verb. Each word in his language is an adjective, noun or verb. -  There are two genders: masculine and feminine. Each word in his language has gender either masculine or feminine. -  Masculine adjectives end with -lios, and feminine adjectives end with -liala. -  Masculine nouns end with -etr, and feminime nouns end with -etra. -  Masculine verbs end with -initis, and feminime verbs end with -inites. -  Thus, each word in the Petya's language has one of the six endings, given above. There are no other endings in Petya's language. -  It is accepted that the whole word consists of an ending. That is, words \"lios\", \"liala\", \"etr\" and so on belong to the Petya's language. -  There aren't any punctuation marks, grammatical tenses, singular/plural forms or other language complications. -  A sentence is either exactly one valid language word or exactly one statement. \nStatement is any sequence of the Petya's language, that satisfy both conditions:\n-  Words in statement follow in the following order (from the left to the right): zero or more adjectives followed by exactly one noun followed by zero or more verbs. -  All words in the statement should have the same gender.\nAfter Petya's friend Vasya wrote instant messenger (an instant messaging program) that supported the Petya's language, Petya wanted to add spelling and grammar checking to the program. As Vasya was in the country and Petya didn't feel like waiting, he asked you to help him with this problem.

Write a python script for the following problem: A famous Berland's painter Kalevitch likes to shock the public. One of his last obsessions is chess. For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards.\n\nAs before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8<=\u00d7<=8 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke.\n\nKalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client's requirements.\n\nIt goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything \u2014 for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's needs. You are asked to help Kalevitch with this task.\nInput specification: The input file contains 8 lines, each of the lines contains 8 characters. The given matrix describes the client's requirements, W character stands for a white square, and B character \u2014 for a square painted black.\n\nIt is guaranteed that client's requirments can be fulfilled with a sequence of allowed strokes (vertical/column or horizontal/row)..

The sorting of the first-years into houses is done by the Sorting Hat. The pupils are called one by one in the alphabetical order, each of them should put a hat on his head and, after some thought, the hat solemnly announces the name of the house the student should enter.\n\nAt that the Hat is believed to base its considerations on the student's personal qualities: it sends the brave and noble ones to Gryffindor, the smart and shrewd ones \u2014 to Ravenclaw, the persistent and honest ones \u2014 to Hufflepuff and the clever and cunning ones \u2014 to Slytherin. However, a first year student Hermione Granger got very concerned about the forthcoming sorting. She studied all the literature on the Sorting Hat and came to the conclusion that it is much simpler than that. If the relatives of the student have already studied at Hogwarts, the hat puts the student to the same house, where his family used to study. In controversial situations, when the relatives studied in different houses or when they were all Muggles like Hermione's parents, then the Hat sorts the student to the house, to which the least number of first years has been sent at that moment. If there are several such houses, the choice is given to the student himself. Then the student can choose any of the houses, to which the least number of first years has been sent so far. \n\nHermione has already asked the students that are on the list before her about their relatives. Now she and her new friends Harry Potter and Ron Weasley want to find out into what house the Hat will put Hermione.\nInput specification: The first input line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=10000). It is the number of students who are in the list before Hermione. The next line contains *n* symbols.

The second disciple is given the choice between the houses where the least number of students has been sent, i.e. Gryffindor, Slytherin and Ravenclaw. If he chooses Gryffindor, Hermione is forced to choose between Ravenclaw and Slytherin, if he chooses Ravenclaw, Hermione will choose between Gryffindor and Slytherin, if he chooses Slytherin, Hermione will choose between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw. In the end, the following situation is possible (it depends on the choice of the second student and Hermione). Hermione will end up 1) in Gryffindor, 2) in Ravenclaw, 3) in Slytherin.

He would like to untangle the wires without unplugging them and without moving the device. Determine if it is possible to do that. A wire can be freely moved and stretched on the floor, but cannot be cut.\n\nTo understand the problem better please read the notes to the test samples.\nInput specification: The single line of the input contains a sequence of characters \"+\" and \"-\" of length *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000). The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) position of the sequence contains the character \"+\", if on the *i*-th step from the wall the \"plus\" wire runs above the \"minus\" wire, and the character \"-\" otherwise.. Output specification: Print either \"Yes\" (without the quotes) if the wires can be untangled or \"No\" (without the quotes) if the wires cannot be untangled.\nDemo input: ['-++-\\n', '+-\\n', '++\\n', '-\\n'], Demo output: ['Yes\\n', 'No\\n', 'Yes\\n', 'No\\n']\nNote: The first testcase corresponds to the picture in the statement. To untangle the wires, one can first move the \"plus\" wire lower, thus eliminating the two crosses in the middle, and then draw it under the \"minus\" wire, eliminating also the remaining two crosses.\n\nIn the second testcase the \"plus\" wire makes one full revolution around the \"minus\" wire. Thus the wires cannot be untangled: \n\nIn the third testcase the \"plus\" wire simply runs above the \"minus\" wire twice in sequence. The wires can be untangled by lifting \"plus\" and moving it higher: \n\nIn the fourth testcase the \"minus\" wire runs above the \"plus\" wire once. The wires cannot be untangled without moving the device itself:"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Mad scientist Mike has just finished constructing a new device to search for extraterrestrial intelligence! He was in such a hurry to launch it for the first time that he plugged in the power wires without giving it a proper glance and started experimenting right away. After a while Mike observed that the wires ended up entangled and now have to be untangled again.\n\nThe device is powered by two wires \"plus\" and \"minus\". The wires run along the floor from the wall (on the left) to the device (on the right). Both the wall and the device have two contacts in them on the same level, into which the wires are plugged in some order. The wires are considered entangled if there are one or more places where one wire runs above the other one. For example, the picture below has four such places (top view):\n\nMike knows the sequence in which the wires run above each other. Mike also noticed that on the left side, the \"plus\" wire is always plugged into the top contact (as seen on the picture). He would like to untangle the wires without unplugging them and without moving the device. Determine if it is possible to do that. A wire can be freely moved and stretched on the floor, but cannot be cut.\n\nTo understand the problem better please read the notes to the test samples.\nInput specification: The single line of the input contains a sequence of characters \"+\" and \"-\" of length *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000).

To untangle the wires, one can first move the \"plus\" wire lower, thus eliminating the two crosses in the middle, and then draw it under the \"minus\" wire, eliminating also the remaining two crosses.\n\nIn the second testcase the \"plus\" wire makes one full revolution around the \"minus\" wire. Thus the wires cannot be untangled: \n\nIn the third testcase the \"plus\" wire simply runs above the \"minus\" wire twice in sequence. The wires can be untangled by lifting \"plus\" and moving it higher: \n\nIn the fourth testcase the \"minus\" wire runs above the \"plus\" wire once.

The insurgents suppose that this polygon is developing new deadly weapon. The polygon consists of *n* missile silos connected by bidirectional underground passages. The passages are linked to laboratories where research is conducted. Naturally, the passages are guarded severely: the passage between silos *i* and *j* is patrolled by *c**i*,<=*j* war droids.\n\nThe insurgents studied the polygon plan and noticed its unusual structure. As it turned out, for any *k*-element set of silos *S* there is exactly one silo that is directly connected by a passage with each silo from *S* (we'll call this silo adjacent with *S*). Having considered that, the insurgents decided to act as follows:\n 1.  they choose a *k*-element set of silos *S*; 1.  a group of scouts lands from the air into each silo from *S*; 1.  each group moves along the corresponding passage to the silo, adjacent with *S* (as the scouts move, they check out the laboratories and watch for any signs of weapon blueprints); 1.  in the silo, adjacent with *S*, the groups get on the ship and fly away. \nThe danger of the operation is the total number of droids that patrol the passages through which the scouts will go. The danger of the operation obviously only depends on the way to choose set *S*. The insurgents haven't yet decided on the exact silos to send the scouts to.

For every integer *i* where 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1 the condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* holds. Next, he made *n*<=-<=1 portals, numbered by integers from 1 to *n*<=-<=1. The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) portal connects cell *i* and cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*), and one can travel from cell *i* to cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) using the *i*-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (*i*<=+<=*a**i*) to cell *i* using the *i*-th portal. It is easy to see that because of condition 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i* one can't leave the Line World using portals.\n\nCurrently, I am standing at cell 1, and I want to go to cell *t*. However, I don't know whether it is possible to go there. Please determine whether I can go to cell *t* by only using the construted transportation system.\nInput specification: The first line contains two space-separated integers *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3<=\u00d7<=104) and *t* (2<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of cells, and the index of the cell which I want to go to.\n\nThe second line contains *n*<=-<=1 space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*<=-<=1 (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=*i*). It is guaranteed, that using the given transportation system, one cannot leave the Line World.. Output specification: If I can go to cell *t* using the transportation system, print \"YES\". Otherwise, print \"NO\".\nDemo input: ['8 4\\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1\\n', '8 5\\n1 2 1 2 1 1 1\\n'], Demo output: ['YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\nNote: In the first sample, the visited cells are: 1,\u20092,\u20094; so we can successfully visit the cell 4.\n\nIn the second sample, the possible cells to visit are: 1,\u20092,\u20094,\u20096,\u20097,\u20098; so we can't visit the cell 5, which we want to visit."}]}}

Moreover, when Arcady has a non-empty prefix of some word on the screen, the editor proposes a possible autocompletion for this word, more precisely one of the already printed words such that its prefix matches the currently printed prefix if this word is unique. For example, if Arcady has already printed \u00abcodeforces\u00bb, \u00abcoding\u00bb and \u00abcodeforces\u00bb once again, then there will be no autocompletion attempt for \u00abcod\u00bb, but if he proceeds with \u00abcode\u00bb, the editor will propose \u00abcodeforces\u00bb.\n\nWith a single click Arcady can follow the editor's proposal, i.e. to transform the current prefix to it. Note that no additional symbols are printed after the autocompletion (no spaces, line feeds, etc). What is the minimum number of keyboard clicks Arcady has to perform to print the entire text, if he is not allowed to move the cursor or erase the already printed symbols?\n\nA word here is a contiguous sequence of latin letters bordered by spaces, punctuation signs and line/text beginnings/ends.

Write a python script for the following problem: Xenia the beginner programmer has a sequence *a*, consisting of 2*n* non-negative integers: *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a*2*n*. Xenia is currently studying bit operations. To better understand how they work, Xenia decided to calculate some value *v* for *a*.\n\nNamely, it takes several iterations to calculate value *v*. At the first iteration, Xenia writes a new sequence *a*1\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*2,<=*a*3\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*4,<=...,<=*a*2*n*<=-<=1\u00a0*or*\u00a0*a*2*n*, consisting of 2*n*<=-<=1 elements. In other words, she writes down the bit-wise OR of adjacent elements of sequence *a*. At the second iteration, Xenia writes the bitwise exclusive OR of adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the first iteration. At the third iteration Xenia writes the bitwise OR of the adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the second iteration. And so on; the operations of bitwise exclusive OR and bitwise OR alternate. In the end, she obtains a sequence consisting of one element, and that element is *v*.\n\nLet's consider an example. Suppose that sequence *a*<==<=(1,<=2,<=3,<=4). Then let's write down all the transformations (1,<=2,<=3,<=4) <=\u2192<= (1\u00a0*or*\u00a02<==<=3,<=3\u00a0*or*\u00a04<==<=7) <=\u2192<= (3\u00a0*xor*\u00a07<==<=4). The result is *v*<==<=4.\n\nYou are given Xenia's initial sequence. But to calculate value *v* for a given sequence would be too easy, so you are given additional *m* queries. Each query is a pair of integers *p*,<=*b*. Query *p*,<=*b* means that you need to perform the assignment *a**p*<==<=*b*. After each query, you need to print the new value *v* for the new sequence *a*.\nInput specification: The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=17,<=1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105).

In other words, it is the longest string *c* which is a prefix (the beginning) of each *s**i* for all *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*). Help Polycarpus determine the length of the city phone code.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains an integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7104) \u2014 the number of Polycarpus's friends. The following *n* lines contain strings *s*1,<=*s*2,<=...,<=*s**n* \u2014 the phone numbers of Polycarpus's friends. It is guaranteed that all strings consist only of digits and have the same length from 1 to 20, inclusive. It is also guaranteed that all strings are different.. Output specification: Print the number of digits in the city phone code.\nDemo input: ['4\\n00209\\n00219\\n00999\\n00909\\n', '2\\n1\\n2\\n', '3\\n77012345678999999999\\n77012345678901234567\\n77012345678998765432\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n', '0\\n', '12\\n']\nNote: A prefix of string *t* is a string that is obtained by deleting zero or more digits from the end of string *t*. For example, string \"00209\" has 6 prefixes: \"\" (an empty prefix), \"0\", \"00\", \"002\", \"0020\", \"00209\".\n\nIn the first sample the city phone code is string \"00\".\n\nIn the second sample the city phone code is an empty string.\n\nIn the third sample the city phone code is string \"770123456789\"."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective.

Write a python script for the following problem: Little Petya is learning to play chess. He has already learned how to move a king, a rook and a bishop. Let us remind you the rules of moving chess pieces. A chessboard is 64 square fields organized into an 8<=\u00d7<=8 table. A field is represented by a pair of integers (*r*,<=*c*) \u2014 the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:\n -  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically. -  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally. -  A king moves one field in any direction \u2014 horizontally, vertically or diagonally. \nPetya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (*r*1,<=*c*1) to field (*r*2,<=*c*2)? At that, we assume that there are no more pieces besides this one on the board.

Output specification: In the first line print a single integer *k*\u00a0\u2014 the number of different types of toys that Tanya should choose so that the number of different types of toys in her collection is maximum possible. Of course, the total cost of the selected toys should not exceed *m*.\n\nIn the second line print *k* distinct space-separated integers *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**k* (1<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=109)\u00a0\u2014 the types of toys that Tanya should choose.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, you may print any of them. Values of *t**i* can be printed in any order.\nDemo input: ['3 7\\n1 3 4\\n', '4 14\\n4 6 12 8\\n'], Demo output: ['2\\n2 5 \\n', '4\\n7 2 3 1\\n']\nNote: In the first sample mom should buy two toys: one toy of the 2-nd type and one toy of the 5-th type. At any other purchase for 7 bourles (assuming that the toys of types 1, 3 and 4 have already been bought), it is impossible to buy two and more toys."}]}}

The education is not easy because you need to have fundamental knowledge in different areas, which sometimes are not related to each other. \n\nFor example, you should know linguistics very well. You learn a structure of Reberland language as foreign language. In this language words are constructed according to the following rules. First you need to choose the \"root\" of the word \u2014 some string which has more than 4 letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3 symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction \u2014  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row. All these strings are considered to be suffixes of the word (this time we use word \"suffix\" to describe a morpheme but not the few last characters of the string as you may used to). \n\nHere is one exercise that you have found in your task list. You are given the word *s*. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language. \n\nTwo strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match. \n\nLet's look at the example: the word *abacabaca* is given. This word can be obtained in the following ways: , where the root of the word is overlined, and suffixes are marked by \"corners\". Thus, the set of possible suffixes for this word is {*aca*,<=*ba*,<=*ca*}.\nInput specification: The only line contains a string *s* (5<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=104) consisting of lowercase English letters..

The length of the root equals 5, so no string can be used as a suffix."}]}}

During one step the spy keeping the important note can pass the note to one of his neighbours in the row. In other words, if this spy's number is *x*, he can pass the note to another spy, either *x*<=-<=1 or *x*<=+<=1 (if *x*<==<=1 or *x*<==<=*n*, then the spy has only one neighbour). Also during a step the spy can keep a note and not pass it to anyone.\n\nBut nothing is that easy. During *m* steps Xenia watches some spies attentively.

Unfortunately, all soldiers died in the war and now the army consists of entirely new recruits, many of whom do not even know from which leg they should begin to march. The civilian population also poorly understands from which leg recruits begin to march, so it is only important how many soldiers march in step.\n\nThere will be *n* columns participating in the parade, the *i*-th column consists of *l**i* soldiers, who start to march from left leg, and *r**i* soldiers, who start to march from right leg.\n\nThe beauty of the parade is calculated by the following formula: if *L* is the total number of soldiers on the parade who start to march from the left leg, and *R* is the total number of soldiers on the parade who start to march from the right leg, so the beauty will equal |*L*<=-<=*R*|.\n\nNo more than once you can choose one column and tell all the soldiers in this column to switch starting leg, i.e. everyone in this columns who starts the march from left leg will now start it from right leg, and vice versa.

It should be mentioned that when a ball is thrown it may pass the beginning of the circle. For example, if *n*<==<=5, then after the third throw the child number 2 has the ball again. Overall, *n*<=-<=1 throws are made, and the game ends.\n\nThe problem is that not all the children get the ball during the game.

Write a python script for the following problem: Imagine that you have a twin brother or sister. Having another person that looks exactly like you seems very unusual. It's hard to say if having something of an alter ego is good or bad. And if you do have a twin, then you very well know what it's like.\n\nNow let's imagine a typical morning in your family. You haven't woken up yet, and Mom is already going to work. She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, *n* coins of arbitrary values *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally.\n\nAs you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. \"But why split the money equally?\" \u2014 you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.\nInput specification: The first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of coins. The second line contains a sequence of *n* integers *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the coins' values. All numbers are separated with spaces..

If you take 1 coin, you get sums 3,\u20093. If you take 0 coins, you get sums 0,\u20096. Those variants do not satisfy you as your sum should be strictly more that your twins' sum.\n\nIn the second sample one coin isn't enough for us, too. You can pick coins with values 1,\u20092 or 2,\u20092. In any case, the minimum number of coins equals 2."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Let's define the permutation of length *n* as an array *p*<==<=[*p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n*] consisting of *n* distinct integers from range from 1 to *n*. We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value *p*1, value 2 into the value *p*2 and so on.\n\nKyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a permutation. A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle). The cyclic representation is a representation of *p* as a collection of cycles forming *p*. For example, permutation *p*<==<=[4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] has a cyclic representation that looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are swapped, and 5 remains in place. \n\nPermutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya defines the standard cyclic representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first. Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation of [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] is (421)(5)(63).\n\nNow, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For instance, [4,<=1,<=6,<=2,<=5,<=3] will become [4,<=2,<=1,<=5,<=6,<=3].\n\nKyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of length *n* that do not change in a list in lexicographic order. Unfortunately, his friend Tamaki Suoh lost this list. Kyoya wishes to reproduce the list and he needs your help. Given the integers *n* and *k*, print the permutation that was *k*-th on Kyoya's list.\nInput specification: The first line will contain two integers *n*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*min*{1018,<=*l*} where *l* is the length of the Kyoya's list).. Output specification: Print *n* space-separated integers, representing the permutation that is the answer for the question.\nDemo input: ['4 3\\n', '10 1\\n'], Demo output: ['1 3 2 4\\n', '1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\\n']\nNote: The standard cycle representation is (1)(32)(4), which after removing parenthesis gives us the original permutation. The first permutation on the list would be [1,\u20092,\u20093,\u20094], while the second permutation would be [1,\u20092,\u20094,\u20093]."}]}}

Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program $a$ in next manner: at moment $0$ turns power and light on. Then at moment $a_i$ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment $1$ and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be $1$. Finally, at moment $M$ the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program $a$, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of $a$, or even at the begining or at the end of $a$.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from $x$ till moment $y$, then its lit for $y - x$ units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\nInput specification: First line contains two space separated integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $2 \\le M \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the length of program $a$ and the moment when power turns off.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n &lt; M$) \u2014 initially installed program $a$.. Output specification: Print the only integer \u2014 maximum possible total time when the lamp is lit.\nDemo input: ['3 10\\n4 6 7\\n', '2 12\\n1 10\\n', '2 7\\n3 4\\n'], Demo output: ['8\\n', '9\\n', '6\\n']\nNote: In the first example, one of possible optimal solutions is to insert value $x = 3$ before $a_1$, so program will be $[3, 4, 6, 7]$ and time of lamp being lit equals $(3 - 0) + (6 - 4) + (10 - 7) = 8$. Other possible solution is to insert $x = 5$ in appropriate place.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert $x = 2$ between $a_1$ and $a_2$. Program will become $[1, 2, 10]$, and answer will be $(1 - 0) + (10 - 2) = 9$.\n\nIn the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be $(3 - 0) + (7 - 4) = 6$."}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!\n\nLeha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers *A* and *B* and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"*A* factorial\" and \"*B* factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(*A*!,<=*B*!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer *x* is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to *x*. Thus *x*!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(*x*<=-<=1)\u00b7*x*. For example 4!<==<=1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74<==<=24. Recall that GCD(*x*,<=*y*) is the largest positive integer *q* that divides (without a remainder) both *x* and *y*.\n\nLeha has learned how to solve this task very effective.

That's why a question arises: \"Which integer type to use if one wants to store a positive integer *n*?\"\n\nPetya knows only 5 integer types:\n\n1) byte occupies 1 byte and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=128 to 127\n\n2) short occupies 2 bytes and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=32768 to 32767\n\n3) int occupies 4 bytes and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=2147483648 to 2147483647\n\n4) long occupies 8 bytes and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807\n\n5) BigInteger can store any integer number, but at that it is not a primitive type, and operations with it are much slower.\n\nFor all the types given above the boundary values are included in the value range.\n\nFrom this list, Petya wants to choose the smallest type that can store a positive integer *n*.

As a sign of the highest achievements of the deceased king the new king decided to build a mausoleum with Berl IV's body on the main square of the capital.\n\nThe mausoleum will be constructed from 2*n* blocks, each of them has the shape of a cuboid. Each block has the bottom base of a 1<=\u00d7<=1 meter square. Among the blocks, exactly two of them have the height of one meter, exactly two have the height of two meters, ..., exactly two have the height of *n* meters.\n\nThe blocks are arranged in a row without spacing one after the other. Of course, not every arrangement of blocks has the form of a mausoleum. In order to make the given arrangement in the form of the mausoleum, it is necessary that when you pass along the mausoleum, from one end to the other, the heights of the blocks first were non-decreasing (i.e., increasing or remained the same), and then \u2014 non-increasing (decrease or remained unchanged). It is possible that any of these two areas will be omitted. For example, the following sequences of block height meet this requirement:\n -  [1,<=2,<=2,<=3,<=4,<=4,<=3,<=1]; -  [1,<=1]; -  [2,<=2,<=1,<=1]; -  [1,<=2,<=3,<=3,<=2,<=1]. \nSuddenly, *k* more requirements appeared. Each of the requirements has the form: \"*h*[*x**i*] sign*i* *h*[*y**i*]\", where *h*[*t*] is the height of the *t*-th block, and a sign*i* is one of the five possible signs: '=' (equals), '&lt;' (less than), '&gt;' (more than), '&lt;=' (less than or equals), '&gt;=' (more than or equals). Thus, each of the *k* additional requirements is given by a pair of indexes *x**i*, *y**i* (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=2*n*) and sign sign*i*.\n\nFind the number of possible ways to rearrange the blocks so that both the requirement about the shape of the mausoleum (see paragraph 3) and the *k* additional requirements were met.\nInput specification: The first line of the input contains integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=35, 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of pairs of blocks and the number of additional requirements.\n\nNext *k* lines contain listed additional requirements, one per line in the format \"*x**i* sign*i* *y**i*\" (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=2*n*), and the sign is on of the list of the five possible signs..

That is, you can go from any empty cell to any other one. Pavel doesn't like it when his maze has too little walls. He wants to turn exactly *k* empty cells into walls so that all the remaining cells still formed a connected area. Help him.\nInput specification: The first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=500, 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=&lt;<=*s*), where *n* and *m* are the maze's height and width, correspondingly, *k* is the number of walls Pavel wants to add and letter *s* represents the number of empty cells in the original maze.\n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains *m* characters. They describe the original maze. If a character on a line equals \".\", then the corresponding cell is empty and if the character equals \"#\", then the cell is a wall.. Output specification: Print *n* lines containing *m* characters each: the new maze that fits Pavel's requirements. Mark the empty cells that you transformed into walls as \"X\", the other cells must be left without changes (that is, \".\" and \"#\").\n\nIt is guaranteed that a solution exists. If there are multiple solutions you can output any of them.\nDemo input: ['3 4 2\\n#..#\\n..#.\\n#...\\n', '5 4 5\\n#...\\n#.#.\\n.#..\\n...#\\n.#.#\\n'], Demo output: ['#.X#\\nX.#.\\n#...\\n', '#XXX\\n#X#.\\nX#..\\n...#\\n.#.#\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: The German University in Cairo (GUC) dorm houses are numbered from 1 to *n*. Underground water pipes connect these houses together. Each pipe has certain direction (water can flow only in this direction and not vice versa), and diameter (which characterizes the maximal amount of water it can handle).\n\nFor each house, there is at most one pipe going into it and at most one pipe going out of it. With the new semester starting, GUC student and dorm resident, Lulu, wants to install tanks and taps at the dorms. For every house with an outgoing water pipe and without an incoming water pipe, Lulu should install a water tank at that house. For every house with an incoming water pipe and without an outgoing water pipe, Lulu should install a water tap at that house. Each tank house will convey water to all houses that have a sequence of pipes from the tank to it. Accordingly, each tap house will receive water originating from some tank house.\n\nIn order to avoid pipes from bursting one week later (like what happened last semester), Lulu also has to consider the diameter of the pipes. The amount of water each tank conveys should not exceed the diameter of the pipes connecting a tank to its corresponding tap.

Having learned the news, the colonel ordered to all *n* squad soldiers to line up on the parade ground.\n\nBy the military charter the soldiers should stand in the order of non-increasing of their height.

The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:\n 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=\u2264<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.  Let ; 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*l*,<=*mid*); 1.  Call *mergesort*(*a*,<=*mid*,<=*r*); 1.  Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* \u2014 *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\nInput specification: The first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it..

Otherwise output *n* integer numbers *a*[0],<=*a*[1],<=...,<=*a*[*n*<=-<=1] \u2014 the elements of a permutation that would meet the required conditions. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\nDemo input: ['3 3\\n', '4 1\\n', '5 6\\n'], Demo output: ['2 1 3 ', '1 2 3 4 ', '-1\\n']\nNote: none"}]}}

Write a python script for the following problem: Merge sort is a well-known sorting algorithm. The main function that sorts the elements of array *a* with indices from [*l*,<=*r*) can be implemented as follows:\n 1.  If the segment [*l*,<=*r*) is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any *i* such that *l*<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*r*<=-<=1 *a*[*i*]<=\u2264<=*a*[*i*<=+<=1]), then end the function call; 1.

Merge segments [*l*,<=*mid*) and [*mid*,<=*r*), making the segment [*l*,<=*r*) sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn't call any other functions. \nThe array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call *mergesort*(*a*,<=0,<=*n*).\n\nThe number of calls of function *mergesort* is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if *a*<==<={1,<=2,<=3,<=4}, then there will be 1 call of *mergesort* \u2014 *mergesort*(0,<=4), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If *a*<==<={2,<=1,<=3}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call *mergesort*(0,<=3), which then sets *mid*<==<=1 and calls *mergesort*(0,<=1) and *mergesort*(1,<=3), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,<=1) and (1,<=3) are sorted.\n\nIvan has implemented the program that counts the number of *mergesort* calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array *a* such that *a* is a permutation of size *n* (that is, the number of elements in *a* is *n*, and every integer number from [1,<=*n*] can be found in this array), and the number of *mergesort* calls when sorting the array is exactly *k*.\n\nHelp Ivan to find an array he wants!\nInput specification: The first line contains two numbers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100000, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=200000) \u2014 the size of a desired permutation and the number of *mergesort* calls required to sort it..
